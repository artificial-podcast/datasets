Hermione reached down to run her hand slowly up his arm, tracing the outline of his fingers with her fingers. 

 "Granger, c'mon," She drawled, making him feel like he was being dragged in a cage. 

 "I’m not." 

 "Still not," She replied, pulling him closer. 

 "I’m a little hungry," He smiled, feeling guilty about it. 

 "I’ be back in a moment."

"You’re going to be fine," Theo smiled, and Draco was waiting for her to respond.

"I’ll get you some sleep then."

"OK," Theo smiled, and Draco sat up.

"So good to see you again," he said, feeling like he wasn’t hiding anything.

"Come on, Theo, you’re going to be late for the party." Hermione’s eyes widened at the idea of him doing something stupid that she didn’t intend to do. Theo gripped her waist tightly and she wrapped her arms around him. The way his features softened as she walked down the aisle, the tiny smile on her face, the way the way his lips pressed against hers, the way her body pressed herself against his."Yeah, okay, okay, I’m not going to lie to you Harry said, pushing his jeans down his thighs."I’ll go get some of my clothes, I’ll leave you the night before, aye," Ron said, grabbing her dress and pulling her on top of him."What about the night before?" Draco asked."I don’t have any, no, but Ron’s already dressed, and I’m going to be back at the house for some breakfast." 

 Hermione sighed.

"I’m not going to change anything." 

 "What?" 

 "I’m not going to change anything, but I’ll do the Quidditch match tomorrow." 

 "God, are you going to send me off to the castle for something?" Draco asked, glancing down at the book on his lap. 

  my god, I love you, Hermione." He turned to Hermione, holding the page out like a sword.

"I love you too, Hermione." He said in a hushed voice, and Hermione nodded as they exited the library, which was still busy. 

 Hermione pressed her lips together while Ron looked at him, his eyes wide as he scratched a little at the book.

"You can help us find what you need."

"Hey I’ve got it," Draco said, grabbing the book in his hands.

"You said you’ll find it eventually. You and I both know what you’ve been up to."

"Fine."

"If you don’t mind."Draco looked down.

"How about we go back to the Ministry?"

"I’ll go with you."

"If you don’t want that, you can go back to your room and ask Mr. Weasley to bring me a glass of water."

"I’ll do it."

"You’re welcome to do it."

"I’m a mental person, Mr. Weasley," he said as he turned to leave."I’ll have it with the judge soon."

"You’re welcome. 

 The judge walked over and looked at the two, who were staring. The judge glanced at the two before looking at the two, who were both frowning."I’ll see you guys later." 

 The judge looked at the two before stepping up and left."You’re welcome." 

 The judge turned and walked to the door.He looked at the two, who were watching the three, who were now sitting at a table in the back of the house. 

 The three sat in silence for a long moment, and then the two said something to the others. 

 "What did you have to say before we moved in together?" 

 "Oh, that’s right, I have to thank you for that." 

 "Mmh, that’s right, you hear me?" 

 "Fuck you. blinked."He’s a fucking bitch. Did you see what he did to Harry?"

"Watch it," Harry said softly.

"I’ve never seen him like that before."

"I’m going to miss him so much," Ron said sarcastically.Harry looked at him."I’m going to miss him so much," Ron said quickly and then shoved his hands in the pockets of his shirt. The cool breeze hit the back of his shirt instead, making Ron’s shirt look even more hot. He stepped up to the door, staring at it as he walked. 

 "Ron?" 

 "Harry," Ron said, but then stopped. 

 Harry looked at him, his eyes wide and the look in his eyes. He was surprised to see that Harry had a somewhat hard look on him. 

 " the one who’s going to have to put up a fight." Lavender looked at him, both amused and slightly worried, "No, he’ll be fine."

"That’s my plan." Harry reached for Hermione, before he whispered a few words into her earlobe.

"We’ll do this." He walked over and stopped to accept another drink.

"I’ going to have to go out soon." 

 "Okay," Hermione said, feeling frustrated.

"But I’m keeping my promise," She said, wanting to say something that would make him turn on her. 

 "Yes," Ron said, looking at her with a smile.

"I’m going to be out soon." 

 "Are you going to tell me?" She begged her voice low. A voice that had no meaning. Truth was a lost cause. He couldn’t give her time to think about the things she’d said before, but he was meant to remain silent."Are you going to tell me what you’ve been doing to me?" The old man asked, leaning against the wall next to her bed."No, you’re not." She said, startled. Her voice was muffled and her lips were so hard she almost drooled. She quickly wiped her mouth and swallowed, "I’m sorry. I don’t know what to do."

"What’s wrong?" she asked, looking at his hands in frustration."Nothing." He said, looking down at his shoes and then up at her."I’m sorry, Draco. I don’t know how to go on without you." Ginny said as she closed her eyes and shut her eyes.Hermione nodded.

"I just don’t know how to go on without him." He beamed."I’m sorry," Ginny said as she wiped her eyes."You’re not going to go on without me," Draco said, and his breath caught."I’ll go," Ginny agreed.  we’ll make sure you’re okay?"Ginny nodded and started pacing.

"I told you, I’m going to be alright, Draco. I’m going to have a good night’s sleep, I promise."

"I’ll be fine," Draco said, his voice low.

"I’ll be fine."Ginny gave him a heavy look and Draco didn like the look. Hermione could tell that his face was soft, but her heart was beating like mad.

"But you wouldn’t be able to give me a word."Draco let go of Ginny and dropped his head into the pillow as he sat up stiffly.

"Come here."

"We’ll talk later."Hermione only sighed and shook her head.

"I’ll be back in a minute to get you in some more of your company." 

 "Come on then, Harry!" she said, glancing at him with curiosity.

"I’ve got a new job to complete, I’ve got to get out of this place now." 

 "No, I’m not going to stay here to rot in the temporary wing," he smirked.

"You can leave, that’s all. I’ll know about this, Draco." 

 "I’ll do it," she said, looking thoughtful. 

 "I’ll, Draco," he said, a bit disappointed that she was hoping to get him by his side. 

 "Good," She said, a bit disappointed that she was going to get him by his side, but he’d probably never get to see her again He’d been thinking that way for the last six months. 

 She’d known that she’d never see him again. 

 "You’re a good friend," Ron said, looking down at the green and gold glass table, "I mean, it’s nice to see you, but I think I can’t do it." 

 Ron’s face softened with relief, "You can do it, alright?" Severus met his eyes with a smile, "That’s a good thing." 

 "I hope you are." He gave her a small smile, "It’s best if you go with me…I’ll be there." 

 "No, I don’t want to." She stepped out of the shower to get ready, "I’ll be back with Harry in a little while." 

 "We’ll see." 

 "I’ll be right back." 

 "Oh, I’m sorry, I’ll be at the bar," Hermione said, leaning back in her chair. 

 "What?" Sirius said, as he pulled his cloak up and threw it down. 

 "It’s after curfew," she said, and the rest of the house turned into a bright green glow.

"I’ll be in an hour or so to just get out of here."A moment later, Draco was standing outside the door of the castle, the room around him in this time. He started walking towards the door, and Hermione turned and looked at him.

"I’ll be sure to come with you."

"Alright, then. The door appeared before him. In the hall, the staircase to the Gryffindor Common Room was a familiar sight. A pair of blonde students approached the door, the two girls trailing behind them. He had no idea which one they were, but when he had to go back to his room, he had to go with Harry.His girlfriend looked at him with a smile.

"Are you okay?"

"I'm fine," he said.

"I just... it’s different. I mean, I’m not going to a Muggle school, but... but I don’t know if I can take a break; I’m going to be okay."He sighed.

"I’ll see you around." 

 Merlin, he’s a freak.He walked over to the bathroom, and sat down next to Hermione. He leaned back and kissed the top of her head.

"Hermione. This is for you." 

 "Mmhm." He threaded a hand through her hair. Her eyes fluttered open and her eyes instantly shot open in surprise. He looked like he was trying to tell her the truth, but this made her heart jump. 

 "I'm sorry, Hermione, I didn't mean to—" 

 "I'm sorry, I'm not sorry," she cleared her throat. 

 "I'm sorry, Hermione, I'm just glad to have you there, I'm not sure I'll be able to get you home to see if you're okay."

"More, I'd like to stop by your place tomorrow, if you're comfortable in there. I'm sure you'll be able to figure out a way to get to me."

"Yeah, I'm sure, Hermione," he added, flicking his eyes to the door to the kitchen, looking around and noting the sparsely decorated table that sat inside.

"I don know that I'll miss it."Hermione bit her lip and rolled her eyes.

"There's nothing wrong with staying in London, no matter what."

"How about we go get some coffee?"

"I can go with you when you're ready. I've got a meeting with a couple of Aurors, and a few of our Aurors are already looking for possible targets." Harry turned to walk away, before turning back to Hermione.

"I need something for today."

"You're not going to think I'm an arse."

"No, you're not. I'm just a busy student." He smirked at her, his face so serious he almost broke down.

"So, what do you need?"

"I'm going to work out something."

"Sounds good, right?" Hermione nodded.

"I'll get your permission to go to lunch." 

 Monday morning was a long day for Hermione and Harry, but the wedding itself was the highlight. The day was a day without sleep or pain in the middle of the night, without the smell of alcohol and the smell of cigarettes. The morning was a good one, a day of fresh air and fresh memories.The first few weeks of school were full of drama. One day, Ron was playing Quidditch with his cousin, when he was knocked down by an unfamiliar wizard. The Slytherin boy was about to run to him when he heard the Slytherin boy scream in pain. It was Ron's turn to scream now. 

 Ron stared at the floor for another few seconds, looking for the boy. His eyes were flicked around the room, his mouth slightly open as he continued to scream. 

 Ron shoved the boy against the wall and dragged him toward the corridor. 

 "I have to tell you something. I have to tell you." 

 "What about you, Ron?" 

 Ron smirked at him.

"I not that dumb, I’d never say that to you."he teased."You’re right, Ron. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable." He kissed her back and smiled, the air in his lungs filled with the scent of her.

"I’m glad I’m not going to meet your eyes again, but I know you won’t be going to anywhere else 

 "I’ll go," Theo said, dropping her in the chair next to her. 

 "I won’t," she said sarcastically, still unable to hold back her smile. 

 "I don’t know," Theo said, looking away from Hermione in confusion. 

 "Yes, you don’t know. 

 "I know you don Harry said, looking at her with interest."I’m sorry. It’s just, I don’t know how to explain it," she said, and Harry couldn’t help but chuckle.

"I didn’t know you thought I’d be the best witch in a million years," she said, "I was just saying I don’t know how to explain it." She looked at him with concern.

"I’d like to know how." He sighed.

"I mean, I’ve seen some other people’s stories and I’m more than happy to help." He looked at her, a little grumpy.

"But you’ll have to take care of yourself." She looked at him, a sad look on her face.

"I’ll be right back she said, and when he looked at her, he looked back at her with a sad smile. 

 "You’re not," Draco said, looking down at the note. His lips were at his heart-shaped, the tears that seeped from his eyes.

"You’re right, I’ll be right back." 

 She shot a glance at him, a worried look on her face.

"Thank you." 

 "I’m sorry, I’m sorry," He muttered, looking at her with a sorrowful look. He turned back to face her. 

 "It’s fine, I’m trying to get over it," She whispered, feeling her heart shatter. 

 "We’re not going to hurt her," He said quietly, looking away from her. 

 A soft proud smile spread across her face as Draco turned to look at him.

"I love you," He said with a soft smile.He had a soft smile. It was brilliant. He thought she was a gorgeous woman. His heart pounded in his chest slightly. He had to get out of this place, Draco thought. He wasn’t going to leave. He didn’t even think she would.

"So how does this work?" He asked, looking to Hermione from inside.

"You can go back to the castle and not worry about it. You are allowed to come all the time, and we can get you a room together if you want it." 

 She nodded, but said nothing. She was just anxious to get out of the castle and away from the mess. She’d gotten used to being in the Manor.
