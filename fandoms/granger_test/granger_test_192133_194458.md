He let the bottoms of his legs rest on his shoulders, keeping the water flowing through the cuffs on either side of his arms. He hadn't noticed how much he enjoyed the water, and he hoped the water wasn't too hot that day. 

 The moment slipped away, and he nodded to himself, trying to get himself back on track. 

 Harry had come to the realization that he wasn't going to be alone in the water. 

 Molly had waited for him to come back around the corner and now she was going to have to worry about it. She had not seen him since last night. For some reason, she found she didn't want to be alone when she did. The last Portkey to the Manor had arrived, having been stolen from her by the twins. Molly had checked the time and was unable to get any further. She had been sitting at the far end of the hall, talking to her best friend for a few hours. Even though she had not spent the entire day in the room, Dumbledore's eyes were on her as he rested his head against the wall.He acted as though he were a part of her, pulling her closer to him. The tension built in her body and the feeling of his presence was intoxicating. 

 "I swear to you, I am going to be absolutely unhinged." 

 Dumbledore leaned over and kissed her forehead.

"I haven't spoken to you for a while." 

 She felt herself freeze up for a moment before she removed her hand from her face and turned back to look at him. He gave her a hesitant smile.

"Yes, I know it's a bit hard to believe. I mean, I used to feel this way about you. You can't deny it. I've been fighting with you for some time now." She looked up at him.

"So, we were going to be friends, but then—" He gestured for a moment, and then turned to her.

"What do you want, you little witch?" 

 "I just don't know how to get out of this fucking wall," she said breathlessly. 

 "You'll have to love me." 

 "But you don't need to love me," he said in a whisper.

"I just aren't ready for it yet. I can't do it. I want to be with my family." 

 Hermione's mouth fell open. This was not the first time I've heard her say that. I don't know whether it was over the music, or the blood. I'm not sure. I've heard that she's a Muggle-born and has never mouthed that she's going to be a Muggle-born." I heard her lips parting, her eyes moving up to meet mine.

"I'm not sure how I got here. I've heard it only at home." I'm not sure what I'm doing here to get out of this. I don't know how to get out and I don't have the money to do so." Harry just shook his head."I don't even want to go out with you and do it alone. I'm not even sure if I should go with you or not. But, if I do, I'll do it. You're going to be so much more comfortable than I am." He gave me a smiling smile and I nodded.

"Alright, I'll see you in a bit."

"Fine, then I'll be here in a few minutes."

"Yeah, I'll see you in a minute then, you'll see. And, if you meet your right, I'm sure you'll make it to the bars first thing in the morning."

"Alright, I'll put on my uniform and walk by the door."I nodded and walked out of the room.

"I'll be back in a bit."

"Yeah, I'll be back in a bit, I'll see you in a bit. I'll be back in a bit later. I promise," He said but still didn't say anything. He tried to get out of bed, but he couldn't. He kept his head up and just stared at the ceiling. He was scared of the memory of Lucius Malfoy. He didn't want to forget about Lucius.He reached out and pushed his wand out, but Lucius wasn't looking at his wand. He threw it back into the muggle world and waited for the light to come back."I am as much of a skeptic of magic as you are. I always thought that magic was more powerful than a soul. I am just not that way." He said quietly, making a face."But I am not as powerful as you and you are just as much of an idiot." He continued, looking at her with his eyes."I am the worst. I am a perfect example of a wizard who can't even think, is just a fucking idiot." She said, looking at him.

"I-I can't." She said stupidly, the words twisted in her voice."You were the one who said you were going to kill me. That's how you became a rabid nutter. You had to just say the thing. That's how you got yourself killed. I didn't want to admit it, but you were right. You were wrong." He said, his voice low and quiet.

"I was just thinking that maybe you were a really nice person," he said quietly.

"And I was thinking maybe you were actually good for the game. I've known you for a while now. I know you came here to play. I was a little surprised you didn't wanna come here."She sighed.

"I guess that's why I asked you to come here."She opened the door and laid down next to him and looked back up into his face.

"I think you're wearing better than you used to," he said softly "A little taller, too. I'm sure you've been to the Blizzard."Draco grinned.

"Get a hold of yourself. Look good." He smiled at her, and the rest of the group followed suit. The Gryffindors went to the bathroom to wash their hands.

"What do I wear?"

"It's so simple, I thought I'd ask, but it's so hard to explain," Draco said, and Pansy smiled at him.

"I think we're done here!"Malfoy didn't say anything, but the crowd was still in the crowd.

"I'm glad to see you five, Pansy," He said, reaching out, and Pansy was gone."I'm glad too, Draco," she said, looking disappointed."Of course you are," Draco said, looking at her with a tight gaze.

"Now, you're going to be my friend." She clapped Draco on the shoulder, and he nodded in agreement.

"I have to go get some more time before the exam. I can't be late for the exam."

"Did you have a free period?"

"It's not a free period, Hermione," Draco mumbled as he attempted to get out of his seat.

"I'd rather spend more time with my family than being on my own for the exam."

"That's not a fair assessment," Hermione said.

"I'm sure you'll be fine. I'm not going to sit by and watch you die."There he was.

"I'm sure you're going to be fine, too."

"Good," he said slowly and with a smile, but he pulled her in closer.

"I'm glad. You're more than welcome to come with me. It's just so hard to keep up with all of this."She smiled, her mouth slightly open as she took his hand.

"The only thing I want to do today is do something I love, and I want to do it with you."

"Yes, you might, but that's not what I want right now."

"And yet I do want you, too. I want you to think about it, to think about the choices that you've made, to think about how you want to be with me instead of just thinking about it. I want you to know I love you, so much more than we have ever done together before, that I'm not going to let you down unless you aren't going to do it for me." He'd been so defiant, but she was sure it would take her more than that.

"I don't know how to fix this. I don't know how to get you to do it. I just don't know how to fix this. I'm not doing it for you. You're a-" Hermione stopped, looking down at her hands.

"I'm not doing it for you. You're not doing it for me. If you want to come to my room and do anything with me every day, then I'll be fine with it." She smiled at him a little too hard and then looked back at his bed and smiled again. She leaned back against the bed and quickly covered her mouth with her hands. 

 "I’ll have you know I am going to force you to share the bed with me." 

 "I’ll have you know I’m going to make sure you have a bed with me and a blanket for me."

"I’ll make sure you sleep well," Hermione said, relieved that she was doing something right. She was a lot better at sleeping than her mother was.

"I’m going to make sure you’re good for Christmas," Ron said, and Hermione lifted her brows in surprise, and then turned back to him.

"You’re going to have to be careful, Potter." 

 Theo transformed into a half-cocked man and sniffled, but Percy ignored him.

"Theo’s going to be alright. I’ll be worried for him," he said as he pulled himself together. 

 It turned out that Percy had been in the Ministry trying to track down the missing girl. As he watched the red headed man, Percy’s eyes went wide, and he tried to open them but couldn’t. He sighed, put the bag on the table and rushed to the door. The door opened and he was greeted by his old housekeeper.

"Come in, Harry!" She greeted him, and he looked at her with a smile.

"He’s a lot more familiar with you than I am," He said, standing up and putting the bag on the table with a smile on his face. He stood and slid his hand down Harry's trousers, exposing the knickers of both men. Harry pushed the buttons on the trousers, exposing the lacy white button-up."You’re a cunt." He told Harry.

"I’m not."

"I don’t care."

"Did you know the blond boy you’ve been fantasizing about is his godfather?"

"Did you know the couple if you were to look at me, I’d be a single mother and I’d be a murdered man," Harry’s voice was heavy with emotion."I’d be a tenacious lawyer, Harry."

"I know that, don’t you?"

"That’s a long story," Harry said, walking closer and looking down at her with determination."You’ve been fantas about me," he said, smiling at her.

"How did you find out about that?"

"I’d never admit it," she said, as she opened her lips to speak.

"I’ll let you see," she said, not looking at him."I’m going to try and get you to shut up."

"That’s not what I was thinking." He looked at her."Thank you."

"I didn’t realize you were such a chocolate thing." She looked up at him."I’ll talk to you later."

"I’ll be sure." She felt his smile on her face."What about you?"

"I don’t know."She thought for a moment. Was he going to tell her? He had been in the middle of a very heated relationship with a man who had established himself as a spy in the Wizarding World and was now officially a spy for the Ministry?Of course, he would tell her."I’m not going to tell you about this."He moved to stand up.

"Get the hell off me, you prick."

"How did you know I’d be a spy?"

"I don’ know," she said, her voice troubled. She felt herself relax, as if being an idiot was not the worst idea."I sent you two a message before you left."

"Your letter said I had been out of town with you. I’m sorry you were late because I’m glad you were."

"Your letter said I was an Unspeakable."

"I’m sorry you were always so desperate."

"Yes, I was," she said, looking down at the letter and hoping to polity herself.

"I still have a lot of work to do."

"Yes, you are, I’ll give you a couple of weeks before that."

"Okay, I’ll make the time. I’ll see you at the Burrow, when you are ready, I’ll put you in touch with a Malfoy familiar, as well as a Christmas present." 

 "Good timing," Harry said, sitting up and pulling out the paper. The door was flung open, but the men’s agreement was enough. 

 "Harry," Ron said, "I’m going to have to go now." 

 "No," Harry said and waved him off, "I’m not going to start."

"Yeah," Ron said quietly.

"I’m not going to stop."

"Harry," Ginny said, her voice a little hoarse.

"I’m alright."

"Come on, Ron," he said, taking a step back.

"You’re all right there."

"Yeah," Ginny said, a little smirk on her face.  it’s the only book I have yet to use in our library."

"I haven’t used it," Ron said, looking at her.

"I have. I’m just not ready."

"You’re not ready," Ginny said, looking at his eyes.

"Winning the book?"

"No," Ron said, staring at her.

"You didn’t win it."

"Yeah, I did. I don’t remember what it was, but it was a book by the same name."

"I don’t remember what it was."

"Yes you did."

"You were…you were…"

"I was…I was…"Ron pulled her into his arms and kissed her.

"I used to have a lot of good memories, but I'm not here for you anymore." She said, and he was thankful for that.

"I’m here for you."

"You’re not going to listen to me when I tell you everything about how I treated you." Harry picked up the bottle of ice cream and poured it into his mouth. She pushed the spoon back, making sure it was covered."You’re not going to listen to me when you try and do what I say." He pulled his wand from his pocket and took a long hold of the hair."What if we don’t?" She asked and Draco raised his eyebrows."Well, if you don’t want to listen to me then that’s fine with me. You can get your wand back and do as I say and just concentrate. Then you’ll be ready to go." She stowed the bag on his chest and turned to face the man. 

 "I don’t know what I’m gonna do with this." Draco licked his lips and realized her presence. 

 "Be careful." 

 "I’m not a coward," She must have told her. 

 "You’re a coward," Draco said. 

 "I’ll bet. bet," Shannon said, and Draco tried to sound as sensible as he could.

"We’re going to do this the first time."

"You’re going to do it first-"

"I’m not going to go ahead and do it yourself," Draco said, not saying anything about it.

"So, I’m going to do it myself, and not just because I know you’re going to tease me," Draco ground out.

"Do you need a cologne?" He shifted the chair so it was flush against the wall.

"No, I’ve got it handy." He sat back and began to wipe the shower robe off of her legs.
