So what was she doing working in a tea parlour?"

"Well, it was when I was planning to go to the main line of a restaurant in London. I had been thinking about going back to the States and decided to get the green tea shop there, which I did. I also had a little plan for the next month, which was to buy a couple of airdros and a couple of bottles of tea, but the money was too tight. So I promptly bought one, but I was planning to order another one at a later date I'm not saying I want to, but I'll try to do it this time. It was the best idea. I think you'll like it. I'm sure you'll like it." 

 "Promise me?" 

 "I promise." A small smile curled her lips.

"Promise me." 

 She did, but she didn’t have the energy or the determination to do so. The taunt of the thought. 

 "I suppose that’s enough for now." He said, his eyes swinging back in a bright smile. 

 "I’ll come back with more when you get back." Hermione said. 

 "Yeah, you’ll be right." Draco said, leaning down to kiss her. 

 "Thank you." Hermione said, kissing him again. 

 " going on vacation." Viktor said, his eyes still on Harry. Harry smiled.

"I said stay." He sighed.

"I’ll be back in a bit." He said, looking worried. Hermione smiled, a bit relieved to be back in her flat.

"Well, I’ll see you back." Viktor said to her, feeling relieved that she would be back. She nodded and smiled. They walked away from the Manor and headed downstairs, hoping to find out what had happened.It was time for them to get to know each other. Hermione and Ginny would not hold their noses in the elaborate kitchenette, as the two girls had agreed with each other that it would be a good time to start dating. At the same time, her and Ginny would be spending time together.Hermione and Ginny walked into the dining room and sat down opposite to each other, folding their plates. Ginny was taking a seat in the lap of her husband's lap and drawing attention to themselves. 

 "What the fuck are you doing here, Weasley?" She continued, looking around at the crowd.

"You’re the one who’s been fucking raped." 

 "You’re the one who’s been fucking raped." 

 "I don’t think there’s a fucking thing to be fucking sure about, Theo." 

 "No, I’m not," he said, shaking his head. 

 "What’s the deal, now?" 

 "I don’t think I’d like this." 

 "What’d I do, Theo?" 

 "Well, I’m not really sure." 

 "Justin," Theo said, giving her a small smile and an arm around her.

"But…I’ll have to look into it, and I’m sure you’ll get it." He looked at the desk.

"You’ll be a lot of fun." Theo followed her down the hall and turned to give her a look.

"You know I’m pretty much a head full of surprises.
