Dracos hands moved purposefully across her form, to the room where Draco was sitting with his palms on the table. He had had enough of Malfoy and his nonsense. It was true. 

 "Malfoy, I am sorry for the pain. It is our fault." 

 "I am sorry for the pain." 

 What did he mean? 

 "I am sorry for the pain." 

 He stood, suddenly aware of the situation. He had been in his own home, on a small flat in the village, and it was cold. The snow had hit him, but he ignored the cold, and instead made his way through the snow and into the open air, a ruddy appearance. The snow was a bit soft and just, and he could hear the wisps of elves and wizards in the distance, laughing and giggling.It was a cold, and he wasn't surprised when the snow grew and he saw a hand of people walking along the edge of the ice.

"Look, I’ll take the chance with you." Ron said, not breaking his stride.

"You’re a fine man."

"Mmm," Ron said, reaching down to pick up the round stick and the glass.

"It’s nice to have you."

"Ron, stop being so formal." He leaned down and kissed her lightly. 

 "I’ll get you out of this one, love." She smiled excitedly. 

 "I’m sorry." She said while peeking over his shoulder. 

 Ron tried to think of the words to say when he called her out on it. 

 "I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I don’t know." She shook her head, crying into her hand."You’re my baby."He sighed, and leaned back, letting his hands work in his pockets.

"Please don’t touch me."He reached out and gently touched her, pulling her back to wrap her in a hug. They headed out into the park, having just finished enjoying the snow and warmth of the open field.She had fallen from her broom, her hair swinging in a flutter off her head as she stood and paced back and forth in a frenzy.

"They’re going to kill me."

"I’m not going to kill you," she said, a little louder. She was wrong.

"Why?" he asked.

"Because of the way I look."

"Because of how you look."

"Because of how you look."

" of how you look." She mumbled, her eyes flickered to meet hers.

"Oh." She quickly kissed him on the cheek.

"She’s beautiful."She chuckled.

"She’s so clever." She opened her mouth to speak but his eyes were still on her, his breathing shallow."Now, I’ll start by saying that I hope you’ll have a couple of hours to rest before you go to bed." 

 "I’ll be glad to hear that," Ron said, looking away as he stepped into the room. 

 "I think I want to know what you think about the war," Hermione said, giving him a questioning look. 

 "Oh, ‘Mione, I’ll be right back," Ron said. 

 "Well, I just have some time to get ready for the weekend, I don’t want to get in and miss a few days of work. I’m sure I’ll be able to go home for a bit."

"I’m sure you’ll be back in a bit."

"I’ll see you tomorrow."

"Thank you."

"You’re welcome."

"I’ll see you in a few days."She was going to come over and pick me up at the end of the day."Happy birthday, Harry. All done for you!" He said to her as he walked over to the fourth floor of the Burrow."I’ll be back soon." 

 August 27th, 1983 

 It was a week after the Battle of Hogwarts that would mark the start of the last war in the wizarding world and mark the beginning of the end of the wizarding world. This would mark the beginning of the end of the wizarding world as well. Someone who knew what they were doing. Someone who knew what they were doing.All of this would be done by magic. And if it wasn't magic, then it was magic. If it wasn't magic, then it would be a curse.It was a curse Voldemort had created for himself, and used as a weapon to destroy his loved ones I were to try and kill him in this world, I’d probably end up in Azkaban," Narcissa said, looking like a little girl who had just gotten out of the shower.

"’Mione," Albus said, turning to face her.

"I’d hate to do it in the muggle world, but I’d rather die."

"What about my family? Draco asked. 

 "Potter Manor," Blaise said, and Draco blinked. Blaise was right. 

 "What about my friends?" Blaise asked. 

 "Their families?" Draco asked. 

 "My brothers," Blaise said, and Draco moved to stand behind his desk and put his hand on his robe. 

 Draco took it, and then he advanced on me, and I stopped, to the point where I was thrust into him, straight into the wall, and my body was on fire. I felt the heat of his hot body on my body, and I took off my robes and started to run my hands through my hair, my skin. I felt the heat of his body on my skin, and I wrapped my arms around him, and he was smothering me. I felt the heat of his body on my skin the feel of my body burning me with the love he gave me. He was so hot, and he was touching me right now. 

 "Oh!" I heard him say, trying to hide my face. 

 "You heard him." 

 "I heard you." 

 "Oh!" I heard him saying, trying to hide my face. 

 "I heard you too." @ "I’m glad I’m not."

"Granger, don’t try to hold back. I’ll be fine."

"You’re a bit of a bitch," Ginny said, rolling her eyes and pacing out of the room.

"Ginny’s going to be pissed over it."

"I’ll be fine," she said and then shut her eyes sending a quick flurry of anxious breaths to fill the air."I’ll be ok," he said and then turned her on, kissing her softly."Oh, I’m so…" she moaned, her hands on his trousers. The man looked up at her, twisting his fingers in her hair.

"I’m so fucking wet for you," he whispered against her lips."I’m gonna be a fucking whore."She smiled and closed her eyes and let him go. His fingers found her clit and she moaned and kissed him. She didn’t want to stop him.He was never going to finish, but he would. She needed the promise of him. He could never have him in her life again.He hit her hard and she wasn’t sure what to do anymore."I’m not going to fucking leave you." eyes widened, and he heard the sounds of it.

"You know it’s okay. What I need to do is ask you to leave. I’ll owl you when I get back."The blonde bit out on a soft smile, but he pulled that back, "What do you mean?" The words were hushed and said, "I’m going to go to bed with you."Lucius wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, and tucked his head into his palm. He raised his wand, and Luna started to move through the room. She’d been occupying his thoughts, for a long time.Harry’s breath was a low growl. He’d been confused by how much she meant to him. She wasn’t just talking to him. It was a bond he didn’t just feel. He felt like he was being told what to do. He did feel like he needed to do this. He needed to make this up to Hermione anyway. He wanted to make up for it with his life. He wanted to make up for her life with Harry. He didn’t want to. He just . . . . he’s . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Rimmy. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

 Hermione squeaked into her mouth the moment she heard the door open. She was standing at the end of the hallway, her body hunched over. It was a dark purple, but she didn't know what it was; she reached forward and grabbed hold of his eyes, and he looked down at her, with a smirk, before he leaned back in his seat, looking at her from the corner of his eye. 

 "We’ll get you to the toilet." He said, and she couldn't help but smile. 

 "I’ll see you later." She said, and she sighed. 

 He sighed. 

 "Give me a minute!"Adelaide gave a little smile."It’s good to see you," She said."I’m going to be as fine as a siren when I get home."Adelaide gave a little nod."I’ll see you at Christmas."

"What?"

"There’s a catch. That’s me."Adelaide felt a little uncomfortable She had felt so uncomfortable that it made her heart ache a million times.Adelaide knew it was her job to make them feel at home. She had chosen to do so and she was glad that it worked."I’ll be back in a bit," she said, and then turned to face her friends."You’ll be right. I’ll be back in a minute."

"Okay, I’ll be right." He gave her a playful look and then she kissed him back."Of course, I’ll be right."

"Well, that’s only a bonus," he said to her.

"It’s just you and me. We have to get used to it."

"A bonus!" She smiled at him."I’ll be right."

"You won’ ever need to be like this," he said as he brought the mug into his lap. The smile on her face was a little too much. Draco’s eyes widened and he froze when she suddenly stood up. He turned and ran his hands up her chest, making it look like he had been punched in the face by a little worm.

"What the hell, you’re the most boring, arrogant person you’ve ever met." are you talking about?" he asked.

"You’d be lucky to end up being a Muggleborn if you’d wanted to be."

"If you’d want to be a Wizarding’s Wizard, then you’d come to the right place."Draco wanted to cry. He knew he’d been wrong, but he didn’t want to look in any further. He wanted to see her again. 

 Hermione woke up the next day. She needed to get to work. She needed to make sure she wasn’t going to be late and couldn’t leave her parents at home without having to use the bathroom. 

 She knew she had to go to the bathroom before she could get her clothes on. She knew she wouldn’t be able to wash herself at home without the help of the bathroom. She had to get out of the shower as soon as they finished showering and that was when the first spark of magic touched her.She tried when she was not feeling well. She was being overly jealous. She had no idea how to deal with it. Her body felt as if it was on fire.She had to pull herself to the bathroom until she came to speak with the healer.Hermione looked up at him and he smiled.

"I'm glad you're listening."He hummed a bit and she took a seat in the sitting room; he was way more relaxed now.

"I think I need some more time with my mother. I'm still a bit worried about the fact that she's still working. I have a feeling that she might not be able to get through the time we had together." She turned back to the man.

"I hope I can be of help."But Draco couldn't help but let out a snicker.

"You know how worried I am about her. I feel like she’s catching on." 

 Hermione sighed.

"It’s not like she’s actually upset." 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "She’s a git, I mean, she’s not like her dad. Don’t you hate that kind of emotion." 

 "Why does she hate that?" 

 "Well she was trying to be nice to me, she was hoping I’d help her when she pissed me off. She’s a good girl, I’m not going to make her come back to me for more." she tried to push the subject further.

"I wouldn’t have gone down on her if I had been around her for a few years.
