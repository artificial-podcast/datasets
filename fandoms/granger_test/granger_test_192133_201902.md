He slid his tongue down the front of her panties and slid his hand back up her thigh. She was whimpering, and when he pulled his hand back, she knew he was plunging down. He had come so quickly, that she could feel pleasure from it, even through her underwear. He was so soft, so soft. He loved every inch of her. She pushed herself back against him, and she felt him grow to her. His fingers were on her hips, and she carried him to her mouth. She was staring at him remembering how his skin was hard. She felt his eyes on her face and she didn’t have time to think about it. She shook her head gently and closed her eyes. He pushed her against him and kissed her softly. 

 He’d never kissed her before. 

 She couldn’t help the blush that took over her cheeks when he kissed her. She was so red. 

 It was as if the emotions were making him feel like a fool. 

 "I was kinda embarrassed about it, okay?" She said, smiling. 

 "Yeah. Fine, I guess. Just don’t think about it too much." 

 "I’m sorry," She said, and she looked back at her drinks and down at the empty bottle. 

 "I’m sorry, I’m sorry." She said sincerely, and her eyes were wide with the tears in her eyes. 

 "I’m sorry, Hermione. I’m sorry. I need you to understand that you’re still here and you’re not going to get it. I’m not going to let anyone else get hurt." Theo said, and Draco was pretty sure he heard her words. 

 "I’ll do whatever you want to do to make this right. 

 "I do," She said, giving him a smile and a nod that made him smile back.

"I’ll get out of here." 

 He smiled at her, but he could see her face contorting in anticipation of what she was about to say.

"I’m getting out of here." 

 "You’re so–" 

 For a moment Harry thought he was losing his mind, followed by a soft chuckle."Yes, I am. I’m sorry, Harry."

"I’m sorry, but I’m sorry. I don’t know how to respond."

"Don’t worry, Harry. I’ll try not to be so dramatic."

"That’s right, Harry. I just have to make sure you’re OK." see," Theo said, giving her hand a little squeeze.

"I’m just trying to make sure you’re okay."

"I’m fine," Harry said dryly and kissed her forehead. Theo said that the two of them had been together for months now and he thought that maybe it was too soon."Actually, I don’t know what you two are talking about."

"You two don’t."

"I heard they told me what they did for me."

"I don’t know."

"I don’t know."

"I’ve only been here for a couple of years now. I’m not sure if I’m doing the right thing or not."

"I don’t want to change the world. I don’t want to." She shook her head and inhaled deeply.

"I can’t. And I have to be really honest. I have to make sure at least I have a job." She looked up at him, side-on.

"We need to figure out a way to keep certain people safe. Especially those who are here at the moment."He swallowed.

"I don’t know. But, I do know we’re going to have a little bit of a fight about it until we get the fuck out of here."She shook her head.

"I don’t know what to do."

"I’m sorry," he said, brushing her hair away from his face.

"I’ll be good for you."

"Okay."He stepped back, looking down at her.

"You’re a bloody big deal Hermione. Muggleborn."

"You’re so beautiful," she said, looking at him. He nodded."You should go and fuck yourself," he said, a nervous breath escaping her lips.He kissed her mouth, letting his hand caress her neck. He’d never felt this way before."That’s what I want."She sucked in a breath. She wanted him to feel her cunt, the sensation of his cock pressing against her."Oh Merlin."There was a long silence."Oh…"His hands came up her skirt. He grabbed her by the shoulders and held her in place. She didn’t have time to react, so she let her head fall back down to his lap. A few moments later, he grabbed her hips and lifted her up. She let her head fall back onto his lap, her hands cupped between his hot wet skin."I’m sorry to have to feel the way I do, but I am sorry to have to feel like this little witch." Hermione softly sniffs, her hands moving to cup his cock. He kisses her mouth with his teeth, the heat radiating from her body."It’s you, my little sweetheart." Hermione’s voice is warm, her voice smooth, her hands gripping his shoulders and pulling him into a tight hug. She whispered in his ear, her heart racing as she held her breath.He kissed her forehead, her skin moistening and her tongue pulling him closer, the fingers running along her leg. He kissed her back, relishing the feel of her soft skin against his, and the way her skin was warm against his. His hands found her hips, trailing down her body, her hands finding where his hips had found his mouth. He pulled her hips up against his with a firm grip. He rested his hands on her hips, sucking on her cunt as she shuddered. She cried out and pulled him closer. 

 He kissed her again, letting his body feel her. She cried out again, and he wrapped his fingers around her end, allowing his body to feel her. He started to pull her hips up towards his chest, and find her. 

 She knew he was planning on doing this, but she couldn't keep her mouth shut. She moaned loudly.

"Oh god, I can feel your cum pouring in my mouth!"

"No, no, no, no, no!" she screamed, her words bouncing off the table. She was so wet and needy, and Ron had to stop himself from moving."Hermione…" he heard her scream.

"I’m going to have to stop!"

"No, no you don’t," she said with a laugh.

"I already said I’m going to stop!"

"You’re right, I don’t want to," he said as she pulled her out of her chair, "but I’m not going to listen to you."

"Oh, I’m sorry," she said really quickly.

"I’ll return to my office later. You have to go." please don’t worry," Harry said softly and leaned back against the wall.

"I’ll come back to my office soon." He said, and then turned back to Hermione.

"I’ll be back in a minute." He said, and then turned back to Ron.

"Stupid thing to bother you with." Ron said, knowing Ron would hate it.

"Give me a minute."

"Yes," Ginny said, with a smile.

"I’m going to have to finish a little."

"Harry," Ginny said with a smile.

"Why was he on the train?"

"Well, I’ll be fine. He’s a big man."

"You’re right, he was on the train," Hermione said, and Ron smiled guilt at her."I did," Ron said, stroking her hair while Hermione’s hand rested on his side.

"I was so nervous. I’ll never forget."

"No!" Hermione gasped, eyes wide as she looked at him."What happened?" she asked, still looking at him exasperated.

"I don’t know."

"You can’t," he said, looking at her as though she was on fire.

"You have to go."Hermione looked at him closely, a cracked smirk on her lips.

"Not for me to tell you it’s fine, but I’m here to help you."

"I’m not," he said, "I’m here to help you."

"I’ll be right back. closed his eyes and glanced at the clock on the wall."Oh," he said, relieved.

"I’m going to go get out of here."

"I’ll be right back."He slipped out of the room. He called for his cell phone and started to pace on it. He heard it ring.He needed to get out of here, he needed to get out of here. He needed to get out.He knew it wasn't just his hair. It was all tangled in her hair. He knew it was fun to do, but it was also dangerous. He wanted to make them both happy, but he didn't want to hurt them. He wanted to make them both happy.He needed to find a way to get out of this. He needed to find a way to make a difference.A while passed in silence as he thought. He was certain there was nothing to be said. He had to get it over with."I have to know," he said softly, "and I have to be done with this."Draco felt his stomach churn."I’m sorry," he said, standing up and placing a hand on her shoulder.

"I’m sorry."

"I’m sorry."

"I’m sorry," she said, shaking her head.

" sorry, I’m just trying to be honest with you. If you’ve been ‘all messed up’ as I said, you’re going to have to learn to deal with it."She could see the anger and sadness in her eyes, and she didn’t want to hurt anyone.

"I don’t know how to deal with it."

"You didn’t say you didn go. Why don’t you?"

"Well, I wanted to be sure that I didn’t go. I wasn’t really looking forward to it."

"I know you’re getting more and more upset with me," she complained. He didn’t know how to react."What do you mean?"

"I mean, I don’t know how to deal with it if I keep pretending to like it or not," he said, trying to keep it in the back of his mind.

"I hope Hermione’s going to be okay with that."

"You’re going to love her the whole way!" Ron bellowed, pushing the table back and taking the seat and chair."She’s going to love you!" Hermione said, throwing her arms up in surrender.

"You’ my best friend."Draco smirked at her.

"Bored of the idea of you?" he said, his voice low and quiet. No one else had heard of her.

"I’m not a witch, but I want to hear you say it."Her stomach twisted at the thought of her boyfriend watching her and ignoring his pleas for her to meet up with him, but she fought the urge to keep her mouth shut.

" Potter."Draco turned the topic of sex to Draco’s side.

"He’s very attractive. He’s a very rich man."

"I’ll take that as an argument."Theo began to speak.

"But I can’t help but feel that there’s a betrayal in this. The rising resentment of him."Draco was suddenly staring at him as though he was being watched. He was silent for a long moment."I don’t want to talk about it," he said, and Malfoy’s eyes softened."Don’t worry about it," he said, making a face.

"I want to talk about something that’s happened to me."The look that made him want to punch his pants in the air stared him in the eyes."I don’ want to have to deal with you," he said, "but I have to."She searched his eyes for a second before she sighed, "This is not a lot, I know you’re not a virgin."He sighed, "I thought I was supposed to be a virgin."She glanced at him, hands on her hips.

"You’re not. You’re a witch."He didn say it.

"You don’t have one."She wrapped her arms around him and slid the back of her neck into his hands. He pressed himself into her, trying to push at her neck, refusing to let her go."I-I have to—"

"What? What are you doing?" he cut her off, his eyes hard as they landed on hers."I just want to fuck you." looked up at him, her eyes flickering to him."I’m your fucking girlfriend, Granger." Hermione mumbled against his chest, the look in her eyes causing him to laugh."You want me to fuck you?" He grinned, stopping in his tracks to see her.Hermione’s eyes widened in surprise."I know. I know." He said with a laugh, and then turned to kneel before her.

"We need to get married." 

 The moment they entered the room, she was aghast. The way she looked at him. The way he looked at her. The way she looked at him. He hated that he was her. He had loved her for so long he wanted to forget it. 

 He started to run his hands through his hair, trying to paint a picture of her. 

 The fact that she loved him, the way he touched her, and the way he spoke to her, and the way he felt, and knew she was, made her more than happy to share everything. 

 "I’m sorry." She closed her eyes and lifted her chin out into the air, "I’m sorry." 

 "You were a good girl, Hermione." 

 "I wasn’t." 

 "I’m sorry, she said."Your mother was a great witch."

"No. She was not."

"I’m sorry," she said without looking back."I’m sorry," he said.

"How can I tell?"

"I don’t want to hurt you." 

 The first thing to notice is the set of hair and clothes Hermione’s hair was in, making her feel a bit uncomfortable. And then she found herself spotting the quilt. It was a black, simple set of clothes that made her look like a teenager."You’re not here now."

"Sorry, I’m not here now."

"I’ll see you later."She preferred to sit on her bed and wait for her next opportunity. She could see the secondary window that showed the town she was in, all of it was almost empty."I'm sorry, Potter." She said softly, looking down at her watch, "It's been seven days." She said, with a frown on her face, "I had a nightmare." She said softly, "It's not Christmas time." She said with a small smile.

"I'm sure you can get back in time for Christmas." She said with a smile."I'm sure it won't be that bad," He said softly, his fingers tapping her arm She let out a little gasp, looking at him with a small smile. 

 Hermione screwed up her nose and nodded, looking at him with a laugh.

"Yeah. I'm gonna do it." She said as she took a deep breath. 

 He watched her for a moment, watching her face and his expression.

"I don't know what happened." He said quietly, shaking his head.

"I'm not sure. I mean, I'm a little suspicious. But I don't want to see the man I have to see with that type of maniac. I mean, I know he's a big prick, but I just don't know how to deal with him."He looked at her, a little shocked.

"You know you're a prick, aren't you?"She rolled her eyes.

"Yes, I did. But, I did know he was a big prick, and I don't want to see him with that type of maniac."He sighed.

"Yeah, I guess. But, he was a good friend to me."

"He is more than a friend."

"He was a good friend to me. I know he's a good friend to me. I'm a good friend to him, yes."

"He's not a friend."

"He's not a friend of mine. I never would have guessed. He's a good friend to me. I'm glad he's with me.
