Hermione stood in the middle of the street, looking out upon the couple in the doorway.

"You've got to get out of your parents' club."Her eyes snapped open and a smirk pulled at her lips.

"Are you going to let the Wizengamot shut me up?"

"Of course." She crossed her arms, looking at Hermione with a tight smile.

"I told you it would be alright to be mad at the Wizengamot."The look of shock was more than Hermione could've imagined."I'm sorry," she said.

"I'm just—I'm not the perfect woman to be in the world." She knew she could have forgiven him even if he were her best friend. So she just stood there and waited for him to come in. He wouldn't come in."Draco," he whispered.Hermione shook her head and let a sob escape.

"I know. He's a good man. I know. He's a good man. He's a good man. You know I don't care what you're wearing. I'm just not comfortable with wearing my school uniform."Her lips quirked up in a vicious grin, and he couldn't help but feel the terror in her eyes.

"I'm just not sure I want to wear that."He turned to face her with a smirk.

"What are you doing?"

"I'm not going to come see you in public."

"You're not going to come see me in your private life."She held her breath and made him stop talking.

"I knew it, I know it. But I’m not a stupid girl."His eyes flicked to the door and she could see the fear in his eyes.

"I don’t know."He turned and walked out the door, his eyes focused on the door.

"Oh, shit!"He pushed the door open and her stomach arched up in pain.

"I don’t know if I’m capable of doing this anymore, but you’re not going to hurt me, Harry."

"I’m not going to hurt you," Harry said and bit his lip.

"After what I experienced, you know what I’ll do to you. I don’t want to hurt you again."It was a mild, directed argument, still, but he could feel it. Fingers crossed. But he wasn’t going to be so easily hurt.He allowed himself a moment to relax before looking at the man’s face, "He’s…" He looked at her with a frown, "I wonder what’s going on with him?"She looked at him, "I’d rather not."

"It’s not you…" Draco said, "It’s me, Granger."

"And I’m not the first to consider it. why?"

"Oh, I don’t know."

"Why do you think I like you?"

"Because I want you to feel good."

"Well, that’s why I’m still the fucking best at it. So why is this so important?"

"Is it to take you away from your father?"

"No. That’s not what I saying," she said, thinking about how badly it would hurt to have her father go and make him sick, and what it would mean for him.

"I’m just here, Hermione, and I want you to know that I’ll be there for you when the time comes." She told him as she pulled away and looked at him.

"I’ll be there when you get there, too," he told her.
