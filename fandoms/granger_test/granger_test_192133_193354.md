She tasted of pudding, and was keen a bit salty. She obviously wasn't that hungry, but that wasn't the point. 

 "Sure," she said, though her tone was still raw and uncharacteristic.

"I'm sure I'm not too hungry for my own good." 

 "I'll have to eat more than that," she said, though she felt like a little girl had just given birth. She had to be able to eat before she was seventeen, and she had a lot of time to process things. It was quite an adventure for her to go through, and yet, she felt like it. So with a little help from the others, she managed to get herself acquainted with the people she would be meeting.After about a half hour of conversing, she was approached by a man named Gus, who was also in Azkaban, and a man named Draco. He took a seat on the couch outside of the guardhouse. He sat it down on the side of the bed and waited for them to continue. The guards were waiting and waiting until the three of them reached the doors to the elf's quarters. Hermione’s arms were delicately tied behind her back and Ron shuffled forward to straddle her lap.

"Ron?" Hermione asked, her voice stony.

"Yes, Ron?"

"Well, this is Lucius, the elf."

"Yes, sir. I refuse to let you be anywhere near him."

"I see." She whispered, and the man relaxed on the floor.

"Now, where are you going?"

"I am going to have dinner with my dear father and Hermione. I am going to have a little chat with my dear mother and Ginny." A light breeze blew over the open windows of the house.

"I have heard that you are looking for a house elf come along and get the fuck out of here." He pulled the door closed and spoke to the elf. 

 The elf sighed, "I shall oblige you." 

 "I’ll get you a home elf," The elf said with a low voice, "I heard you." 

 "I know you’re not going to go home." 

 "No, but I be right back. Ready to make the choice that will pay for the extra miles."

"No, you’re going to have to do that."

"Okay, I’ll just head back to bed." She did manage to sneak a sip of water and then puffed out her cheeks with a sigh.

"Hermione, when we’re ready," she said with a smile."Yes, I’ sure you’ll be right where you’re going." She turned her head to face Draco.

"And we’ll do it right here, right right now."

"I’m not going to wait around for you to show up," Draco said, looking at her.

"What do you mean, you won’t show up when you’re ready?"

"No, of course not! he said with a small laugh.

"I’m a Weasley."Hermione gave him a sad smile and then said, "But I’m not ready for you!"

"Stop that! You’re too smart to be invisible!" Ron said sharply. She watched him as he walked away from her.

"You’re really not going to hide your excitement for me?"

"Ah, I not that excited," Harry said, sitting up straighter.

"I’ll tell you when you get back."

"Very well." He pressed Draco’s lips up against hers, his low, commanding voice.

"I’ll be back by noon."

"Just a few minutes." Draco looked away from Harry and Draco told him to go to bed. The guest bedroom was larger than the guest room, and they had both been given a bed of their own.Draco and Harry were both sitting on the bed and Draco was curled up in his arms. Harry was curled up next to them, and Draco was straddling Draco's shoulders.Harry sat on Draco's shoulder and kissed him softly.

"I need to see you."Draco's eyes were filled with tears, "I'm not going to change it." He paused and drew back, cupping Harry's cheek.

"I'm going to find out what you'll be working with and how you're going to destroy it."Astoria let out a long sigh and let her eyes fall shut.

"Well, you'll find out soon enough. I'll be back later. I'm counting on it."Hermione sat up and took a seat on the couch, her legs wrapped around her hips. She was eager to get this over with but her heart was racing. A part of her was starting to feel like someone had finally paid for both sides in this war. She wanted to see the girl who had been so loyal to Voldemort and who had been so loyal to Harry that he had never truly forgiven her. And? What happened?Why had Voldemort allowed her to stay? In the end, her own father had been given the job. She knew she would be there for Voldemort.The Dark Lord's personal trainer. She knew the man would be there. He had also been present for the first night of class. It felt like he was getting to be a part of the class.Lily and Ron were both on their way to the library and Ginny was looking at Harry who was sitting at the table with Lily, Ginny, and Neville.Dobby was sitting in the back of the room talking about the book he had seen in the library. He had seen the book he had bought for Harry. The book he had bought for Harry. The book that Hermione had bought for him. The book that he had bought for her. The one he knew so well. The one she had been carrying with her in her dormitory. The one he had been to check on her. He had stopped taking the Dark Mark as a child and decided to be a Death Eater. He had grown so close to her that he thought that perhaps he was as close as she was.Hermione had actually done something to her with the Dark Mark, but he really didn't know how to explain. He wanted to know if he could do it right? How did he do it? How did you do it? He thought he could do it in his head. He’d been thinking it over for hours to get to this point. He knew he had to do it. But he couldn’t. He wanted to get to this point. He wanted to fuck the shit out of her. He wanted to get to this point. He’d fuck this shit out of her and he’d fuck this bitch for fucking eternity. So he’ll get her out of this fucking house!" He’d say. 

 "Yeah, he’s infuriating, you know?" Hermione said, catching his eye. 

 "Yeah, I’m good," Ron added. 

 "He’s going to get her out of this fucking house," Hermione said, looking at the door with a frown. 

 "I’m going to have to get out of here." He said, looking at her. 

 "What?" She asked, looking at him with a frown. 

 "Hermione, I’m sorry, I didn’t want to upset you. I’m just…I just haven’t…I can’t…" He said, looking at her, this anger creating a flash in his eye. She’d felt her skin tensing, even as he’d tried to fix it. 

 "I’m sorry, love," She said soothingly.

"I don’t want to hurt you…" 

 He started to walk out, leaving both of them in the empty common room. Hermione was worried that he’d just left his mark on her. He’d never have been more beautiful, so how was she to miss him?"I’ll be happy tonight," He said, looking around the room.

"I’m sure you’re going to be very happy." She turned around, looking around to make sure all of them were watching.

"I’d best go."

"Right." Ginny said, eyeing the audience.

"Wait, you’re going to be quiet for a moment, I’m sure."

"You’re going to be quiet?"

"Yes, I’ll be quiet!" Ginny cried, looking furious.

"I’m sorry, I’d hate to hear that!"

"You’re going to be quiet, too." Ginny said, a little too much in a whisper.

"And you’re going to be arrested for various crimes." 

 "I’ll be in the middle of the street and I swear to you." She smirked, "and you’ll be arrested for these crimes." 

 "I’ll be in their fucking park." He pulled his wand out and held it out to her. 

 "You don’t have to worry about me, I’ll be right back." 

 "I’ll be back." 

 "I’ll be right back." 

 "You’re right." 

 "I’m happy." 

 "I’m happy." 

 "Wow." 

 "Wow." 

 "You are so happy." 

 "I really am." 

 Today, boys and girls finally got together for the first time since the War. I had been so happy to be here and all I wanted to do was be with my family. It was a pretty big event and I want to thank everyone who supported me. I really do love you guys. 

 "Hermione." He said, looking at her with a smile on his face. 

 "Oh." She said, looking up at him.He got up and said, "What do you want to do?"

"Well, we can go to Hogsmeade to meet the Aurors and then we can head to the dungeons to set things up and let everyone know what we can do." She said, looking down at her bag and trying to remember to have a drink.He sighed, turning away for a moment and saying, "Yeah, it's funny that we’ had a movie together, but it’s getting back to me." 

 "That’s brilliant!" his father smiled, "it’s one of my favorite movies I’ve ever seen." 

 Draco watched as his father and his mother exchanged a small smile and said, "You’re such a sweet person!" 

 "Yes, I think so," Draco said, smiling at the pretty girl who was staring at him.

"I’m sorry, it’s weird, and you’re right, we are sort of flirtatious now, Draco."

"Um, yeah—"

"It’s true." She grinned at him.

"I’m up for a date!"She nodded and Pansy gave him a wink, and he rolled his eyes.  can do this, Ron," Ginny said, almost teasing him. The twins smiled and Ron rolled his eyes. He liked her. He could tell she was the type to be around him like this, and he couldn’t deny it. He couldn’t resist showing her around with such a brilliant personality. Though, he knew that it would be a bit hard to do. It was a bit more difficult, as he knew that was their only way to do it. he set his large glass of water down and placed it on the table.Laying his hand on the table, his mouth parted open in surprise. Dahlia had already taken her glass of water. He raised an eyebrow.

"Oh…So you're telling me you were able to obtain the antidote?" She asked with a raised eyebrow. He nodded.

"Is there a difference?"

"Yeah…I've got a couple of Quidditch teams in the stands, so I can do the same thing." James said.Everyone nodded and took a moment to appreciate the man’s work and then both of them exited the room."He’s been doing it for a while, is he not?" Pansy asked, standing up and looking down the hallway."Yeah, he’s been doing it for a while now." James said."So, what’s his name?" Pansy asked."Mr. Malfoy." James said, leaning over and joining Sirius in the doorway."Malfoy?" he asked, sounding too serious to be serious.James grinned at her.

"Hello." He said, he’d gotten Draco to help him up with the pills. The way he’d waited to see if Draco had been able to get them at the hospital, the way he’d been there, Harry feet practically rode up on the backs of his legs. He would try to pull those legs apart, but it would take several tries. So, he ran, and he ran even harder. With each step he took, the pain in his back increased. This time he was determined to go faster. 

 Harry realized he was doing a good job at keeping himself going, but he was worried that he might take a beating, too. He wanted to finish, but he knew he would never be able to. 

 But he knew he had to change. 

 And so he did. 

 Because she’s not dead. 

 She’s dead. 

 They both know that. 

 "Ginny’s a terrible liar." 

 "What’s wrong with you?" 

 "I don’t know. We’re both women." 

 " a woman. You know how to talk to women?" 

 "I know, but…" Hermione whispered, looking away as she looked up at the ceiling.

"I’m sure I’m a little arrogant if you think I’m a little arrogant." She took a deep breath, trying to stop her tears from escaping her eyes.

"You know how to talk to women?" 

 " Ginny turned to her left, followed by "You know how to talk to women?"Hermione didn’t know what to say, just smiled. She was in the middle of the lake and listened to the water.

"Um…and I’ll make sure to call it that," Hermione said, trying to feel the water.She knew it was wrong, but had to admit she was proud of herself."I’m going to go ahead and kiss you." She said and turned to him.

"Silencio." He said and Hermione rolled her eyes.They were silent for a while. Theo and Pansy looked at him. When they finished, Theo took a seat beside them and Hermione sat down next to him. She was sitting at her desk, hands on her hips, and Theo was sitting beside her. The two of them were staring at each other. Theo said, "Sorry, you’re going to be the first one to say you’re sorry." Harry looked at her suspiciously, "I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry." 

 "Hermione, I don’t know what to say," Draco said, looking at her.

"I’m sorry." She nodded in agreement.

"I’ve never done anything like that," She said, and with that, she turned and turned back to his side.

"It’s not that I’m not scared of the Dark Lord. It’s just that…I just…" She muttered under her breath. 

 He pulled in a deep breath.

"I need to go." He said, and she nodded, though she didn’t want to follow in his thoughts. He kissed her forehead, and she moaned softly as he pressed his lips into her. He sucked on her neck until she got a tight curve, and then she moved forward in his mouth, her lips wet against his."Fuck!" he groaned, and she thrusted into him, her hands finding their way into his pockets.

"You’re so wet, Granger."She sucked on his neck harder, and his legs grew stronger, and he thrust into her again. His thrusting pleasure brought her orgasm and brought her climax, and he kept pulling, but a few more moments went by, and she couldn’t stop herself from letting out her own orgasm."God, I’m so close," he breathed, his hands cupping her breasts.

"I’m so close to fucking her," he repeated, his eyes half-closed.
