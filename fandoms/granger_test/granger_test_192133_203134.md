The words sent a shudder through his body, his heart pounding. 

 "Right." 

 "Right." 

 "I’ll be right back." 

 He took a deep breath, but his heart was pounding harder. 

 "I love you, Ron." 

 Ron shook his head, shaking his head. 

 "No, I don’t." 

 "I don’t love you, Mr. Greengrass. He’s a very brave man, but he’s also a liar, and you know that, Mr. Greengrass. I’m sorry I didn’t catch that," he said, running his hands through his hair.

"I need to get out of here. I’m so sorry, Mr. Greengrass." Lucius nodded at his friend. He turned to leave, but Ron could hear the clacking of footsteps behind him. It was Dumbledore. 

 "Hello," the man said. 

 "We’re here to welcome you," Dumbledore said, starting to walk away. 

 "You see," Dumbledore said, and he moved again. 

 "I’m sorry," Ron said, feeling a bit of shame for his behaviour. 

 "I would’ve thought someone would have seen him making fun of me."

"Are you sure you’re not a coward?" She took a step back.

"You’ve been a coward too long."

"I’m sorry I let him get away with it." She said.

"I hope I’m not going to ruin it for you."

"I’d rather not be a coward," he said, turning to face her." I’ll be a strong one," she said.

"I’ll be there." 

 "Oh," Draco said, looking at her with a grin.

"So it’s true!" she said, pulling her hair from her face."Mmm," he said, pulling back just enough to get her attention.

"I’ll take the piss until I get her attention."

"How many times have you been in there?"

"A little over ten," Harry said, staring at the bed and looking at the ceiling.

"Just because you want attention doesn’t mean I’m going to let you get it."

"Quite." The door swung open and Harry was already sitting on it.

"Well, maybe the rest of us aren’t as full of shit as you are." 

 "It’s not that I think you’re just as fucked out as you are," Ron said, his voice quiet, but not that much. 

 "I think something else has something to do with it." 

 "I’m not sure I can say for sure," Ron said, his voice still tense. 

 "What do you mean?" @ "I mean, I’m not sure."

"I don’t know what I’m going to do with you," Gus said, adjusting the lashes.

"I’m not your mate." He pulled a face, and then crossed his arms out over his face, curled up into a tight fist, faced forward.

"I’m not sure what I’m going to do." The anger that had been growing in her eyes now carried over rapidly, and she wanted to apologize for it. 

 "It is always my responsibility to have a good name," Draco said, looking at her with a frown.

"I don’t understand why you’re so afraid to speak up, when you’ve already broken my heart." 

 "And that’s why I’m here." 

 " went to school with her, so I can tell you that it’s not just my life." She said with a small smile as the door swung open. Concentration. Another minute or so of this was just enough to send her excited. She felt her chest curving up into a fist, and her head bobbing a little to encourage more of her attention.

"I need you. I need you. He smiled and kissed her on the mouth.He walked into the doorway and pulled out a book, the light crackling with the scent of blood. He leaned over and kissed her lips, licking the silk of her hair before pressing his lips over hers. He kissed her back, slowly opening the book and reading.She sucked on it and felt the wetness of his lips against hers. She could feel the heat of his mouth against hers. She spun around and looked down at him. He was far too tall.

"I think I’ll start," He said, looking down.It was awkward, but as she spun around in his arms, he said, "I’ll start at the Gryffindor Tower."Hermione climbed in on him and kissed his cheek. He kissed her back, and then she had to stop.

"I’ll stop." She leaned her head to his chest, and he looked up at her with a resigned look. His eyes were glassy and he seemed to have lost his focus.

"I-I'll go and finish making the tea." He pulled the open door to the corner and in the next instant, she’d adopted a swish of her wand as she shoved her cart into the hallway.

"You’re awake!" He glanced down at an arm-chair in front of his work.

"After all, I’d hate to leave his…" He glanced down at his work. He was wearing a grey suit, with a matching black tie.

"It’s a bit of a stand-in then."Ron looked up at him with a slight smile.

"Yeah, I’ll be sure to let you know if you need anything."

"Good," he said, a chuckle."Good, she said, smiling at him."I’m glad for that."

"What about you?"

"After the first weekend?"

"Oh," he said.

"I’m so sorry, Hermione."

"I’m not sorry that much," she said, her voice still low. He smiled at her as he took a seat at the table. He had a feeling that she was going to be there. Gideon rounded on her, a bit concerned.

"Would you like to join me?" He asked, and she nodded.

"I’d like to." She said, turning to him.

"Yeah, I’ll be in the office at four." He said, and Hermione nodded.

"I’ll be in the office at four." She said, and then turned and headed for the door.Sirius turned and said, "Granger, you can get in there."He stared at her, shocked that she had been so disrespectful. He then looked at her, his eyes searching for something."Sorry about that."Hermione smirked and then said, "Hey, I’ll be right out with you."

"I’ve got a surprise for you," Sirius said with a chuckle.

"One that will be your birthday present."

"I’m gonna be late," she said, rolling her eyes.

"So, what’s up?"He stalked to her and pulled her into a warm embrace, pulling her into a kiss."Good to see you," she said, giving him a tight hug.

"Thank you, Sirius."

"You’re the only one who’d ever asked for it," Remus said, looking tired and worried as he watched Harry."It’s not like you’ve had a heart attack," Sirius said, standing up and putting a hand on Harry’s shoulder. He felt Remus’ hand on his shoulder, and suddenly he felt like he’d never felt anything like this in his life. He’d been so fucking excited to see her and not only did she want to be his girlfriend, but she’d also wanted to be with him. She’d been so happy, for the first time in her life. He didn’t know what to make of that. He’d been lying to her all night and she was worried about her. And if he didn’t tell her, she’d go and ask for an explanation. He’d smile and nod, his heart hammering in his chest."What do you mean?" he enquired."I mean, he said 'they’re all dead'’, but I think I’m just saying…" Harry said, looking at her."I’m not going to mind if you tell me what he’s going on about."

"He’s got a huge ego," Malfoy said, "but he’s a good boy."

"That’s not true."

"He’s a lot better than that," Draco said, trying not to smile at the entire conversation.

"He’s way more powerful than people think."

"Pansy isn’t going to let you down," Draco said.

"You know, I’ve known Ginny for years. She’s never been close to you yet, and I had no idea that you’d get a new girlfriend." Ginny’s eyes widened as she said this."I told you it would be wrong to tell me this!" Draco cried, his voice deep and firm.

"I know you’re not going to tell me this, but I want to help you. I just wanted to give you something to feel comfortable about. You’re not as good in your hair as I am, but I know how you feel about it. If you really want to go out and get a drink, I can help you do it." 

 "Wanna be like all of us?" his father asked, looking at her with a huge smile.

"You’re driving me crazy." 

 "Yeah, I’m sorry." 

 "You’re not, when I’m asleep." I hear her’s voice, as if I’m already close to hearing her again, as if I don’t know her. She’s obviously whispering.

"I’m sorry." She says it out loud, while I hear her.

"I’m sorry I’ve hurt you. You don’t have to." She’s asking me to not leave."You’ll never hurt a fucking fucking person, love." I roll my eyes at her, only to realize that she knows exactly what I’m doing. The words hit her like a bushel of bricks."You’re a fucking liar." She shoves her hand into her mouth, pulling me away from her. The first thing I’ve done to her, it’s gotten my blood boiling, knowing she going to end up as a full-blown alcoholic. I’m not going to let her down, I’m not going to let her down."

"I don’t want her to end up like that, I’ll give her the best opinion, but you’re not going to hurt her."

"I’ll give her the best opinion, and I love her," Narcissa said, walking behind the two of you."Oh, you have my attention," Harry said, grinning."My-"Draco turned his back on Narcissa.

"You can’t just keep it all on the table and tell her you’re the best guy for her," he said, looking utterly surprised.

"You’ve got me, Harry."

"Who’s the best guy?" Draco asked trying to keep his tone nonchalant. He didn’t know how to answer, afraid of offending his best friend."I’m Ravenclaw," Harry said.

"So, I’ll be the best."

"You’ll be alright," Draco said, giving a pleased chuckle.

"But, I’m not here to sit around and gossip."

"Oh, I haven’ nodded, "I’ll go check on her tomorrow."Hermione stayed frozen, waiting for his answer.

"I’ll be ready."Draco took a deep breath, his fingers brushing against her skin.

"I’ll see you tomorrow, Draco."

"Thanks."She wrenched herself from his touch, pulling him from her thoughts.

"You’re my best friend. I love you." 

 "We’re going to be okay, Hermione. You’re safe," Draco said, leaning into her. 

 "I’m sure it’s okay, too." 

 "We’ll always be together, Hermione." 

 "Let’s sleep." 

 Draco had his stomach churning with the thought of going on the run. His name was pronounced more like ‘M’ and he had his right hand in his trousers; as if he wasn’t going to change. Even though he had his arm around the blonde’s waist, he wasn’t going to admit to himself that he was a virgin.

"Well, I’ll be damned if I won’t, Draco," he said.

"I’m gonna go."

"I know," she said, her voice slightly lower than before.

"I’ll be fine."

"I don’t want to be serious," Draco said, he was still looking at her with a smirk.

"You’re welcome to the club."

"Thank you," she said, a smile forming on her face.

"I’ll see you later. I’m sure." Harry stepped back, and they both grinned at the girl only seconds apart.

"It was the best decision I’ve ever made," she said, smiling, "but you’re brilliant. You know," she added, "I’m the best in this world. I’m so lucky to have you."

"Lucius, I’ll be right back." He said, his face weird with fear.Harry stood and placed his arm around her shoulders. His eyes were focused on her. She stood up, her head in her hands and ran her fingers through her hair. He knew what she did to him. He knew how weak she was and how much she hurt him. 

 "I’m sorry, love, it’s okay." She said softly, her hands clasped together. see." He said, his voice soft and gentle.

"I’m sorry, love, I’ll fix it."She breathed out a sigh of relief, feeling like she’d been suffocated. There was no way in hell she’d been in pain."He’s going to fix it." She said, trying to let her voice come out as though she’d been in the same place for the last seven years."Is this your home?" he asked, tapping her on the shoulder with his wand. She’d been pulling up a sheet of parchment as though it’s been held there for the last seven years.

"I’m going to take it down and make sure things don’t go to hell."Hermione sighed, trying to calm herself."Okay," he said, looking at her with a knowing look.

"I’ll try to persuade you to take the class again."She nodded slowly.

"I’m not going to do that, and I know you’ll be a lot better off if I do."He looked frustrated.

"You know I’m going to win."She looked away and then into his eyes. She had to keep thinking of this moment."I know you’ve had a rough week," he said, looking at her with a smirk on his face.

"I heard it in the papers, in the Ministry, and... it’s a joke." 

 "What?" she asked. 

 "Well, that’s the first thing that came to mind. I knew you weren’t going to be happy about it, but I didn’t want to let it get any worse."

"It’s a good thing you’re a good witch," he said, looking around at the crowd.

"You’re not wearing your hair up."

"Oh, he's not going to take it off!"Hermione’s breath caught.

"Who does he think he is?"

"He’s not a witch," Ron said.  a woman.

"Is he?"Hermione looked at him, shocked.

"He’s not a witch," she said, "He’s a wizard, Ron."

"He’s a wizard. You’re not going to be able to place him in the same class as a wizard."

"Oh, he’s a wizard," Ron said, feeling his chest heat up and his back ache.

"And he’s not," he said, actually sounding annoyed, "but I’m going to have to tell him and Hermione about it."

"Oh, great," Ron said, looking back and forth between them.

"I’ll tell him and Hermione about it."

"Yeah, that’s cool," Hermione said, smiling a little as she turned her head to look at Draco."Not only that, but you’re in a new school for the first time."

"I’ll be in the class for a month." Draco said, looking around at the Gryffindor table."Okay, I’ll be in the class this summer." Hermione said, folding her arms over her chest."Happy birthday, Draco." Draco looked at her, a look that had her shaking her head. It wasn’t a nice look, but he had every word he had to say."Ginny Weasley’s expecting us!" Ginny yelled."I’m so happy," Draco said."You don’t have to apologize." Ginny said and nodded."Are you okay?" Draco asked, watching the two of them."Yes, I am I’ll just keep it to myself," Luna said, letting her arms wrap around Draco’s shoulders.

"I’m just not going to lie to you about anything."Hermione visibly relaxed.

"I’m not going to lie if you think I’m not ready to go in."

"I’m not right now," Draco countered.
