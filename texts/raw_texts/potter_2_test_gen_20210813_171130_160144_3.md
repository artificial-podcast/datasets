I cannot resist. I feel a strange urge and call within me to go where no man should take me."

Hermione was pulled back, her chest heaving with exertion. "I understand," she whispered against his

lips as the tension in their bond faded. They were alone on this Earth. Hermione had been taken for

granted by Tom. She had felt helpless at that time but now? Her own feelings of helplessness filled

him without question or hesitation; he had never once shown such vulnerability when he'd been trying

so hard not to act out of self-preservation. But what did it feel like to be loved after everything

they'd shared together? It wasn't just being hurt – it sounded different to Hermione. There would

always have stills and moments when pain wouldn’t leave her, especially since she didnned the

uniform again during those very times. “You don—don see anything wrong here Malfoy…do you think we

need clothes?" He asked, a slow smile curling her lips. His eyes locked with hers. The way Draco's

eyes moved over them made hearing herself breathe more pleasant than he ever could have imagined,

but even then these days, most people couldn... Couldnly breathe normally if there weren' any

breathing room between them anymore. Her fingers curled into fists along one side clasped tightly

around Harry Potter who sat beside Neville Longbottom as though waiting. Harry was sitting next Ron

Weasley with Luna Lovegood leaning down to kiss his neck. Luna only got a few moments of that,

before she leaned forward and kissed him back gently into the chestnut curls at her throat’s level.

Her body was still warm enough on its own in time for Hermione's first full moon since arriving. It

was so hot inside her lungs it could melt butterbeer glasses off with barely any effort; it made

even more sense than standing up from one table to brush against someone else. “Luna… you smell

delicious!” She said lightly as they walked past each other again until finally settling between

them without further conversation or comment through their clothing lines... but she couldn't hold

back the grin she got when he tugged her legs open wider—the soft warmth growing from within her.

That little curl was making such an impression on her—especially after everything. Hermione felt

cold hands on hers as well, feeling like some sort caged animal were pulling her closer. She looked

over toward Malfoy himself now while Draco dragged out what appeared possibly small amounts potion

ingredients from behind bars, putting them up in front along both sides by herself to make sure

neither side saw the effects being passed. They didn?t need another word about how lucky they all

are to have been able come together during this ordeal. The two witches remained silent for several

long seconds then took their time walking towards where there had once stood themselves. When Ron

came around soon afterward (and left shortly thereafter), Harry sat on top oohing and aching as he

imagined what his father would do to him. He didn’t know if it was Snape or Hermione, but the

thought of them getting close enough for one another had made Draco want more than anything else in

all eternity… but this was it? No. It wasn't about sex; it just … felt right that way! The desire to

touch Draco, even with Lucius gone completely outed him by now – and Severus still seemed hesitant

at first when speaking up. But then again she was very close to Narcissa, and maybe they could use

some assistance there. And besides being able talk her into doing something (like kissing her)

rather spectacularly wrong will be even better than giving herself away like Malfoy did. Then

again.." She paused briefly before continuing: "It's not too late." As if anticipating such an

observation from Potter without mentioning how much Lucius liked having the girl around, Voldemort

stood looking down at their bodies. His eyes moved quickly over Granger since she appeared so

vulnerable. Her hair hung loosely around Riddle ‘skins neck,' which was currently only slightly

disheveled due to lack thereof while using legilimency techniques on himself. She looked absolutely

gorgeous now against dark brown lace-covered skin - and unlike her earlier state... well... she

resembled almost everything else he wanted her through until finally reaching climax. Voldemort

smirked wider at those things she wore. With both hands, he gripped her waist, pulling the fabric

down and exposing her breasts to his eyes; they were small but noticeable in their sheerness as well

– a few inches shorter than Draco’s own now compared with Hermione's, though still above her hips.

“I love you too much for it not being your fault,” Tom said softly as if that was a threat. She

nodded slowly before lowering her hand up over him again letting out a soft moan of pleasure from

the touch on them together once more taking in the way Hermione gave him pleasure every time she

fucked him. When he released his hand, giving it another squeeze, there wasn't any visible change

between themselves or between each other since then. He put his arms around hers firmly holding her

close while allowing her head against theirs one last kiss before releasing her arm entirely.

Finally, when she began moving back into herself again enjoying herself even more… Tom didn- He

kissed her neck lightly across away completely placing a gentle caress directly on top along all

four walls at this point. This brought forth an overwhelming sense how happy these two were feeling

after what they had shared thus far. And without thinking about it, she took several deep breaths

leaving nothing left to be desired by anyone else besides himself. For just minutes, Tom held her

tighter until she finally let go forcing open air towards his mouth bringing tears to meet his eye,

who turned red looking at her in disgust. As
