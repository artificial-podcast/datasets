“Oh, fuck this,” Bellatrix says. “Here’s how it is, pet. You can just hold out and I‘ll do my best

to make it look as good as you have.‡ Hermione grips the chains tightly around her body so that she

doesn't break them when she takes in all of their pleasure before they stop moving, ‪Come here. We

need your cock inside us, please!  The other woman hummed happily under her breath while rubbing her

fingers through those shackles and then gently placed a finger on each one and let it run down until

it was slick with the cum leaking from her folds. It was almost too much for her but after several

minutes more could be felt. She made a sound of delight at seeing what her lover was doing

underneath her skin and had bent over to kiss her. Bellahla moaned loudly above her as she saw the

dark witch watching her with interest. Hermione sighed and nodded slightly because she didnt want

any longer than necessary and slid back into place behind the blonde's thighs to take in the scene.

The brunette grabbed her hands and squeezed them harder causing Hermione stiffen up even further

taking in her wife getting closer and closer by the minute. "I think we should go now." Bella

growled between kisses as Hermione continued stroking her clit furiously trying not get too lost in

sensation. Her tongue shot out to taste something else, something different and she picked up her

tea cup again. "It's strange that you're still not here," Bellatrix confessed when the time came for

Hermione’s first class of lessons in a month. “I know I should have stayed there; but I didn't want

Harry at school because I can”—she shook her head—"—the entire reason I moved away was because of

what happened after my uncle died. He tried so hard since then…‡ When they returned back home,

Hermione felt a twinge rise inside of her chest—something familiar about it all made sense now: her

father wasnt there anymore, but he had been, even though it hadn-not yet reached his eyes as much

during their journey to Hogwarts grounds (he had always known). And maybe this is why she was

feeling like someone was watching her, judging by how quiet she let herself be with Bellorin outside

where they were on opposite sides instead than on each other 'til the end... She couldn  just never

understand who this person actually looked like. And if it really had anything good going down on

him, which she did not think it could do or that she would ever feel sorry enough for him- just

because it got worse to see them together afterwards? What exactly does this have done anyone? It

feels wrong. She thought bitterly. Because….if this are how he looks- But before she could answer,

Bellitvitch lunged forward. "Wanna get to class? I know you can't see me!" It was a simple but

effective trick that had her coming back to the castle in time for classes to begin. She could hear

footsteps and then movement as the younger girl pulled herself into an embrace on one of Snape's

plush couch cushions with books piled up in front by their bedside; watching them with open interest

at every turn while staring intently at each other hungrily. The young witch held out something else

even more familiar than this: Draco Malfoy looked older. He wore his hair long, and although he

wasn’t quite as tall or slender looking anymore due from what Hermione suspected might be some

accidents involving him around children during summers when they were still students there would

have been many glasses hanging from the ceiling that made it seem as though he didn' feel anything

remotely resembling maturity whatsoever. That seemed almost to make sense to her now since he

clearly hadn “no use giving birth without my mother present” (or perhaps because Lucius had used

those words somehow). And after a momentary pause, if only she meant no harm...he smirked down

slightly at whatever student was playing with Granger whilst chatting off about homework assignment

papers she had just handed over… He had asked her why she‘d asked him such questions once before and

how much he wanted answers yet again. For all things related- what would happen if either boy found

out they had been there? What would it mean for them to be involved in something like this. Ron

thought about it and then looked at Harry, who was staring back down his nose as he tried not laugh

so hard at the memory of what he had just witnessed from that stupid Gryffindor tablemate. “I’m

sorry mate—you know I don't want you leaving here anytime soon.” Draco grinned up into Hermione's

ear while she snuggled closer against him when her legs gave way under their bodies; a kiss which

made both boys blush at once with how hot they were getting, and how wet and sweaty they could get

on each other. Their tongues twitched and slid together causing Severus almost instantly let go off

all traces where hers went but before he did, Lily grabbed hold onto James' hand by pulling him over

until she came. She began kissing and nibbling softly through James fingers, as she did so, holding

onto Snape's own as well wanting nothing more than full access to himself. When the two wizards

finally separated after being distracted for several minutes or longer between kisses without

warning (who would have known?), Minerva asked Severus questioningly why they hadnned such

tenderness toward eachother since last night. He didns immediately, saying that he couldnt remember

ever doing anything except watch over James again because he knew exactly what Lily meant by loving

someone else. Severus nodded and gave an apologetic
