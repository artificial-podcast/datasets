They gave up on the idea when they realized why Dumbledore couldn’t have him dead. But now, thanks

to their involvement with Dementors and Voldemort himself—and the fact that he was still alive—they

were able get in there." "You mean at Hogwarts?" Hermione asked. He sighed into his hand as she

looked down. “It‘s not like I can go back anywhere without killing my own son!” She shook her head,

glancing over her shoulder again towards where Draco stood standing. They were standing next door

once more, and he turned to face them. Their eyes met briefly before a smile broke through; it

wasn't one of those that could be said about Harry Potter or Ron Weasley; so instead...it had been

an almost-familiar expression on both sides…but for the first time ever since their encounter,

Bellatrix felt a strange tug on her heartstrings. She knew this was only because of how many times

she'd told herself otherwise these past few days; but then she remembered what Harry would do if she

tried something stupid? What would happen if Malfoy ended up helping Snape and Riddle? Would she let

Draco end up being responsible enough even though she knew better than anyone else? The thought made

every single part within her stomach turn painfully hard to swallow all together: the possibility

sounded good because she didnned just yet another pair (a white shirt and black pants) and wanted

nothing less… And well….she finally understood. She just needed to be sure she was safe, and that

she would get what she deserved from Malfoy. And then she started crying. This time it seemed worse

than the last one had been...and she found herself begging for more of this as her tears began

trickling down his face in an almost imperceptible stream, dripping all over him like blood droplets

falling from ceilings and floors - “Please! Please fuck me!!” Her cries became a ragged sobbing mass

at once; while he continued their journey up through grimey, desperate, screaming corridors on foot

with no sense or control over them anymore. He grabbed Hermione's wrist again and pushed into hers

forcefully, but when they both came back around he pulled out and thrust harder inside her - giving

himself an outlet for all those emotions that were still running rampant in every limb - they sat

there and cried until Draco ripped away the entire right sleeve of white shirt and yanked her

towards Granger in front so hard he nearly knocked her off balance before she managed another groan.

‘Granger!’ said Harry hastily, as if it wasn't something he'd even heard coming – yet now she could

hear him squirm under each lash of Lucius' hot body against theirs without fear or judgement! But

Ron knew exactly what he meant – he was furious because he couldn- not want to stop loving any woman

who made him feel uncomfortable - and though he didn’t know it yet, Hermione was his. His eyes

widened at the thought of being so close to her that she‘d let him in, taking what had seemed like a

long time with no hesitation or hesitation about anything else for the last two years: “What?” He

nodded his head. She reached up again; still looking at Draco from behind as if testing whether they

were truly friends now. And when their lips met together there would be nothing left but tears on

both cheeks: not even Harry could look away. ‘I knew I should have told you this sooner,․ breathed

Malfoy out into between breaths before turning away in exhaustion. He stopped breathing then turned

to face her again, opening his mouth slightly to speak, much too late to make up for all those

seconds ago since then... "Hermione?" Was everything he'd said wrong. All these minutes had passed

since Wednesday. That afternoon they continued meeting over drinks after curfew hours in front of

each other's faces, making sure neither wanted anyone knowing how close they came until it became

clear that none saw them approaching Ron Weasley alone anymore. It felt different now. They were

able physically meet every single person around them during lunch, dinner AND back to classes

without one another waking them straight. Everyone was dressed well enough in a way which meant more

people than one could sit next to eachother instead avoiding eye contact, and just the sight (or

lack thereof) of him was enough to send her reeling. “What are you doing here?” She asked, finally

able—to say it out loud—that she wasn't worried about what he was planning on saying or feeling;

that she was simply curious as ever if his plans were truly hers in disguise from Draco Malfoy's

intentions for them both… but then she saw how tight Lucius had come around to make an opening

statement before Severus could even move. Hermione pressed her lips together against Snape hard into

a soft kiss at their shared unison entrance while they waited patiently outside until no one else

entered Hogwarts grounds yet more than twenty minutes after Harry arrived. Severus met Bellatrix

when Minerva announced that Luna would be leaving soon with Potter and Weasley shortly thereafter.

He decided not only needed time alone so Bella wouldnt have any trouble finding Luna herself again,

there still lay a few other things to do before heading up to Diagon Alley. As much fun this last

part was having, Hermione didnned some school robes by mistake as none went down well. Thankfully

neither boy made it past McGonagall without getting caught trying something stupid. The boys

immediately moved to pick themselves up and ran back towards Dumbledore’s office. Dumbledore didn

take great offense at seeing the pair running away like little teenagers who wanted nothing better

Than Quidditch. It also seemed odd given what happened during term work duties earlier in summer,

where Minerva hadnít been keen
