This was why she was somewhat jealous of Bellatrix, whose boobs were usually quite large.  She had

noticed that the guys and girls around her liked to tease Hermione with their sex, but now she could

be a bit more creative in that regard. She couldn't really blame him for wanting something from his

girlfriend. He certainly wasn’t going out there to do things like this without her permission – not

at all! He was right…but it didnÕt have anything important on its mind, so he just wanted some

formative experience! “It sounds fun sometimes anyway...? You know I love you! And I would

definitely enjoy watching your tits bounce down my cock again soon if we ever got together before

Halloween or Christmas time. So, donÐt worry, I promise! Let me see them tomorrow; they should look

amazing when I come back later today. They are perfect and I want every single one inside! There is

nothing wrong about that gift! It has been ages since our last encounter! This year has proved us

both wrong! We need help getting them set up properly! I can already see your eyesight! My mum told

Mum how wonderful this idea became after she read The Daily Prophet - I believe she went into hiding

because Ron won Òthe Quidditch match against Gryffindor first thing Wednesday morning!Ó Draco

mumbled. "I bet Ginny will give Weasley a lot oomph!"Hermione chuckled softly as she stood up and

started to walk towards the door. She pulled out her wand and cast a calming spell, cleaning

everything from inside. Harry began pacing nervously in front of his bed and Ron was sitting on one

end."Ron?" she whispered."You okay?""I'm fine, just...just..." Hermione looked down at herself with

worry etched across her face while still being in her pajamas.""What happened? Did you hurt

yourself?" he asked, trying not even think about what had happened between them."No, I didn't," she

sighed absently before taking a deep breath for emphasis again once more but didn’t look back. "It

was just too much. You should've known better.""I know exactly how to deal with people like that

when I don-""Do you really want me here?" Parvati shot back angrily. Shaking off all thoughts they

were having around their relationship now it seemed it would be best if she simply shut up first. A

few minutes later after a light kiss Hermione opened her eyes slightly and smiled at him

sincerely."So are we going home soon then?" He asked as he pushed himself away from her so he could

watch her sleep.Hermiones chest heaved heavy into her stomach as if someone had pressed a pillow

against her. Her eyelids fluttered closed briefly; clearly not expecting any reaction or emotion

from either side because they werenÕt sleeping. The room suddenly filled with a feeling of

loneliness, a pang that lingered in her chest for some time. How was she supposed to feel safe with

him? What could have happened if he had gone on like this? ÒHermione…Ó ÔI need you here right now!Ù

ÜWeØve got it all figured out already – but I don’t want anyone else knowing about what weÐre

doing.Ý âLook at me again; IÑm not going anywhere until everyone is safely there and everything will

be okay before the end or I just leave you alone. You canìn get away with this without giving

yourself too much trouble. Itþs your fault. And Ginny has said she wants us both dead. I would

gladly give up my life to save Hermione from being put into such horrible situations. ÀNow go, love–

go and wake them up before I do anything rash, please: I need Ron back for tonight anywayÉà la mia

tambour de lumière à ma chérie vain te fait une coeur huit étoiles après pour moi en financierai

 -tu es bellissimais ce que tu jouir, mon fille nous et mon français est dans un grande être plus

-ermita tellement.” She took a deep breath and stared out the window.  “I am so sorry.  I just

missed you, my sweet Hermione Granger…it was so wonderful to see all of us together again! Thank

goodness we had such fun on our first date at Hogwarts in November and now that spring is here

everyone is getting married! It feels like this year has been a long time coming! Let me be

perfectly clear: I am not thrilled about being with Draco Malfoy or his friends – it's going too

far! But if you are feeling especially proud for him please come home and have some chocolate from

your favourite cocoa bar! And yes there will always still Beauxbatons – he won't hurt us even if

Ginny catches wind of them, either!! Right…oh and donÕt worry about running off next week; they were

excellent hosts as well. You should keep up appearances when Molly starts her day at school anyway–

oh, and do try telling her how nice she looks by now, alright? Goodnight! May Godric bless you both!

So goodnight Professor Blaise Zabini AND THE BEABIAS!!! The end This concludes what was already a

very lengthy discussion session regarding Ron Weasley (and indeed Harry Potter) becoming Head

Boy/Boyfriend today afternoon. First, Pansy Parkinson gave an unasked question concerning how the

two would approach Ron after he had gone through puberty-forming
