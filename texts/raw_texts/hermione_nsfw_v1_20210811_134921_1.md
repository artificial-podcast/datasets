She could be very bossy, but that was nothing compared to the Mistress she became when they were

naked and aroused as fuck. She found her way over to her own desk and started sucking on one of his

nipples with a soft touch.   “That was delicious,” she moaned with her mouth open wide at how

fucking good it felt for him! He looked down before smirking. ‘You are going too far I think?’ he

thought. Hermione chuckled softly and stroked him back. Her hands moved up his body, finding their

way down his chest until she reached his waistband which wrapped around his cock between them both

in waves like heat traveling through bodies vibrating together like fireworks. He groaned loudly

against himself as her tongue covered him then left him wanting again. The witch hummed into his ear

letting out another moan after this time. It was clear that she enjoyed pleasing him enough already.

So long though, he simply couldn't keep from moaning now. His eyes rolled slightly onto herself

trying not so much catch her attention right away. "Fuck, yes! You taste amazing!" The sweet voice

that had been mumbling about this moment came rushing forth once more. Ron knew what the voice meant

and didnÕt even bother answering any longer. As soon said name came forth, the witch turned to face

him as if daring him everagain just to tell her off. Then Draco entered her willingly causing

Hermione nearly hyperventilating all the while.  “I’m not giving up on her, Draco Malfoy! I can

still live with myself if you do that to me or not—”Hermione paused before she could even finish and

pulled at his hair again as he continued pushing forward onto a chair next door in silence for a few

seconds longer than necessary between them both thought it would take him an eternity but decided

against doing so. She was trying desperately hard now… so very stubborn indeed."I think we should

talk about this right away," Theo whispered when they finally sat down together, arms crossed over

their waists and legs crossed across each other's chests in front of one another completely

unencumbered by any formulating desires for either side; neither of which made anything easier on

Harry Potter beyond getting to know the other and yet being unable to separate from him after what

had happened earlier tonight through some sort duress. "Right then?""Yeah.""Do us both want nothing

more? No need telling your parents how much better things are going without our help?"Harry was

definitely starting too much. He had just finished eating breakfast last night. At least he didn't

have to go back to Grimmauld Place since Pansy had already stepped out of bed during lunch. There

were several other things he needed answers for, and well... no.He wanted Dobby but didnÕt quite see

why he did. With no way into Dumbledore anymore, they would be doomed. Harry had a new plan in place

to try and get back at Voldemort before the Horcrux attack took him down as well."Do you know what

it is?" Pansy asked with an annoyed voice. She knew that Sirius was still alive after all. He'd been

trying for three years now but if there were any other questions she wanted answered about his past,

then something must have changed between them.But like every time her mind wandered away from the

events of last night's meeting or how she felt when she saw Ron on top once again, Harry quickly

learned more than enough about life before death. It was only right this time though that much work

needed done so far.There wasn't anything wrong with looking up things around the manor without

having people see through their wards. When James came out tonight during dinner everyone else

looked at him with shocked expressions on their faces. They waited patiently until Lily said 'Harry,

can we talk?' "What? No... not really" Harry tried desperately while holding Hermione close. "We

need to speak privately first.""You don’t understand," Lily replied snickering. “If I ever leave

here alone..." Harry almost shouted over the conversation-something similar happened occasionally

since just talking seemed so easy. The moment Mrs Weasley started to run off leaving small gaggles

behind each house and asking some curious questioners who thought perhaps one or two kids might be

there.He didn’t know what to say, he didn't even have a wand and was just standing by the door as

they waited for him back up. It felt like almost five in the morning but Harry did not move at all

when he walked into his room on that day. The girls were already gone since Dobby had been coming

with them."I guess we should get going then.""What do you mean?""You are supposed out of here now,"

Pansy answered quietly before she got her trunk ready."Is that so?" Hermione asked looking around at

her friends, her eyes narrowed."No thanks!" Parvati snorted. "Just..." She opened it and took off

quickly after reaching through the floo-front door, taking in every single thing about where

everything stood. Harry could tell that Luna was still waiting behind Lavender's dormitory while

everyone else was sleeping. There wasnÕt anything particularly new inside though."Are you okay?"

Parvana asked pointing to an empty chair next too close enough between them both which Harry assumed

she was. He turned slowly towards his mate and saw Ginny leaning against the wall reading a book

once again. It looked familiar and pretty and Harry wondered if maybe she ought asking why this was

happening right along with the others.Pansie gave Harry another look and realized something funny

must've happened tonight. Luna had gotten used over the summer; her sister
