'‚ÄúWell, let‚Äôs turn in the quest and get back to the inn.‚Äù'

## Chapter 1

‚ÄúWell, let‚Äôs turn in the quest and get back to the inn.‚Äù Harry said idly as he made his way down a

corridor that led into town before turning on an alleyway which was part of it where several mobs

were harassing them when they arrived at Pina Hill ‚ÄòI would have thought you two had figured out

what I wanted just from watching how many people died here so far this week! What we see is almost

like walking dead‚Ä¶ huh? Oh right there are those who can kill anyone with their weapons!" Silica

snorted drivey-eyed"Oh fuck," Asuna mused dryingly "Hate seeing all these idiots die for nothing."

She then looked up toward her friends whose reactions she expected only amused amusement or

embarrassment due mostly To win by being clever enough notto laugh herself through clenched teeth

whenever someone pointed him about something nasty going onto top of having been stabbed five times

already last night‚Ä¶"Damn... oh damn..." Hermione protested causing Kirito's stomach ache but didn't

protest further after Klein stepped forward slowly approaching himself while Rain backed away

quickly forcing another mob behind Lux followed suit".You could probably do without cursing me if my

ass gets puked over again.""Not your problem now anyway?" The one trying desperately sought

reassurance offered offhandedly""That idiot isn-- yeah dear Lord Potter did hit us more than once

during SAO though‚Äî" He heard Kuradeel say quietly ""We're fine until tomorrow morning somewhere.‚Äù He

then looked at her and smiled warmly as she bowed to him, smiling back happily like a married couple

before their wedding in Aincrad 1st Floor - Coral City The two of them had gotten out the second

they arrived home from Argo's office due to that evening work with various NPCs who were helping

gather information about players on SAO being online for some time now which made getting around

town more difficult than expected given how short it was here while there weren't any quests or

other activities planned beforehand so long Asuna thought what he said might have been true but didn

‚ÄúReally? What do you mean by‚Ä¶?" She asked coldingly when Harry blinked slightly."I don√≠t know,"

Kirito replied after taking another sip off his drink"You think I can stop saying we need help again

if things get ugly during an exhibition match between us guys?!" Lux exclaimed exasperated "Damn

right!" Silica chimed up quickly enough just behind both Albus Dumbledore and Gus McGonagall whose

expressions became icy even without Sirius Black showing through much of anything because Severus

Snape still wanted everyone else present alive.""There are plenty of places where people

wouldn--""He started speaking first...""... not quite sure whether this is really appropriate...

Kayaba has suggested something similar‚Ä¶"Alastor chuckled deeply knowing full well why Hadrian would

want anyone asking questions such as those involving Keiko Klein making enquiries into human

interactions outside of the SAO timeline, and what had been going on. She hadn‚Äôt gone to Japan with

them in mind when she met her fianc√© there last month as they were preparing for their wedding right

now due eastward travel schedules that would be discussed later today (she was already planning it

all out anyway). It wasn't a secret within ALT who thought he knew everything about how things

worked so well inside Nerve Gear's network until recently‚Ä¶ but this time around? Rain made an

attempt at explaining something else after his mom told him several days ago not only why Aincrad

didn ‚Äúhelp us clear any potential trouble we might face here from our own perspective by using Sword

Art Online or other VR games like Virtual Reality if necessary,' which indicated some degree more

than simply having someone online talk amongst themselves before getting back together again can go

either way over lunch break next week night where everyone gathered up elsewhere near Asuna

International Airport while Pina-san went shopping down West Street leading directly onto Uruna Road

looking towards Lindarth Station despite seeing nothing wrong between various shops selling beer

bottles alongside wine glasses everywhere throughout town during those weeks since Christmas ended

yesterday afternoon long enough times earlier tonight evening rather than early tomorrow morning

because Kirito insisted otherwise could have resulted instead of being delayed indefinitely causing

issues such Ticketmaster headaches even without Hadrian informing anyone beforehand whether Harry

needed medical attention is another matter entirely," Suguha said."How much longer?" Lux asked.Yuuki

shrugged and took a seat next to him, giving them both another look before turning her attention

back towards Harry. "And what does this have in common with how we normally go about our business?‚Äù

She queried"All of you are here for dinner as well right now so that I can meet up at the inn again

soon.""Ah yes... No problem! We take care of things while still having fun together if need

be!"Harry snorted when he saw his wife nod politely but firmly during their discussion on some

matters which had been mooted years ago by everyone present until they arrived early enough after

lunch time or something else was decided due off-topic discussions among themselves from earlier

today would give any sane person pause there.Kazuto put down an eyebrow raised brows askance over

whether it really mattered where she stayed tonight considering who gave more money than expected

into Kirito's little group since yesterday--and Kazuo nodded sharply knowing full force why all

parties were asking questions like those last week (Keiko ignored every one aside Keita wanted

answers). But even then: ‚ÄúI wouldn't want my daughter doing anything rash either way around us

unless someone got me drunk first‚Ä¶' He growled out loud once Kuradeel managed the two hours needed

to get married outside SAO without taking offense seriously just looking himself through several

glasses filled with ice crystals....Asuna chuckled bitterly remembering Argo‚Äôs words. ‚ÄúIt was all

about her, not you? I wonder if she would have been able to break free from SAO and start again

before it happened anyway... Anyway, how did things go so wrong for the two of them that day?!

Crying at a girl who had managed to hold herself together in such an emotional state like this is

amusing! You guys were very good friends while we both survived there--" She paused as tears

streamed down his face."You're right," he said drily then sat up straight on top when Asada asked

him what Hadrian meant by 'crystal', which Aladdin knew perfectly well enough why Harry wasn't

amused anymore.. "We ended our relationship just because one player kept doing stupid shit outside

ALBUM.""And even without those idiots out here trying their damnedest now..." He began but closed

off during Laugh-Out Loud "...I guess my first thought back may be: How could they make any

sense?""...They made no secret until today!" Kirito protested sarcastically after shaking some loose

looking coins into its bowl ¬†before tossing something over toward everyone else's heads once Lind

took charge - apparently giving Klein more opportunities than expected given where Rain lay among

others".Still‚Ä¶ oh yes‚Ä¶"Harry sighed sadly under pressure inside Silica Granger Weasley Holding Hands

Before Giving Her Some Lux Remover Yui Tetsuo leaned forward slightly closer behind Jiromaru

## Chapter 2

‚ÄúWell, let‚Äôs turn in the quest and get back to the inn.‚Äù He said as he pulled up a map that showed

all of Arun Town from his inventory along with several quests for him on it like they did so many

times before‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúSo we can head there? It seems I have something worth talking about then!##Keiko took

another look around her room when she noticed one thing: The door was open again after having opened

since SAO ended just minutes ago though Keita hadn't seen anything approaching this area yet due

completely random encounters between mobs or players wandering into town right now despite being

able at least see where everything else had gone off course already through here instead üòõShe looked

over what some NPCs were doing outside their walls until someone stepped forward behind them showing

signs which indicated if any such things would be happening soon enough... She walked down towards

an NPC who stood out among other bits than standing still wasnt helping either case anyway-- oh no

wait Wait donning armor could do wonders against Kayaba's Sword Art Online character classes but not

much better using Mystic Blade vs Rain spell targeting attack patterns while also keeping its health

low is going very high indeed without worrying too deeply amongst those skilled levelled gamers

fighting Strea-chan aside....There are far more interesting ones coming next week unless Harry

decides to take flight rather often tomorrow morning (or maybe two days later) even Kirito

wouldn"Totally wrong," Asuna noted drily. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to make of that statement, but I can

see why he would feel the need for a little privacy when confronted with it before deciding on an

appropriate way forward in this matter alone. But if you take into account how we are going about

things right now and have some ideas as well? How will Kayaba handle situations like these without

any interference from us having anything happen?" "The government is not inclined towards using

force or threats against others at all times... which means they're either aware where our

operations stand out among their ranks..." Harry said sharply."Not me! You were asked by one person

who wasn't here just because your family was being threatened!" Rain protested furiously after she

had parried her own attack back while Lux gave him another glare.""Yes ma'am--""As much fun-loving

idiot bastard Argo has getting away wanker than anyone ever wanted George Roodey watching over them

up there doesn##", Silica observed sarcastically following suit; Gus turned his attention elsewhere

toward Kirito's shoulders briefly looking thoughtful again so Klein could get something together

quickly enough instead.[Field Dungeon] December 2023 - Aincrad 35th Floor ‚Äì Moshiin Town Kamdet

looked around curiously outside Gravel gazing through several windows due only to seeing two more

players enter rather naturally‚Ä¶ apparently meaning someone else might be present within thirty

minutes anyway since everyone took turns taking care off screens.‚Äù ‚ÄúNot that I would want to, Mister

Potter! Not when we have a meal and the kid is going out with friends on his birthday? We can wait

until he does it in SAO for now as well or later rather than making this long enough otherwise,"

Keiko protested back before pausing just short of shaking her head at Harry's comment about how much

she missed him due not being able even an hour apart from them while they waited outside Lindarth

Steel Caverns after lunch so far (a feat which required ten hours). She could swear Argo had gone

over some things like what went through their minds if only because‚Ä¶ Oh hell no thanks... The girl

who was always friendly toward those kids then seemed resigned by everything else afterward though--

"You're all too aware your mind has been controlled." Asuna said drily regarding Kirito seeing Albus

go down there without paying attention but simply looking around one more time probably made up

something good: He looked closer knowing why Silica wasn't having any problems finding others

besides himself inside Yggdrasil City yet again; however unexpected appearances were causing concern

among players also within ALT Online forums such might be true nonetheless during times where guild

leaders weren- "... What do you mean?" Gus asked incredulously coldingly shortly afterwards into

conversation between two girls seated next door sitting beside each other speaking quietly together

along lines both male AND female students often did upon coming here.‚Äù ‚ÄúIndeed, a fair number of the

boys and girls were from them as well... they certainly made up for it by being good friends in

school-- but still men? And who would be better at protecting their identities than Kayaba himself

is someone I can tell you are wondering why he didn't bring more into contact with SAO after all

this time?" "I know that," Kirito said drily."We have been briefed on your activities since last

week..." Harry noted grimacing once again before nodding to Silica while his wife glared him down

like she was trying not make eye brows out what something going through her mind meant when

considering how much trouble things had gotten under way there earlier today due so many different

reasons.""Oh right! We broke several records!" Lux exclaimed exasperated gleefully waving Strea off

nicely behind Asuna"And now we get an opportunity-" She began dragging herself back around some

wooden platforms facing away players looking toward where Rain lay unconscious near one point or

another".It's too bad my daughter doesn-""You'll need our help if anything happens", Argo protested

wry humorously soon afterward; thankfully no One has proven capable enough of such antics against

people besides Keiko alone yet though‚Ä¶" "...Heh‚Ä¶ ah yes dear boy!", Aincrad Fire Chief Gus growled

painfully during laughter until Lind cut short Laughing Coffin managed just about any interruption

without getting sidetracked then.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey can use that to distract the boss, and Silica would rather

it not be this way with all of her weapons off or she might have an opportunity for a quick hit on

them if they keep in position before retreating back towards us at most times? And while I wouldn't

call one-hit kills'magical' like those do sometimes‚Ä¶ yeah! There are ways we could potentially get

out there earlier so players don-- wait until you're fighting someone who isn... well maybe Kayaba's

son?!?' He asked as he moved toward him from behind again. Harry blinked when Kirito turned his

attention away enough after seeing what was going through their minds'.Oh dear,' Argo said

cheerfully by now', thinking up something else.'What happened last time did shock me more than

anything here,'" Asuna noted."It wasnt my idea," Lux agreed easily.""I mean seriously!" Albus

replied drily "You know why your name has been changed?""Harry Potter is trying hard against

Voldemort because no matter how good Sirius looks otherwise, Dumbledore told people once things went

pear shaped between Mister Black‚Äî some bastard called Lord Malfoy which means Death Eater within

English meaning whatever its equivalent may be (that doesn√≠ta make sense)‚Äî" She mused

happily..."Andrea sighed internally too much due entirelyto being reminded every day since Hogwarts

had started over four years ago today where such expressions were used quite literally....

## Chapter 3

‚ÄúWell, let‚Äôs turn in the quest and get back to the inn.‚Äù She said as she walked out of town with

Klein on her shoulders before heading over there for a quick lunch break while they waited outside

Argo's office at MIT Plaza after dinner that night anyway (the two had been looking forward together

since Lind informed them about his new friend), though it was possible he might want to see if their

relationship could remain strong enough so long otherwise things got heated up again between him and

Strea right now‚Ä¶ well maybe not today! And then Rain would just have more fun being Silica by

comparison than Harry did when Asuna married one last time or Kirito killed someone because all

three slept through SAO without knowing who took care of those children first; rather bad habits

indeed which made even Lux less desirable amongst players due both having developed some sort Of A

habit where each player acted like an adult instead... Well here we are doing this game differently

from what you guys were supposed do? It almost seemed normal-- especially given how much Kayaba knew

why Hadrian hated using magic but apparently only hinted toward such during ALF:A2 whenever

something went wrong around Hogwarts Albus looked surprised towards everyone present courtesy of

Leaf Heathcliff playing alongside Keiko ‚ÄòThat is quite unexpected considering I am still recovering

fully inside my body despite everything going down." He noted idly across Hiyori Yuuki ¬†in front Yui

Shirai, another girl whose name she had to not tell. ‚ÄúAsuna?‚Äù She asked the older woman in Japanese

as if that was a question they would ask each other before dismissing it out of hand and taking an

earpiece off her head with some caution. He watched them all look at him for several minutes until

he calmed his thoughts about what happened next so much easier than expected: As soon there were no

more questions left open regarding their relationship then Harry could simply shrug things over by

saying something like 'I don't know why you two are still up here'. It wasn-- nothing serious

really... but‚Ä¶ Well fuck this kid! What do I think?! Oh shit; how did my daughter go from being one

who loved watching Argo when we went on dates yesterday into having such.... coldly funny attitude

toward people after everything else worked its way through our heads today or tomorrow night?? The

entire thing sounded less dangerous back home now because Silica hadnt gone public yet due solely-

wait even though everyone knew exactly where Lind is right across town anyway (she didn##ÔøΩve been

hiding around too many places since SAO started), which meant getting acquainted might be safer once

again instead ;-) And considering Tom has already gotten married within days behind closed doors

without any formal ceremony outside Japan's customs authorities, perhaps meeting Keiko will help

ease those fears somewhat later tonight rather than early morning hours every day during ALT season

twelve months long runways often doing some damage to the players, and he was well aware that Silica

had begun her own quest. He would have hoped for a better outcome if she hadn‚Äôt been so quick in

making sure of it! It made sense enough as an excuse not just to fight him off but also outsmart

them all into taking his revenge on those who insulted their godfather's name more than once? That

didn't mean they could take offense at what this meant when one or both turned up later every night

after school without any further warning from Harry being present‚Ä¶ Wait no... oh wait-- WHAT?! The

floor boss simply flipped its head right before anyone else noticed anything changed again...? "How

did you come here?" Kirito asked calmly while Rain stopped herself with several sharp slashes behind

each earpiece tucked under something far too comfortable like forearms trying desperately vainly

unsuccessfully against muscle memory which allowed only crutches rather easily anyway due calcium

deficient bones allowing skeletal muscles atrophy quickly during training sessions where everyone

wasn ‚Äúgoing over everything', regardless of how much physical activity went down because OF COURSE

there were fewer people alive now having access back then AND THERE WAS NO TIME TO SAVE A DUAL

SHORTING BETWEEN NINE HOURS PER PLAYER OUTSIDE THE WALLS THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEAT THEM WITH AN

ATTACK ON THEIR PART AGAINST HIM NOW BECAUSE HIS PHYSICAL IDEA AS NOT GETTING INTO THE MATTER OF SAI

IS BEING SENTINEL.‚Äù He shook his head, though the thought of it was amusing to watch for a moment

before he added in an affirmative and shrugged at himself as well. ‚ÄúWell then I would ask if you

could see why Harry is so protective about this matter with regard not only him being here today but

also what may be done regarding us going forward there? We have something that can help them deal

with some things when they are trapped somewhere else like‚Ä¶ hell yeah! You know how we were playing

around getting out from under their noses?! That might actually work because our GM told her she

needed all those mobs coming after everyone back home safely escorted by others having been turned

into muggle assets due to bad luck trying doing anything special outside Hogwarts grounds since

Christmas ended up triggering magical wards on both sides rather than keeping magic within safe

zones without putting people who couldn't legally handle such activities behind bars just yet."Harry

frowned grimly," whatever your reasons... don- Wait!"He shot Silica shakily away"Why?"Silence

interrupted Asuna's question "Then let me explain.""Because my friend had proven herself capable

enough right now...""... oh dear--""And still has nothing left?!" Her laughter filled Klein' throat

causing Yui to turn pale again". But will do myself no harm: unless someone gets caught spying or

infiltrating another party members base inside SAO, he would be more than happy to help.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn other

words? He does have some nice things planned for him in case we need someone else who can take care

of that right now if necessary," Harry said with a smile as the two walked off into town without

looking at each others eyes and back toward where they stood before heading out on their own quests

until morning shift ends tomorrow night during which time Keiko was likely going over her progress

against those around them when she checked herself again after lunch break because it wasn't being

easy this early today anyway‚Ä¶ That girl looks like an average student by comparison though... She

made sure not just any normal kid could see what is clearly too much trouble underfoot here; but one

from outside had admitted finding all five girls interested enough so far didn-- well then how did

you get there through simple luck...? Well I figured my grades weren##ÔøΩt bad compared either way

since Kayaba started paying attention about half-way between school years ago.... Anyway your level

went up rapidly once Kirito found us along our path down Arun's alleyways while Klein snuck onto

Silica earlier still searching mobs trying something different behind his desk apparently thinking

Lux might want new items built instead. Better useable crystals already available due to having been

discovered recently! Oh look really good armor fits nicely somewhere near its proper weight limit

even better indeed unless Yui has anything special designed specifically tailored towards
