'“Dumbledore? Did he do anything?” He asked as he walked in front of'

## Chapter 1

“Dumbledore? Did he do anything?” He asked as he walked in front of the door. “He said Dumbledore is

here to see what I need for breakfast, and then we can talk about something else...I don't know how

long they are going on, but it could be weeks or months… Maybe two weeks at most. Just a few days

until tomorrow morning when that first big new information comes out--like why Harry Potter has been

so upset with you this whole time, except Hermione told me everything she knows! She just gave her

life-saving powers back; no doubt all our parents have since helped put him down. But now Voldemort

is trying his hand again, because if Malfoy keeps playing by my rules anymore—he will try

desperately not kill any more people before Nico gets there. That would make us both better fighters

than ever before. They won't get away with that after tonight, especially considering your mother

had been poisoned herself last night by Lucius during their first duel--so hopefully Hades didn  die

too soon." Nico shook himself awake from his nightmare of what happened yesterday."What did you

say?" Percy asked once dawn broke over them next day."Nothing," Annabeth replied. "It was

nothing."The demigods sat up straight, leaning against the stone wall near Hagrid's hut where Nico

had found Sirius Black. The wizards were dressed normally enough for today though, even knowing each

other's schedules. It was nice meeting anyone else, but I still didn't like the idea of going back

to school in America."She let out a harsh laugh and her eyes darted around Harry as he tried not

think about his past at all,"No one is allowed anywhere near you if they are underage or under

16.""So what does that mean?" Rhode asked with an annoyed look on her face for emphasis."For now,

just stay away from my brother. He has nothing against us.""I know-"Rhode looked up at him

expectantly before addressing Su, "He'll be fine without me.""That sounds good! And hey, we can do

this later!" Lee shouted cheerfully as she pulled their things into smaller bags."Alright, alright."

The daughter-of Poseidon grinned at her friend who nodded once, getting off her seat and leaving

them alone."Su, right? You're taking care of these kids after everything bad happened here.""Well,

okay, thanks."Lee nodded reluctantly, looking over at his girlfriend. They made it safely back

towards the Forbidden Forest where they could see some more students bustling amongst themselves.

After making sure everyone had left by midnight, Annabeth led them upstairs to get ready for bed.

The four of them went down to breakfast when they heard voices coming through the

door."Wha...Where'd Dumbledore send those guys?!""It's your turn, Evans""Yeah, sorry." She smiled

sadly while walking toward them next time they entered the Great Hall. “So, you and Percy are going

to school together?” Annabeth asked quietly as she sat down at her desk.Percy nodded in agreement.

He had read about how he and his friends were quite close…so when one of the demigods said that Nico

was a god, it made sense. It seemed like an obvious fit for both of them.Annoyance filled him. So

much so, now with this news, not only did all three know each other well but there wasn't anything

anyone could tell from their reactions. What kind would such strangers expect if someone introduced

themselves as a real person? They didn' really care; just trust me on this one.At least since Will

obviously told Hermione everything between classes today, nobody doubted who or what happened last

night."Hermione?" A familiar voice called out over Harry's ear through thick clouds behind them

across two trees near Hogwarts Tower before rising into the air above them again,"Hey!" The girl

shouted back up at them loud enough everyone turned around, getting confused looks from everybody

else. "What is going on here?!""That old dude I met got some weird powers.""It says 'Expelliarmus'."

Someone spoke away as another man began shouting things related topics aloud inside a large cavern

surrounding Hagrid Manor - apparently a very important part- until once more people started milling

around looking for answers.As soon as Hazel noticed, she ran into the back of a large group and they

all turned to look at her. The two boys had their heads in her lap, both wearing what looked like

camouflage clothing. Their eyes were still very wide, but clearly not letting go; neither seemed

impressed with her ability or skill."You alright?" Nico asked curiously, his voice shaking slightly

from the exhaustion that had taken over him. "Are you hungry?""Yeah," said Hazel quickly again while

her gaze was fixed on the man who’s face only became redder. She grinned widely despite herself

though and continued walking towards Percy's group even faster than before without stopping for an

answer right now...and then another boy came out of nowhere sprinting toward them. He hadn't stopped

until he got closer to where Will sat next to him with his hands crossed behind his

back.""Will..."Nico stumbled backward when it happened."What is it? Where are you going?"He

didn-"I'm sorry about this!" Piper said, her voice sounding almost disbelieving as she pulled away

from him so fast. It wasn  exactly like anything else Chiron would've made, except instead being

more concerned and confused than disturbed at how close Annabeth was just moments ago! What did I

say?!Percy stared at Frank awkwardly, having never seen such panic following someone suddenly lose

sight of each other-"Wait - can we see your head?" Hermione asked innocently."We'll see you soon,

Granger," Nico assured her. "You're welcome to go back later.""Thank the gods for that one!"

Annabeth nodded and she followed him out of the room as he left them alone in their dormitory

together after lunch had started again at midnight on Sunday morning when they found Percy waiting

for Harry before going down to breakfast with his friends"Ron! What's up? Hermione..." He was cut

off by a loud knock from Ron who rushed over to join Draco in the Common Room where he was talking

loudly about something important between himself which also meant “What happened?”The door opened

once more and suddenly everyone there was standing outside looking at it like it might have been

some sort ceremony or something. There were no expressions on either of those faces but rather fear

and confusion all around...and then finally silence. It sounded almost as if someone forced

themselves into not answering another question even though obviously many people wouldn't be able

answer any questions now....so this has to mean somehow Voldemort is behind these deaths......it's

hard being alive without Dumbledore noticing what we are doing.....just how terrible things could

possibly become until everything changes""Oh shit," The blond said worriedly rubbing Will's temples

causing him shiver form nothingness inside him immediately. "It would be nice to talk to my dad

tomorrow since I think today will be an interesting time too -but right here Ginny needs to get done

practicing Divination.” She said with a grimace, “I don't think I've ever seen anyone go through

this yet. Not even Harry and Ron did, but that doesn' mean they can't do it too. If any of you find

yourself in the wrong position then what are your options? Send someone else out there, maybe Nico

will help… Or at least some random person who might know how not-to start getting into trouble for

just doing so when he's good enough!’ Percy nodded reluctantly ‘Good luck trying again though‘Harry

has been extremely busy lately, most likely since Dumbledore told him about us. We need all our

friends together. He isnt going anywhere without us, especially after we send them back home from

their training session before curfew tomorrow evening. When does my magic wear off? The time is

ticking by fast forward ten minutes next week anyway. You were never sure if you would be able to

handle Umbridge as well tonight, or could you use a Patronus Charm to summon her back to Hogwarts on

Friday night? Can you believe she didn...“Nico was really excited last year (he had no idea) when

his girlfriend showed up late one day. So much fun. I knew everyone needed to have another meeting

soon, which meant finding somewhere where we could hang out during their lessons. And although

Peeves seemed like an odd choice for anything but homework and assignments, because

## Chapter 2

“Dumbledore? Did he do anything?” He asked as he walked in front of the portrait. “He didn't, but

then I heard him coming back from a quest with Chiron and that's when things started to change. We

were on the run for years and we got caught by Dumbledore, so now all this is happening again...and

it’s getting worse!‘I stood up straight like crazy because I was scared," Harry muttered, trying not

even smile at his friend."It isn' going alright!" Ron exclaimed and stormed off down the

hallway."Yeah you are!" Hermione said, and shook her head loudly "You never get outta here without

me.""It doesn"t matter who killed you - Voldemort will be dead soon enough; unless you're willing

yourself otherwise there won-""Hermione, stop talking!" she snapped angrily and threw herself onto

top of Ron before rushing after him over half an hour later shouting "All right, go away, don\" t

you dare tell us what happened to Cedric Diggory! You need help, ask any questions no one else does!

All those people-"The two friends stopped mid sentence while they looked around wildly between their

friends looking around curiously confused.Ron found himself staring at them both oddly as if he knew

nothing. Then everyone began whispering something about how strange it could have been for someone

to come into Hogwarts alive. The fact that most of them had seen Fred Weasley die seemed odd since

they’d never met. Harry, Ron and Hermione were in the same boat with Ginny, Lavender Brown was gone

too (except for Luna Lovegood), Nico di Angelo was on his own, Cedric Diggory and Percy Jackson were

also missing, Piper McLean was still alive but apparently no one noticed that she was there.Harry

said “I wonder if anyone else has heard?” Annabeth answered him ‘If so I think it is safe to assume

everybody knows about this story."Hermione put her hand on Harry's shoulder "Do you know who did

this?""Yes.""Is he a son or daughter-""Are you going back to school now?" asked Draco.Both boys

looked at each other confused until both smiled. They all nodded as well before standing up

again.They quickly walked out of the room together avoiding any more suspicious looks from Malfoy's

side. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~When everyone saw what happened tonight Dumbledore turned around

looking annoyed; not only would McGonagall be able get away with having students escort their

children home tomorrow night, instead of being summoned by Snape due early next morning when

everything could fall into place between today and yesterday… which obviously meant Umbridge

wouldn't have time off either!As expected after hearing exactly how much fun Blaise had just spent

making pancakes while playing Quidditch against Sirius Black...everyone knew something bad

wasn going down during lunchtime anyway because it was the perfect time for his new book

club.               Harry had hoped that if he could find out how they went on in Potions, or at

least talk to them about what Umbridge did with Snape after her death, Harry wouldn’t have much of a

problem getting back into Hufflepuff Quidditch practice… Right now though there were only two people

who knew where Hogwarts students got their supplies: one Slytherin and another Ravenclaw student

from Camp Half-Blood Academy (which made him wonder why Hagrid didn't send more teachers). But then

again since this year's mission involved dealing wands directly against monsters...

 “It would be good not knowing anything else,' Draco said as McGonagall sat by behind Melody

Millicent walking over first years together through the common room corridor while Marvus walked

past beside Will Solace staring off toward Gryffindor Tower waiting patiently before going further

up onto Riddle”,Nico thought loudly enough so everyone couldn' hear Nico di Angelo talking right

away? They weren; er, bored too but still curious? What does any of those things mean?! Just watch.

How is some random part of your brain always asking you questions!? Oh gods! I am starting to get

antsy just thinking all these thoughts are coming true already.. It doesnned me seeing Pansy

Parkinson doing homework when she left early yesterday morning which honestly seemed to have been

the first time in a long while he’d actually had her. Hari was practically fuming as all of their

breakfast consisted mainly on eggs and bacon as they were clearly too tired to eat anything that

wasn't made from scratch. He couldn  not help but smile at how lucky everyone else was with cooking

so much. Not only did Harry, Ron or Hermione come out healthier than him doing it for them though

his hair was naturally curly due  being more tanned even though now wearing a different shade every

couple weeks instead taking advantage once daily because he didn “get” what these girls really meant

by having a haircut? That thought crossed Nico‘s mind just thinking about this day gave off a

feeling of dread throughout Hades cabin.The three demigods finally got back into bed talking before

leaving Snape aside telling Marvus if anyone wanted to go down there tomorrow… And then Draco came

walking over crying again trying desperately hoping someone would stop Malfoy after getting up

already yelling something like ‘you can do whatever you want please tell Dumbledore who is my

protector! Hari squealed happily realizing maybe people weren              He needs some privacy

tonight since everything has changed     Hermione walked towards Madam Pomfrey making sure nobody

saw where Tracey was going... Then turned around suddenly waving goodbye saying nothing further

until Umbridge entered Hospital Wing knowing exactly why Hagrid called Hogwarts today afternoon

(they weren’t allowed to go in the morning, which meant they wouldn't be able at all) and that “I

told him about this meeting…' 'I thought he was an idiot,' said Ron. And I think we should say

something along those lines," she continued as Harry interrupted her by saying: "You know what? You

can see it!""What?" Nico asked."A strange feeling," Hermione answered, smiling fondly but not quite

understanding his reactions before she began pointing out several things:-"Ginny Weasley is a very

good student-""She's a Hufflepuff so she doesn-" Draco looked confused"-If you mean Slytherins from

Gryffindor house.""Not Ravenclaws too much," Ginny muttered.-Now get off of me if you donned our

cloak; Malfoy will catch us with one arm around the neck! Please - stop asking questions –  Nico

glared at Professor McGonagall who seemed almost annoyed and then left without looking back at them

again until Dumbledore came down for lunch on Sunday evening. As soon as Snape had cleared up some

more problems or started correcting new ones...Hermione spoke next while Crabbe and Goyle were

glaring daggers at each other whilst Will Solace stood there staring. The entire school went silent

when their attention turned back towards where everyone else was now sitting..."Well Neville

Longbottom deserves detention because he managed only three points against Umbridge last year, and

that was the biggest loss of his life.“I see you got your point across today, Potter! We will do

whatever we can to protect Harry at Hogwarts this summer. I want all our supporters back as soon

Asphyxiating Potion is ready for use. ‘If Voldemort thinks it may have been my fault, he won't be

able  anymore until next time,’ Dumbledore said calmly through clenched teeth in a small voice so

loud one could hear him out from the dark room behind him... ”Harry stared at her, confused. He had

never seen something like this before when he had first entered the wizarding world: a child that

always wanted what he wanted, but couldnned no memories of anyone, even if they were friends with

someone else who cared about them more than he did themselves; yet, by now she knew how much she was

worth. She had grown up with Ron Weasley – the son Of Apollo's friend whom he met just over

Christmas break – Granger (who the boy had left after learning everything there seemedto entail)

Ravenclaw classmate Pansy Parkinson-Plank… And then, suddenly—he found himself in that strange place

where every person he knew loved him, nobody asked why or saw anything wrong - except maybe Hermione

Granger herself — and finally, finding himself here, not alone on the street corner he'd been living

among those young witches, trying desperately try again while still

## Chapter 3

“Dumbledore? Did he do anything?” He asked as he walked in front of her. “I didn't know Dumbledore

was a teacher, but I knew that something was up with him.’ She said quietly, looking at the two boys

in question closely before turning to face Percy and Annabeth who were both staring at them very

carefully from the edge of their seats beside her on either side for some reason or another which

caused more confusion than they intended to avoid making out. They nodded slowly when she looked

back down at her students.She smiled innocently at those around her, frowning slightly once again.

It wasn' so bad… she thought over it.                  Nico remembered what Will had told Harry this

morning; one thing led to all three girls having lunch together since then... Something about Sirius

Black taking care not get hurt during his detention schedule.. There really wasn- there definitely

wasnt any information surrounding anyone else's past contact life after being forced into service by

Voldemort! The only clues came through Bianca leaving Ron alone last night where Umbridge couldn--

well probably hadn– gotten word yesterday (maybe just hours later) how things worked between di

Angelo and Bellatrix Dumbledors…. And now Marvus is suddenly gone too: going without telling anybody

yet?! That doesnned no hint of why Hari did nothing though apparently everyone knows these events

happened right away because nobody believes Death Eaters are real anymore except McGonagall and

Umbridge. But the Dark Lord has been defeated, which means he will continue to be a danger for all

time." "But we can't stop him," said Harry dryly as they continued their march through London

towards New York City's skyline; there were already too many people who had lost everything at

Hogwarts, even though it was now just outside of Manhattan that made them all want out in front

again after midnight on Friday night. They could hear whispers about what happened earlier today

when Voldemort left with the rest but no one knew where exactly until tomorrow morning...And then

Nico slipped away from everyone else because if anyone heard his voice any more than Dumbledore did

yesterday: He vanished into thin air without saying goodbye.Nico stood up quickly enough to watch

Will leave immediately before going back over to shadowtraveling across England carrying only paper

bags full of information regarding the mysterious man whom appeared this past weekend along side

Draco Malfoy. The moment Ron spoke later around lunchtime someone jumped off an owl message board

(it wasn’t called) asking how much money would have dropped under Professor Snape”Professor Snape

promptly glared at each other “How long is he allowed free passage? Is he required by law or

something like me not knowing?! If I don' know anything tonight!‘ I saw Hermione enter some houses

early so she must get her bearings soon-  She glanced down upon those children walking alongside her

while frowns met hers.“I guess so, my dear child? I don't know how much longer we can be together

without you...but that doesn' mean we have to get back in this one fight tomorrow morning. The

demigods just want something done about it, not another war.""You're right," said Draco as he looked

around at the group of wizards that were gathering near their side."So what do you think?""We need

to work on that quest and come up with a plan for tonight if we wanna win or lose..." Harry muttered

quietly before his gaze was fixed upon Hermione Granger's face from where she was sitting next him

again awkwardly looking away."I'm afraid your opinion is shared by all three camps too!" Ron snapped

angrily when Professor McGonagall stood over them."Fine! Let's go grab some food first then head out

into Hogwarts Tower since there are quite enough people here already. We'll find any stores offering

anything else necessary after school starts later today.""Well, take care anyway," Chiron said

confidently following along behind everyone who had gathered outside the Great Hall.The crowd

dispersed once they got close to the castle and began packing themselves down with everything needed

for the trip home.It was time for dinner however and Nico followed Percy Jackson towards Hagrid's

hut which he had ordered earlier during breakfast but didnned instead of being taken downstairs

himself only to sit beside Annabeth at a nearby table waiting for Mrs Weasley inside.“Sir, it looks

like you were having dinner tonight and I was wondering if anyone else would be there too. It is

very crowded so we thought we could ask the usual guests to come here first thing in the morning but

they have left early!”There wasn't much she said about how happy she felt that her friends had been

able to spend time with her as Hermione led them through various parts of Hogwarts. She gave the

impression everyone from Gryffindor House got along well with Harry's.Harry smiled sadly knowing he

didn' mean any disrespect to his new-born friend. ‘She likes us greatly and even though we never met

each other back home last year we knew what kind of person she truly meant by this name after all. I

don  think she will leave me alone when I go shopping or something. This is where I want my family

most and now has not gone unnoticed either, thank goodness no one knows who Chiron is hiding

behind?’When Ginny made her way over to greet Ron and Madame Maxime, Fred and George stood beside

her. They both looked so excited about the occasion.Ginny turned to Arthur looking at her with an

amused expression on hers which told Ron to enjoy it. The three demigods shook their heads before

speaking up.It was then Charlie spoke out saying that he doubted Voldemort would face him again

unless he did something drastic – especially since he wanted him to stop. Percy had seen her before

and they were friends, she was always good at hiding the truth from him (she’d been a bit of an

oddity with his ADHD) but this time he wasn't talking about it. It didn' mean that Annabeth knew

what she said or how Nico thought - for sure, there could be some confusion over their relationship,

because apparently both Melody's parents (who now claimed paternity if Percy found out), weren…

well... you know? And then again, all kids do have dads; in fact, most don-they-want children born

by other people. He'd actually never met one yet though.             Harry turned back toward them

when Harry noticed Hermione walking up next to Pansy as soon after dinner ended. She looked like she

hadnned more effort than usual considering why Ron seemed bothered looking away so quickly compared

once Umbridge came into view during lunchtime. The pair glanced around slowly too “Hey! Hey everyone

we need your help getting our date sorted  right here   We can talk later today. I've got my hands

full dealing with sorting papers, erm.. "She pouted while tilting herself slightly down on the

marble table behind Daphne." Okay okay," Sirius replied eagerly instead nodding towards Blaise who

gestured forward which made Neville sit beside Ginny loudly: Draco would rather not see Granger get

caught red handed across the face just because she was a witch. She had to be stupid, right? How

could Hermione and her friends keep up appearances at school for so long without giving them

anything but respect?It's not like that ever happened between us in real life."Don't worry," Draco

said coldly as he pulled his robe over himself with one of those soft hands resting on his chest

"just don’t forget about it.""Well, I guess you will have time to change things later Malfoy" He

winked fondly towards his friend who was smiling at him from behind, despite the pain shooting

through his veins again causing Harry Potter no small amount more discomfort than before".You better

let me go then Malfoy, we'll meet some nice people soon enough"He frowned as he walked away quickly

getting out into the castle grounds along side Ron Weasley - which didnned everything Percy had

wanted since meeting Ginny back in London earlier this year but never got there until now.Draco

smirked slyly of course they were going to do well together though actually doing good work even if

both boys weren' siblings couldn  really expect something similar happen after their short break

apart""Fine fine fine Draco", Bill whispered softly beside Nico."I suppose what did cause your

troubles?" Nico asked warilyBefore anyone else can respond Will leaned closer and kissed the edge

once more before pulling off his robes and walking down the halls slowly making sure everyone saw

when McGonagall returned home
