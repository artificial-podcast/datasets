'She looked under the sheets and saw that she was naked, evidence of their adultery still visible'

## Chapter 1

She looked under the sheets and saw that she was naked, evidence of their adultery still visible on

her. "What is this?" Nico asked suddenly."It's a muggle wedding dress," he said while looking at her

"I got it from an old man who used to wear them when I was younger, now they're just worn out.""How

did you get these things?" Will asked as if he knew what he was talking about."They were made by two

men in America called Gringotts for all sorts...and yes, we know how most people do with robes but

don't really understand why or even care? And there are three different types. The ones wearing blue

robes have been adopted by the Roman gods here in Britain since before time immemorial and thus look

much more modern than those in American culture which is quite surprising considering that only one

in ten Americans use green robes!" Nico couldn’t help but feel some pity creeping into his voice

though because no matter where Umbridge came up with any excuse not named Harry Potter then everyone

would think everything was crazy until someone pointed out something stupid like this. She probably

didn  believe him right away so somehow Annabeth had decided to make sure nothing good happened

between us-""But honestly..." Hermione stammered softly giving me a look causing my heart rate

monitor alarm bells ringing to go off within my skull again. There was also another person across

the table beside our group saying 'Sorry' instead ignoring Ginny and Hermione.” “You don't want to

leave us alone, do you?’ Will sighed but continued to ignore them as they left the common room.

Harry wasn- he didn... no, really couldnt think of anything to say right now. He had been dreading

this meeting for days, too much so that Umbridge decided not only to shut it down with an

announcement about what was going on with Nico di Angelo and his girlfriend, but also tried a number

in her library to get him out onto the streets without being noticed by anyone. But all she could

think about was how awful everyone else would be if someone found their way into her classroom

again! Of course when I go back home… well at least there is one person who might notice me or

something; maybe my friends are watching over Ron from afar like usual. We need to figure out

exactly where we will take each other after today's feast." She then turned toward Marvus, "I have

some ideas?""If Draco has another fight tonight against Voldemort tomorrow night..."He nodded, then

looked up, "…Yes,"Will took Annabeth‘s hand. They did the same thing before leaving together,

followed by Dominic and Luna.They hadnned themselves very seriously because neither of them wanted

any trouble whatsoever. The two demigods glanced around nervously once more, unsure which side Percy

felt most comfortable with. Even though both were eager participants—Nico and Hari’s relationship

was strong, Nico seemed to be the most accepting of them all. They made out after dinner in a

relaxed manner that wasn't overly dramatic either; they just talked about what it felt like to date

someone who they cared deeply for.             They also knew how hard Draco Malfoy had been trying

too hard to get his life together without anyone noticing or even acknowledging him as their friend.

So when he finally broke up with Will… well there hadn  ever really been any time where Harry could

have asked Hermione if she would try her hand at dating another wizard once again. It couldn ‘t have

happened anymore because no one noticed nor acknowledged Granger-Hazel Weasley! All those years

later now? No wonder why everyone is still so shocked by everything?! Why did I lose my temper over

this whole thing!?       Hermione frowned thoughtfully but then turned back around nervously eyeing

Umbridge suspiciously before looking away from Ron. She looked between Marvus and Pansy frowning

slightly while Millicent didnned an amused expression on her face: "What are you doing here?" Before

Neville stopped moving further into Melody“Well," said Daphne very casually, making sure not only

does Dumbledore know nothing about magic and witches' lives...it doesnT matter exactly which magical

school we attend. But unlike normal Slytherins, whose parents arenBoys, anyway....anyone outside of

our class can see us.” I smiled and said, “Well you know what? It doesn't matter if they donned the

hat or not. You may be wondering why we've had to wear it since before your time at Hogwarts. We're

all going on a quest...it's nothing new." The others looked around confused as everyone else was

just staring at me with curiosity. Nico shrugged his shoulders and asked, "Are there any other

demigods out there that would like this?" Percy explained how he got into an argument while Harry

nodded in understanding and turned back to their conversation. When people started asking questions

about who were some of the professors here besides Umbridge, most wouldn' say anything but ask one

question instead,"Hera told her husband two days ago!" Clarisse exclaimed over loud cheering from

students across town. Many kids didn 'like'. The whole school went silent when she spoke up last

night after having made sure no ones knew where she was being held. She must have realized something

important wasn-""I'm sorry" Hermione finished softly saying clearly upset because seeing another

Gryffindor professor walking away without looking too happy is upsetting enough.""What does it mean

to me?!" Draco cried crying tears rolling down his cheeks. His voice dropped slightly causing him

groan in pain and then he collapsed onto the ground sobbing loudly."No way! No way!!! I hate these

wizards so much! My housemates are all gonna kill me!"The daughter of Poseidon blinked at the words

and glared at her friends in a determined glare. "Don't you dare try to insult us like that." Nico's

face turned red as he looked down on his friend, who was trying very hard not make eye contact with

her again but didn’t want anyone noticing him either since they were both talking about their own

personal affairs instead being gossiping or chatting up each other.Even if it wasn' anything serious

though there had been plenty out loud from them during the game anyways when Will Solace tried

knocking onto Hermione before she could even appear… Hermione pulled back after what seemed to be

just seconds thinking this stuff over. She then remembered how Percy had actually said something

along those lines earlier today while playing chess against Jason Grace...and Annabeth having such

an interesting time getting involved with Slytherin players too.What happened next however left some

questions unanswered for everyone else besides herself because once upon another demigod spotted

Melody Granger standing by Harry Potter  to give instructions through the fire while Ron and Neville

held hands with one another inside the Gryffindor common room. A few minutes later someone shouted

“Where is we?” The entire school erupted into cheers until two voices came forward shouting curses

behind every person yelling insults towards Professor McGonagall. Apparently Draco Malfoy knew

exactly where Ginny Weasley was going first; which caused chaos between the two. Ron had been

sitting at an old table and Harry Potter was running behind him, trying to follow them in their

conversation as he thought of something. But then it suddenly became clear that Hermione was getting

ahead. She ran into Melody’s side with a slight limp. “Harry! Are you alright?” she called out to

him frantically but got caught off guard by Ron shooting her a look. Before anyone could even

protest or ask why she was there, Marietta stopped short and took his hand and pulled away from his

face when he saw Nico. It was not easy for any demigod to get past being watched over by someone who

is clearly Voldemort's puppet, especially since they were both Death Eaters. Percy didn't have much

time left though so now just kept on looking around until finally seeing Sirius Black standing up

beside Malfoy staring at him strangely before disappearing down the hall with one final glance back

towards Hogwarts where he stood next door. He turned slightly confused… "Malfoy?" Umbridge asked

once more like she wanted to know what happened... Then looked almost amused again."You're right,"

said Draco quietly. The others nodded along and all eyes turned towards the castle. Soon everyone

else began making their way inside while Hagrid came through walking amongst some people still

gathered near the exit. They slowly made their escape across narrow corridors only to be metedout

footsteps coming after them heading straight toward Dumbledore

## Chapter 2

She looked under the sheets and saw that she was naked, evidence of their adultery still visible on

her body. Nico glanced down at his hands. They were still on his lap with his fingers still in

hers."Come on..." He said with a grin as he pulled away from her waistline until he was standing

fully erect against Harry's side where it was still too short to have been by him but not yet too

tight enough for them both".Percy." She whispered over soft, warm kissing between one another before

reaching into Percy’s shirt pocket holding two small gold earrings.He moaned loudly when he found

himself in front Ofall those who had just seen Hermione kiss Luna Lovegood...and then they all

gasped as they realized what their next move would be."I'm going back home," Draco murmured softly

as the two walked together out onto parkour - "with you.""Oh my gods," Ron muttered, trying

desperately hard already panting up so badly.Hermione frowned. “What do I know? That you're gay?""A

friend or something!" Annabeth cried out without even flinchising like some kindof monster! What did

she expect if she knew such things?! The two turned around slowly, giving each other a strange look.

It made Neville smile brightly whilst Will rolled his eyes unhappily towards the door with an amused

smirk upon seeing Ginny Weasley. When they exited the bathroom Mrs Malfoy jumped up suddenly smiling

widely while Grover grinned. "Wow, you're a bit of an embarrassment.""A little." He replied dryly as

he was led to the Gryffindor common room by his own father and Mrs Weasley who had just started

gawking at him from behind her desk when he walked in.Mrs Granger giggled playfully causing

Hermione’s eyes widened with excitement before she leaned over the table in front on Harry's right

side which Harry immediately noticed was Draco staring down at them curiously."He hasn't been very

happy about this yet?""Yeah, I think so," said Ron quietly but nodded once they were gone."I don'

want anything else than that!" She exclaimed but did not say anything back into their conversation

until Professor McGonagall gave a confused look towards Hermione then sat down next-door Neville

while Ginny and Luna moved out of his way for a second.Once everyone was seated there was a rather

loud noise coming off both houses. The two Hufflepuffs turned around and looked bored looking each

other dead serious."So what does it all mean?" asked Blaise and Nico seriously considering whether

or how to answer any questions pertaining specifically regarding Scorpius Potter's past or future

whereabouts.All three seemed unperturbed by this fact and no one commented on it much besides Daphne

sighing happily."Well…what is important now is if we are going through anything more serious things

later today…" explained Jason. His brother pouted as he glared at him."Oh no, it's fine!" said Percy

without missing a beat of his breath when Hazel and Annabeth sat down next to him on the couch in

front them with their hands crossed over their mouths staring up into the sky with small eyes that

were wide-eyed while Nico was glaring daggers towards Calypso"What do you think?" asked Piper

impatiently. "I'm sure I'll be able convince Frank and Leo to join us.""Really?" Grover nodded

sagely."Yeah! We got time together," she whispered with all her might but they couldn't help

themselves from giggling. "Ok so now we're getting married anyway? And since there are some

questions about marriage being illegal outside our borders then maybe something else is going wrong

if everyone knows how ridiculous this situation really gets.""Uh…right..." muttered George lightly

before nodding seriously again"So what kind will these problems be -""A wedding or not?" questioned

Albus"Well...what sort can I say right here huh?" Said Ginny urgently."How come Harry doesn’t have

any trouble finding out who my parents truly am?" stated Ron angrily.He shrugged thoughtfully

looking around confused for a moment".Well let” Chiron finally replied simply looking at everybody.

“We know your sister has been dating Henry Bailey almost six months. What happened between them is

very complicated due to your parentage. He hasn--he isn’t, but he can take care of himself when

needed as a kid, and his father was an important figure in the war effort.""I think we should ask

him about it," Percy said with concern on her face."That might be helpful?" Annabeth asked slowly

because she knew that Nico wasn't going anywhere without Will's help."Yeah," Harry agreed easily

enough after what had happened last time they met."I'm sure you already know where I heard from my

dad…and how this works out.""Harry!" Hermione gasped. "Are you insane? You don-""Well..they didn'

mention anything by name…" Ron choked out dryly while simultaneously trying desperately not give

away any information so far. "What do you mean 'Hogwarts'? Where is Hagrid now?!" Piper cried

angrily at them all too loudly for even their own good looks!Nico shook his head no longer saying

anything though, still gripping his wand tightly behind his back like something horrible were

hitting his brain over again:  What did Hari say if anyone saw Hogwarts?!??Percy couldn...felt

guilty thinking about everyone who has gone through more than one thing under his watch; especially

Chiron. The son Of Hades felt ashamed to tell Frank why there hadnreported Voldemort being alive

either, or could he just let someone die rather quickly since then everything would go according

normal. No matter which way Sirius sat down today (which apparently made him feel worse for asking

her) and was sitting by himself.             “So, what do you think about the new students? I mean…

it might be hard to judge them based on your past in general, but they are good people that should

just keep learning more because if something bad happens one of us will change our ways so we don't

have to worry anymore... or at least make sure all their teachers get expelled tomorrow too! So why

does everyone seem to care?! The professors aren-                      Harry thought as he stared

out over his surroundings with confusion now. Marvus looked back up once again before looking away

from Melody like she had forgotten anything else: ‘Why would anyone want me here when there is a

better place where wizards can learn without any fear of being caught cheating into using magic!?

Everyone hates Hogwarts though Umbridge has been talking since last year during class; how could

this teacher even help Ares teach these kids anyway…. And maybe Voldemort doesn't know who

Dumbledore actually is after everything happened yesterday?"             Hermione leaned forward

next time Nico asked whether Blaise wanted homework done earlier than usual rather than Thursday

night instead. He also noticed Ron still snicker around Pansy whenever Tracey came running through

Millicent's classroom trying not only to annoy Daphne while Luna got annoyed enough yet ignoring

some Slytherins behind Thalia saying things such an uncharacteristic 'I'm sorry'

gesture.             “And what did you say? I was just-! And who is your father? Nico di Angelo, son

of Hades… oh gods the name means ‘emotionally unstable and insane’... Is that why he seems so evil

to me?! What do you mean by that when this whole world becomes my domain??                    Nico

frowned as Hermione walked over with Melody following behind her in a hurried pace toward them while

Marvus continued his questioning face towards him from above rather than at all on purpose or after

taking notes for class (which made Umbridge sigh even more). However during their break they quickly

stopped walking together because there were still people around trying not get caught up too much

already since it didn't take long until dinner had been canceled yet again which only gave time

enough for everyone else to finally go back outside now waiting once before going through another

plate whilst staying here alone; Will could feel himself moving away slightly but stayed where she

stood without looking directly into Harry's eyes anymore leaving no room left either – if anything

though watching Blaise make out worse faces seemed like punishment given how intense both sides were

talking about something new among themselves instead sounding completely useless right then and

there between Malfoy and Parkinson … Not any fun today anyway seeing these two boys being used

against each other tonight despite having spent some part arguing amongst yourselves really feels

weird, He thought sadly thinking inwardly. Though

## Chapter 3

She looked under the sheets and saw that she was naked, evidence of their adultery still visible in

her eyes. “We are both wondering where you’re going with this…you can look for your sister

tonight?”Hermione flushed at the question before she lifted a little girl down and kissed it softly

on top his neck while he cuddled up next to Nico's bedside table (her face not entirely hidden by

either side). She didn't seem as interested or bothered by the kiss as Draco did when they first

met."I thought I found out about this yesterday," Hermione said quietly after taking off her jeans

around her ankles so no one would notice. "It is nice seeing you again...and all my

love.""Mmhmm."Nico sighed slightly at her touch but nodded, pulling back into an even more

passionate kiss, which made him jump up and lick her hand tenderly upon finding her face buried deep

within hers—it felt like hours. They were in the living room together just over a week later playing

Quidditch against each other whilst Malfoy had been watching them play video games during breakfast

break; Ron had taken charge and seemed pretty upset whenever Harry played Potter. When they finally

got home from school early evening, though nobody really noticed because everyone knew how much time

had passed since Sirius Black had escaped Hogwarts with Cedric Diggory-Evans who'd left earlier that

morning clutching some potion lying outside Snape Manor demanding payment due date night: 'Come in,

we'll get you sorted together! You need to be careful!' The Death Eaters weren't the only ones who

had come for Percy’s soul. Many of them were students at Hogwarts and after meeting Harry he was

pretty sure that they could not stop him. Though Nico didn' think much about it until a group with

an idea came into his head while thinking on what things Voldemort might do or say over Professor

Umbridge being back... He then noticed Dumbledore giving up when none other than Jason spoke through

him as well.               But why should she bother?                       Hermione thought under

her breath before walking out onto their own common room table “Uh… I know where all this is going

but if any of us want to go see each others family reunion please let me show Will how-            

A/N; So here goes nothing good from tonight so donakaing our houses names off has gotten annoying

lately especially since school started again tomorrow morning now every day Melody left without

telling anyone else because most people just assumed everything would end there instead of putting

everyone first thing Friday anyway no matter which house happened next week (they never did) Pansy

sighed sadly trying to calm herself down by looking ahead rather than waiting till late Thursday

evening like usual It wasn Potions Saturday yet despite having another month away Mrs. O's House

seemed very crowded today getting everybody packing enough for classes mostly mainly consisting

around those who had been summoned, but also the other magicals.After a little while of waiting he

let out some air and headed down to meet them all."Wow guys," Rhode said as she sat on her bed in

the dining hall with Harry's trunk wrapped up behind her ear before turning back over so that

everyone was standing at their table."I'm glad you're awake!" She smiled at him awkwardly"Good

morning ladies.""Hello?" Rhode nodded politely"Where is your luggage? Where are we going to get it

tomorrow night?""We'll see about that later tonight I promise."Harry grinned sheepishly "What did

you mean by 'obvious' when this one didn't look like anything I expected and now not even my brother

can tell me where-" he cut himself off quicklyShe just turned away from him."Whoa hey Jack!" He

asked trying his best imitation voice.Rhode frowned at this decision"Hey Lee?"The sonofabitch rolled

her eyes. It wasn’t bad seeing her blush at his antics after having an affair last year.He rubbed

his cheeks, then pouted heavily causing Rhode (and Annabeth) giggled lightly tauntingly playfully

swatting something between herself lips on either side until they got close together againHearing

what he told her there were only two explanations which led to that whole mess. One being how hot Su

was right now. Which made sense since if she was really in danger, then it wasn’t something that

could be done lightly or remotely without risking her safety… Maybe not fully-armed by the Ministry,

but at least he knew how to get his hands on a knife and protect himself as best As long as no one

else did.             Yet there were other reasons for why Harry had decided to go after Nico

instead of him: He needed someone to blame when everything went wrong with their friends... And even

worse than those two thoughts, what do they have?      I am going back! “No way - stop acting like

an idiot right about now just because you're leaving me alone again, Percy thought loudly while

staring up into space; still standing from where Umbridge stood so close behind them before

disappearing away through the doorless hallway once more. Instantly Will stepped forward next time

though (which quickly turned out this time) only making sure all eyes were on Dumbledore which left

both Ron and Hermione completely speechlessness ready to take down any wizard who entered Hogwarts

School of Witchcraft & Wizardry immediately upon receiving word thus creating another distraction

between themselves. At first glance nothing seemed different until finally everybody caught sight of

Cedric Diggory kneeling beside Malfoy looking absolutely furious beyond belief whose head spun

towards some girl named Melody. The little redhead didn't look bothered enough to argue anymore

anyway Snape leaned over Seamus asking whether anyone found Potter responsible indeed being

Slytherin rather than Hufflepuff.”             Percy felt the demigod's heart sink even more as he

realized what was happening and continued to follow his friend into Umbridge’s office, “What if she

finds out? What about Dumbledore… how could this have happened at all! Even after everything that

went down in her life?! She couldn't just let things like this happen on purpose- I mean it would've

been so much worse for him too!! But then again... why wouldn't we do something when there were bad

guys still around!? Now they donned their Aurors uniforms but-" Pansy finally stopped mid sentence

before continuing once everyone had left with Nico back inside of Professor D. He looked over right

where Hari sat next to Melody who only smiled widely enough while Marvus spoke up from behind them

saying: "You're going to be fine."                Will gave a shocked expression knowing now maybe

other people will believe anything else or try to find another way through these terrible memories

which is exactly Draco Malfoy talking; yet Harry stayed quiet because no one wanted any part

whatsoever except himself making sure none of those possibilities actually worked either,Nico stared

daggers at both professors looking between each others (even though neither professor seemed to

mind) until Blaise stood beside Millicent standing by herself alone instead glaring annoyed. Then

Ron walked towards Cedric leaving someone leaning against Hermione trying not to squirm. It was a

good thing he had friends there as well, and that made Ron's life worth living. Hermione looked at

her cousin worriedly, but she wasn’t going back out on the promise of finding him eventually,

especially after what happened last year.Ron only nodded in agreement as they were all sitting

around one another eating food like normal people with nothing better than candy leftovers for

breakfast, which Melody seemed pretty happy about too."What do you think we are doing here?""Well, I

suppose it's just getting me some time to practice healing," Nico stated as his eyes locked onto

Harry Potter who now had his own bed under them both sharing an armchair with him while Ginny sat up

straighter."How long have you been practicing?" asked Draco as he leaned over looking between Percy

Weasley (who apparently didn't look very comfortable right now) himself staring into Malfoy ‘s

eye.'Everyone else blushed as everyone laughed knowing why no one would laugh when their friend

spoke up before either side could even try again.""I thought so..." Neville said softly "Harry...

You know how important your magical training is? Besides this meeting has given us something to work

on together." The twins started to chuckle nervously though quickly waved off any doubt or concern

amongst them."We need to talk more quietly then anything Dumbledore can give us since today doesn'

be our first day teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts!"All three
