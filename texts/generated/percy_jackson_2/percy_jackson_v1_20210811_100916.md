'“Don’t you realize what we have done?” Hermione said, pacing up and down the bedroom'

## Chapter 1

“Don’t you realize what we have done?” Hermione said, pacing up and down the bedroom. “The three of

us are doing something stupid like this…and now that our quest is over, they can do anything with

us!‘It was a pity my mom didn't bring me in to get her memories back; she's already been through

enough with Harry as well."Harry nodded before he started to walk towards Ron again,"Are there any

other things I need?" Nico asked quietly. "What about your friends? How many times did Annabeth cry

because Percy couldn' help it?!"Hermione giggled at him funny how hard Will had tried not to scream

for them. It was embarrassing talking their way out so fast but seeing all those happy smiles on his

face made no difference."You know where Luke went wrong after killing Thanatos last time.""I hope

Hecate wouldnned everything when she found Leo..." Ginny mumbled as Frank stood next behind

Neville"Hey look who knows if Kronos has another plan!" Fred exclaimed amusedly while Dean looked at

everyone else, then quickly followed suit with two pairs from each house."And why does anyone care?!

You guys just ruined Camp Half-Bloods by leaving people here during battle with nothing better than

bloodthirsty monsters!"Percy shrugged uncomfortably"As much fun as camp might be without you guys,

Mr Jackson, let's go see Piper or Jason-" They ran into more skeletons than they ever had before,

including one of the other students who was probably a ghost. The two demigods started running

towards them."Why would anyone do that?" Ron asked as he walked over to Percy and Nico with a raised

eyebrow.Percy nodded in understanding at his friend's question but still smirked like an idiot for

letting something go so quickly."I just thought I'd let you know about this," He said coldly while

holding out a hand apologetically "The whole thing is kinda cute.""Really? That's funny!" Hermione

exclaimed"Just kidding! They're talking about ghosts now..." she snapped back.Harry shook himself

from his thoughts. "Yeah... whatever. But it's pretty cool when we can trust eachother because

sometimes things get tough around here too."“What are you guys doing up there?” Ginny questioned

“Are you going to be okay today though? You really need to help us defeat Voldemort if we don't win

tomorrow night. We could never possibly lose tonight… And what better way then by fighting him alone

on your own turf against a bunch OF demi-gods instead?!’As soon As Harry turned ten seconds later

everyone else already knew why their friends were asking questions again. Both Annabeth (who hadn't

bothered looking after her younger sister) got off laughing along side McGonagall. Draco looked

absolutely adorable watching Rachel chuckling behind herself grinning maniacally.“Not many girls

want to date a girl of their own age, but I mean… well we all know that Jay has been dating for

years now and hasn't made it past the first round anyway; so you'd think he'd be able get along with

Nico in time, maybe even if he didn' have to worry about getting dumped because people were gonna

see him as 'too hot'.”Nico shrugged though before continuing on. ‘Well how do we fix that? If they

don- er.. not at least make sure there are no more demigods left out or having too much sex going

into the year... what kind of girls would actually appreciate one of us being around?!’XXThe next

day came closer than expected when Will stopped by Draco‬s table carrying his things from last

night. When Harry asked Ron where Theo was tonight Jason looked up eagerly inquisitively seeing

everyone staring at him with genuine concern.Harry saw Percy take off after them walking down the

corridor towards Professor Umbridge․Slytherin Tower which Hermione watched closely leaving Melody‾s

face completely blank excepting her gaze.Will however nodded quickly grabbing onto Ginny‼s arm

holding her tightly knowing she wouldnt resist anything. After dinner finally Mrs Weasley got back

together once again giving Bianca a stern look asking why did this girl need to go home early

today!? Hermione couldn  not help but feel a bit cheated. It was the reason why she’d always taken

Percy seriously as an eleven year old, even if he wasn't that good at it. So when they finally came

out of the dormitories in late June or early July and began their homework to get ready for what

would be on her mind every day, Hermione found herself struggling with figuring out how to survive

without Harry. She didnned a fake copy today—she could have easily written one tomorrow night--and

started studying hard again too; despite being under so much pressure from school, having such

little time alone gave up everything else to focus solely upon classwork. When Will arrived just

after lunch instead (the whole exam schedule) Hermione had been thinking about all those times Ron's

already gotten himself into trouble by trying his best impersonator skills over some random idiot

wizard named Sirius Black. How did he know? He kept getting more questions than Ginny ever got

back...at least until now. And then Annabeth asked them later: "Did you want your wand?" Nico turned

around suddenly and smiled widely. The younger girl blinked twice and nodded once. Then she looked

away. Her arms wrapped around him tightly while she stared blankly at the other two boys, who were

staring wildly at her. Well…no question. They really don' want to talk about this. “Uh, yeah, I

guess we should go see where there are weird potions coming!� he asked and Hermione shook her

head.Percy frowned at the demigods who were trying to hide behind his back. “I guess it doesn’t

matter, but what about you?” He demanded as they moved towards him and Percy‘s eyes widened slightly

before it vanished and all four of them sprinted out of the castle. It was only when Nico started to

panic that Ginny didn't react first or she wouldn-she ignored everything else that happened around

her. Once everyone had settled into their new places on the grounds Harry began pacing nervously for

a moment before stopping once again and turning away from Ron and Luna. After hearing Annabeth's

question though many people turned very curious in surprise watching with wonder how this could have

happened."Well we don  happen here," Draco mumbled while smirking widely as one of his friends

laughed at him loudly.Ron looked confused until Neville let loose a clang which caused both boys'

eyebrows furrowing together tightly even more unnervingly then usual."Yeah?""No!" Melody said

nonchalantly "I think I know exactly why.""What is it? Are you crazy?" Fred questioned almost

angrily; so much tension hadn appeared at Hogwarts now that most of its students knew each other

well enough already.Hermione nodded slowly knowing if Malfoy just got upset by talking about

something stupid like wizarding stuff would quickly subside after seeing Granger do it too. She made

a large gash in the back of her head that she had to help fix up. They were both standing there,

blood on their hands and legs."Malfoy!" Hermione said sharply as she came down from behind. "I need

you all here. I promise I'll keep them safe."Ron snorted at this but got no response."But we can't

leave if they're-" Percy started as he saw Malfoy tie Ginny's hair together with his robes again

while Harry and Ron stared off into space. He took another deep breath before muttering something

under one arm (which was probably what caused the mess).The Weasley twins sat across from him

talking quietly, giving each other looks like Draco did."It is going well," Nico whispered

nervously. The two boys looked over towards Jason who seemed even more confused than usual as

Dumbledore opened the door for Will.""We know when people go wrong...""You mean...when your brother

ran away?" Frank asked innocently."Yeah, yeah..." George cut himself off as everyone turned to stare

at him strangely; neither would be able or willing not staring directly into Dumbledore’s eyes. “I

thought our leader will tell us later tonight why? You always seem so stoic sometimes…well, let me

try and explain things once Rhode went missing..please don' think about it forever-""No! There are

hundreds out here now, kids--they just aren  going easy

## Chapter 2

“Don’t you realize what we have done?” Hermione said, pacing up and down the bedroom. “We are going

to kill us first, in order that Voldemort doesn't get a chance at our lives.‘If he

does…‗             Melody looked away from Harry while Ron followed behind her as she glanced back

toward Melody. Then Marvus started laughing with his legs dangling out of bed frames again. He then

turned towards Nico di Angelo; it was apparent who had caught him last before everyone else returned

their attention once more. The son-of Hades appeared surprisingly calm without any emotion on his

face or expression.      ____________________NICO DI ANGELO NONE OF US FOUND HERE TO BE COMMENTATED

ABOUT AND READ THE MOST LANGUAGE HAD IN A VERY SOPING WORLD IS THAT OUR FAMILY HEAT WAS TRULY

GOVERNING FROM THEIR OWN POV! WE'RE DUMBLED UP ALL OVER AGAINST EVERYTHING WRONG WITH BECAUSE IT

REALLY JUST WERE KIND OF NOTHING BUT ANOTHER PURE THING THEY DID HAVE THROUGHOUT THIS YEARS LIFE! I

NEVER GET ANY SMART OTHERS QUICKLY NOW AS HELL!!! WHY DO YOU LET ME DOWN?! WHEN ARE YOU EVER SUCHA

GOOD TIME SO FAR?"The demigod didnned a small smile now but there was no malice anywhere in Will‡s

eyes. Maybe, maybe not. It was like the son of Hades only had to see a few things and watch them all

explode into so much more than he could handle. Percy's face lit up with excitement when his friends

took turns playing Quidditch against each other. “I am excited! I can't wait to finally play Harry

Potter again…this year we won-we need it!"  Nico muttered as they walked back out onto their own

field. After sitting through practices for over an hour, Umbridge spoke about something she knew:

her dream that Sirius Black appeared before everyone at Hogwarts...and how Dumbledore found him dead

after Voldemort had killed everything within his domain. "It is my understanding that you will be

studying Potions," said Dumbledore hastily, turning around to glance towards Ron Weasley. At first,

Hermione didnned some robes but eventually changed most immediately. She turned away from the rest

while staring at Ron, who looked suspiciously ill, and down between her two hands where Ron used

magic on himself."What are you doing here?" asked Melody absentmindedly"You haven_t been practicing

since Friday night because this morning your memories were taken by accident," Dumbledore began

sternly shoving Snape inside the Great Hall without waiting for any explanation whatsoever or even

looking very concerned for anyone else standing outside.Percy grumbled under his breath beside Madam

Pomfrey; if anything happened…he would have felt guilty. He stood in front of the door, with a

familiar smile on his face. The others were waiting outside that door too...they all seemed to be

busy talking as they waited for Nico and Will’s reaction to finally be made public.             They

had already spent some time together after school ended (as it was now), so maybe this might have

been something bigger than what Melody could see if she didn't try to cover up everything about him

being gay or not feeling like he deserved someone else's approval during the game?

  Harry thought back once more when Hermione appeared at dinner before them holding an orange cake

from her plate without looking away over herself until there weren- “Umbridge is making me promise I

won' say anything! You know how important Umbrings are because no one can get close to you unless

told otherwise by professors?! Well then we need to talk first thing tomorrow morning!" She said

excitedly "Wait till everyone gets home," Ron called out toward Draco who grinned widely but nodded

nonetheless grabbing another slice: Daphne immediately frowned pouting loudly while Pansy rolled

onto Tracey smiling broadly confused instead of happy."Daughter of Hades..." Snape snarled; suddenly

everybody watched instantly including himself leaving quickly realizing their mistake again yet

still ignoring Dumbledore telling Marvus nothing new came forward rather quick enough just moments

later di Angelo got caught trying very hard to steal Cho Chang off Voldemort right into the middle

of his trap. She was obviously going down a dark path, she was definitely not an idiot.But in return

for saving her life, Nico had allowed him all three demigods free to go home and spend time with

their families. He’d given them too much food and they‘d just eaten so much it“didn't make sense

that you would have sacrificed anything on that quest?”Nico shrugged. “I think I know where things

are headed…well at least let me tell you what happened back in America before we left...The other

one died after he tried helping Dumbledore kill Voldemort! And then Snape gave up trying

again?!†            Hades sighed as well but didn-  don             In spite Pansy couldn — did

something happen here or another there either way..it wasnned Hades weirdness making those thoughts

clear once more since this whole thing started out like normal without even bothering about Hestia's

actions first (although still awkward). Thus Hari began calling attention towards Umbridge from

behind Daphne who looked very annoyed when Seamus asked if someone else saw everything happening

over breakfast today only because some girl appeared earlier than usual anyway by accident while

others seemed to be discussing how many people were missing yesterday evening along side

Hermione(who got embarrassed seeing Malfoy walking past looking shocked) mostly messing around

talking amongst themselves until Millicent finally showed everyone why Hagrid was a son of Apollo

and that she had become a sister to him.             “But if he does not, then who is? And how can

we trust the people around him because they will know more than anyone else about this strange man-

oh wait! What are you talking?! Do it now as soon I tell them everything… Nico wants me to go back

in time... Then Pansy won't be able see what happened when Dumbledore turned up again; there isn'

going any way for her to get out alive or anything like that….       As Draco waited with Hermione

on his other side—she wasn ‘t saying too much anymore.' Why would Hades do such a thing since

Voldemort has already been defeated by Lucius Malfoy once before so many Death Eaters have died from

their wounds after being captured at the Battle Of Hogwarts?' The demigod thought blankly while

sighing heavily next word onto Harry's lips."I'm sure Hecate knows something terrible," Ron said

coldly even though nothing could possibly happen between Will Solace and himself knowing exactly

where Umbridge went wrong (he didn 'know', either). "Just try telling someone.""Whatever!" Marvus

yelled loudly through clenched teeth clearly displeased over having no reason given whatsoever to

continue trying interfere with magic anyway.After all those years without using spells except

Quidditch, both Luna Lovegoods and Melody Weasley were gone within two days.The night before

Halloween, when Voldemort was waiting for his victims to be killed in a ritual that he hadn't been

able yet—he woke up screaming in the bed of Malfoy Manor with Harry Potter dead on top him while

Nico di Angelo tried desperately not talk or cry in pain as everyone else was sobbing, but just

barely."You're alive!" Ron exclaimed, calling out from across hall where all four Death Eaters had

gathered. "What's going through your head?"Nico looked down at the back pages again; there they

stood: one page labeled 'Grimm', another describing what would happen if Riddle managed himself

somehow - which meant Riddles was doing something wrong!Then everything went black...Narcissa knew

she needed help somewhere down there but couldn’t afford it right now. He was being held by

Voldemort because he didn “really want anyone watching me.”He turned around to look at her...and saw

Will standing beside him and smiling. The ghostly boy snickered so hard this time that Draco almost

lost him altogether (except for Will who thankfully saved him). Nico opened his eyes wide once more

hoping that someone might find them; then suddenly he found Annabeth sitting next towards his

side.Nervous tears fell over her face like raindrops falling onto herself too many times during

their day together--for some reason Hermione seemed oblivious about what was happening to Nico and

started crying

## Chapter 3

“Don’t you realize what we have done?” Hermione said, pacing up and down the bedroom. “We know that

Cedric is dead, so I can‘t be sure if he was killed by a Death Eater or not… but there are other

possibilities! Besides Harry, Dumbledore would have been extremely suspicious of any interference

with his son-in law•Hermione started to move towards Nico and waved her wand at him again – Draco

looked ready for something else. He opened the door in front them quickly before going back inside,

shutting it behind him as well; after catching sight they all turned around on their feet."You two

need some time alone," Ron said quietly."What do your friends think?" Ginny asked softly. "Is this

about me, or my mother-" she trailed off out into space when Nico spoke."Nico's got an army under

control now..."Draco nodded once more... "I mean, how could someone like Voldemort kill us three

weeks ago?!""No one knows where Voldemort has gotten himself, exactly!" Luna exclaimed from her spot

next to Percy Jackson - who seemed just finishing talking.Harry thought very hard then: What

did this guy really want? Who should be planning such elaborate plans!?How dare these wizards attack

our school?! Why am    anyone even paying attention here?Why does every single person freaking care

why will ANYONE notice Malfoy attacking Hogwarts??He must've noticed Annabeth Potter watching

everything happen too, didn't she?”            Nico nodded. It was almost like he felt something

moving in his chest and that it had been a very long time since they have done this before the

Slytherin girls started to notice him…  Harry did indeed see them; Melody still watched as Percy

walked over with her back against Ron's shoulder while Hermione just stood there silently reading

some book from Ravenclaw Common Room or studying textbook after another girl began to speak up about

what happened yesterday when everyone else stopped talking because of all the things going on around

Hogwarts….                     What is so special here now... I am not supposed be able do anything

by myself anymore! How could someone even care if my magic has gone out without me knowing?! This

isn-this whole world ending!! Not only can we protect each other again but our lives will go down

any second no matter how hard you try your best (I know why Draco would want us together). Maybe

someday once more Nico wouldn'e let himself get used into worrying for Will during these difficult

times......but at least then Hecate won winced harder than ever waiting patiently inside Marvus who

finally said goodnight enough to stop crying later today.. well maybe next month might make those

days better huh? No way, especially right away such sorrows are annoying sometimes. Okay wait till

tomorrow night first thing always means getting changed off DADA “Hermione please!” She shouted

angrily as she was dragged out of the room.Draco sat there stunned for a moment before his eyes

glazed over, and he looked down at his sister in shock: a tear leaking from her eye but nothing

else...She screamed again.“Please Draco...I don't know what I'm supposed to do with this!

Please…why? Why did you even leave me here?! Don't touch anything stupid-what happened?! Who am we

going back to? We can go now if you want—but not tonight; that’s all it is so long as you stay away

Harry-you need to stop being such an idiot! You are my little brother and your family needs to know

that! If they ever have reason enough or cause to think otherwise about telling us our parents were

killed by Dementors...we will help them find them once and for  forever until they tell us who you

really care about, then come join us tomorrow evening wherever you might be. We won--‘We could save

lives like everyone deserves -if we just let Hermione live alone….–                 Will

wasn________________�the one person Nico couldni‬ve helped make into a real friend after everything

happening behind him when Umbridge left Hogwarts last summer (he got suspicious because Voldemort

didnInstantly forgot Melody), no matter how much time passed since seeing those three demigods

together. They had been on the run for a while now, trying to figure out who they were and what they

could do. Nico finally managed it with Will. "Hey," he said softly. There was something about his

voice that made him want more than anything else. The only thing keeping them from finding

themselves in this situation wasn’t himself anymore but their friends. He smiled at Ron when Harry

pulled up behind Percy so they would be able to talk earlier rather then later as well."I don't know

how long I can last without you guys around," Annabeth said as she headed over to her bedside table.

She sat beside Hermione, sitting next just past Ginny's. When there was no one near or close enough

to hear of where two people stood apart, everyone began walking back into Ravenclaw

Tower.            The others didn “wait?” Melody asked hesitantly before following after some other

girls towards Hogsmeade Station. All four except Thalia looked surprised by everything going through

both groups. However, Hazel gave an encouraging nod which caused Blaise not too much annoyance

within Hogwarts itself… apparently Hari isnned being part Gryffindor house girl during school

holidays even though most students still see Tracey play Quidditch under the tree line until late

summer because if all went accordingto plan...              It might have started off very quickly

like usual between Hufflepuffs, as Neville and Dean had arrived a few minutes before. The group

looked at each other suspiciously."So how did you know about that whole school thing?" said Draco

with a laugh again in his voice,"Harry knew we were related by blood," he gestured towards the

twins, "and I was just wondering if it was possible to get out of detention without getting

caught.""Oh well now let's go find her then - she'll be alright after all!""Yes ma'am-"Nico frowned

at Harry who still seemed confused but agreed instantly."What do ya mean, no point looking for her

right away..."Said Hermione with an amused look on her face. "She didn't even tell us where Ginny

lives or why they came up here so fast! We're gonna have our own separate house next time

instead-""Weasley is probably already there too...we could use another teacher first since Rhode has

been busy elsewhere," Ron shot back accusingly as Jason took their spot beside him. Neville made eye

contact wands with Nico and grinned widely at them while Snape smiled faintly when he saw what

everyone else gave his best guess. He thought Malfoy would show some interest because perhaps

something might work? Maybe someone from the Ministry wasn’t sure…Maybe Granger wouldn  see things

differently than this. But not until Professor McGonagall asked more questions later tonight

afternoon.-Ron chuckled darkly behind himself talking about Sirius Black and Percy

Jackson.            Harry didn’t even bother to look at the demigod as he watched Will do his

homework, though Nico did want a break from it too… Just like before when they had taken their time

together in bed... then suddenly there was this weird feeling of dread that escaped them while doing

so much work on Potions- all after taking some breaks? It felt nice! Why is Snape still here?! That

would explain why Harry couldn't see him anymore now but Umbridge always seemed to be trying to get

rid or rather intimidate Draco over something such by changing how she treated other students

without any reason whatsoever…. He tried not seeing her again since Malfoy left with everyone else

except for Ron who wasnned out during lunchtime because nobody really wanted those two Slytherins

back today either; which caused more problems than anything being Hermione going missing until

Professor McGonagall came looking through what happened last year instead of just having Dumbledore

tell everybody everything yesterday morning first thing tomorrow evening (which meant no one knew if

Hogwarts were destroyed). There weren  anyone around anyway — Fred and George Weasley found Hagrid's

trunk overnight whereupon Neville looked up frantically thinking someone must have woken Hedwig down

outside Bagman Tower somewhere off street corner.... And finally Bianca stayed awake reading an

article coming into Hufflepuff Common Room saying goodnight once people learned Moody hadn' t

returned yet......                 “Potter
