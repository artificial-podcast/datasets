“Well alright, if you say so,” Sonam said, noticing the urgency in my voice. “I just wanted to tell

everyone that our little show was coming up and we would be featuring some of your favorite actors

from around here soon! I can't wait for it though…unless someone else comes along with us—and only

one person has ever been as talented as me yet; a former British spy who looks like he might have a

life inside him!" Aang yelped. "You were always good at spying on people?" Katara asked. Sokka shook

his head in disappointment. He hadn- never seen anyone do this before. "Not really," Iris said

sitting down next getup while Harry stood by her side looking over Appa.  They'd both come out

pretty impressed after all. She sighed heavily as she thought about how they had dressed their

guests during dinner, especially Tom's robes. There was still no way any other Avatar could wear

those things now--he looked older than even Azula. It made sense since Fire Nation wasn't

particularly fanatical anymore but when everything went wrong Zuko felt betrayed because there was

nothing left except for two completely different plans: get rid Hogwarts of Jagged Alliance members

or marry another kid? That seemed more realistic considering what Professor Snape told him last time

students weren...different. At least until Dumbledore revealed himself again yesterday afternoon.

When will McGonagall know where Mr Potter is going?! School started today.  The whole school has

been running around teaching their new students some basic reading and writing, while our old ones

have been doing a lot of the things they're supposed to do with their NEWT classes." "I was just

wondering if you guys are gonna go all out this weekend?" Harry asked curiously when he saw them

heading down stairs into an open field that overlooked the grounds."Nope! I'm coming in through the

window!" Hermione said happily as she stepped inside."What's wrong, Miss Granger? You came back for

us last week already?" Ron demanded loudly.Hermione shook her head. She had taken notes on

everything but what ever happened since Neville left during lunch break…well maybe not every day at

least. Just then, Professor McGonagall broke from the rest section and led everyone towards his

office, rather than keeping pace with him until dinner time.She turned so she could see Dumbledore

himself smiling slightly behind her."So Ginny, why don't we join you there after breakfast tomorrow

morning," McGoneal suggested."Well yes, well probably because it will be your first meeting here

before class starts again next Friday afternoon.""So Luna and Haruhi-san were worried about me

leaving yesterday too?" Draco objected."Yeah. They overheard my mum talking over the phone

explaining how nervous she felt getting away earlier by herself – which means either Malfoy isn’t

very happy or something. He mentioned Remus' case and the fact that he'd tried to buy him some

things, but didn't get any of them! They were all made by his old folks…who was probably a lot older

than himself if not more so – which is why it took Sirius almost two weeks before they got anything

from either one place. The twins had been staying with him since their first year in school, and

found him wandering around town enjoying himself…he hadn’t even finished reading at night as he

tended Harry's book on how magic worked for the school library when the teachers started making

copies up every day."You know what?" Sirius asked curiously. "It seems that you have quite become an

internet sensation among our people. I'm sure your father will be delighted to hear about this

news."The twins looked rather surprised because both Regulus (the little boy) who wasn- mum called

after Sirius and Hermione"I've been travelling through time looking over books," commented Neville

excitedly while Harry looked down into his eyes wondering whether he should join them.Harry chuckled

nervously as Neville stepped aside and wandered off without comment. Regis stared at Harry blankly

then smiled broadly at him."Now really? What are you doing here, anyway?!" yelled Hermione

incredulously, before turning away again, her face twisted under Ginny “A very small shop selling

potions supplies … please excuse me.""Hello there!" exclaimed Harry cheerfully, walking out onto

sight. It turned out everyone had been watching her move at some point since she'd gotten back from

the circus and were wondering if it was really alright to be so quick with a limp baby like

that."Weirdo," Harry said, "you're still not as good a dancer as I thought you would have after

everything we've done in the meantime.""That's true," Hermione admitted quietly"Just do your best

now then," Neville offered, looking tired too when he looked around the room again for anyone who

might notice him moving slowly on the floor.  Everyone noticed his movements just before he walked

off towards the corner of one side where everybody could see what he was doing, but they all stayed

quiet because he wasn't making any sound whatsoever."I'm sorry about that Neville! You look very

exhausted!" Ginny cried"What?" Tom asked, trying desperately hard NOT breathing.Harry chuckled

weakly and moved closer to her "Hey, mate, how are you feeling? Oh, Merlin...""Morning mate...is

something wrong?" Ginny demanded, her tone becoming increasingly tense over the next few minutes

until Ron started coughing up blood even more heavily than usual while others watched them and tried

calling their partners for help.When Percy got sick and took away the whole family, there was also

Harry being kept in an orphanage by three different families (the Weasley Twins).  The first two

parents died shortly after getting caught between McGonagall building 'The Headmaster' into Hogwarts

History. The students all gasped and puffed out their chest, which caused everyone to squeal in

outrage as they were being told that it was a joke!   "What's funny is how you're so stupid!" Ginny

objected.  Ron scowled at her and glared up at Hermione with his head screwed over in disgust."It's

just because I'm the Potter girl," Remus said happily after eating the last of them both down on one

knee before grabbing Susan off him and dragging Harry back towards Gryffindor Tower. "So Dumbledore

has something going?""I have heard rumors from friends about me being able come visit Professor

McGongall for some reason…though we've been assured she'll be coming by owl whenever possible

instead.""How long does he take? He could find us tomorrow morning…" Snape interjected.Aang looked

around confused but then shrugged resignedly. A lot had changed since Sirius' letter arrived

yesterday--his uncle had taken away three of the professors duelling Hagrid personally; now there

wasn't any who could get together or actually attend classes anymore—but no-one wanted people like

this either...anyone wanting to see what happened next would have better luck than Sirius did if

they didn’t already know everything beforehand.Ron sighed once again when Tom appeared behind him

with a box marked ‘Time for NEWT class delivery'.Tom grinned broadly and pulled himself onto Appa's

lap. "Oh, Suki…you're good for a little." Sokka smiled happily and started to sing along with the

rest of them as they made their way down to the dance floor after dinner.Suki blushed when she saw

Katara smiling at her while Rangi leaned over beside him in his chair and nibbled on his cheek

gently."Thanks so much," he said, before settling back into his seat once more. He then headed off

towards school itself. “We should probably head out too.""Great idea Harry!" A great gust blew

through air around Zuko and Jet—Jet was flying overhead from somewhere nearby just hanging by now

without warning or anything! Surely that wouldn’t have been bad news if all those Fire Nation

soldiers had done something like this?The trio turned away slightly confused but nodded thanks

nonetheless; it seemed things were going well until suddenly there was an explosion near one of its

towers blocking everything else. The whole thing went up instantly and two fireballs struck right

smack dab in the center of where everyone stood upon a balcony overlooking Gaoling Mountain (or

rather, both). It took some time for everybody who wasn't involved except Toph slowly to realize

what happened--they began to run past each other again not knowing which tower exploded directly

behind...and even Tom didn- just barely noticed how far ahead we were actually seeing…"So you did

really do your part?""No sir! You
