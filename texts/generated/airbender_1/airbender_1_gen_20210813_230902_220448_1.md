Harry doesn't even realize when he goes to sit down beside her. "I think I just missed you," she

says, and she leans into his lap gently as if trying not be sadistic for a bit longer."Oh, hi

Alice?""Yeah? How was your birthday?" Harry asks with wide eyes at the girl's face in an attempt

take away from their awkwardness that has already been going on since they started dating."We were

talking about doing homework together while we both watched some movies last night," Hermione

replies softly before shrugging and moving aside to grab her hand.  They're now up again after

dinner and they've decided what is best for each other and how much time off school should have left

them by then so far this year.""What are things like today though besides tea and snacks?" Ron asked

curiously once he'd finished eating."Cumming sounds wonderful," Ginny answered, looking around

nervously at all of us but her eyes were fixed upon me. She opened one eye briefly. The girl looked

rather upset--she really didn’t understand why everyone hated her more than the others did. It must

hurt or something...or it was just a memory she had. But honestly speaking..she seems quite happy

right now despite everything. This world seemed way too different without either having any friends

or being alone anymore…it makes things worse because there are always new people who look out for

those around him no matter what kind of weirdo person happens next!"She just glared at him, while

the other two exchanged a look and nodded. The remaining students were still staring."It's alright

Professor," Iris muttered to herself. "As for your brother. He is my best friend.""What do you

mean?""He was with us during lunch break today when we got hurt...but he told us that it didn't

affect him in any way.""I'm sorry kid. I can tell from his face and voice about everything but what

happened yesterday because of me. And now how could someone so rude even try trying our aid against

them? They don’t know if they have friends or family who are willing enough! You really need some

patience Harry""Iris let go of her hand..." Sokka looked up as she watched Tom curiously over

Aang.The boy blinked slowly, then slumped down onto Appa."You're not going back here tomorrow Mr

Potter. It will be fine anyway since Mommy left before breakfast-and Dad seems rather bothered by

all this too," explained Shyu, pulling out his phone and taking another call after Suki had returned

from dinner."If there's something wrong please send an owl right away either Eren won 'em tonight

until 2 AM OR Aunt Wu came along later on Friday afternoon & brought their children home early

Saturday morning instead of running off like everyone else went through school without getting word

till 3 PM owls arrived calling several times every day... where should people go if they have any

more questions?” “I think we need to call and see how many of you are coming. We don't want to be

stuck here without a place for everyone, especially those from the North Pole," explained Aang as he

made his way through the crowd. Everyone except Sokka (who was rather nervous) went out into the

area while Harry had gone off with Katara. The group headed towards Ba Sing Se—the portkey that came

back in time! Even though it wasn…well…it didn--was still just an old wooden shipwreck on top; there

were no survivors or anything either…but then again it would take someone long enough to get

everything together so all three kids could come along."What's going on?" questioned Nora."Harry is

staying at Anzen Hyriu now since I'm sure she'll make some friends soon anyway…""You know about my

friend Zuko!" snapped Dora."The man has been travelling far away over the last few years trying hard

not only survive but help rebuild temples across the world.""And this guy called himself Uncle Iroh

will probably find him very soon after when Hei-Ran comes knocking around tomorrow morning saying

hello too much 'cause Aunt Petunia said something weird today""Oh really?!" cried Ursa. "Donohue

seems like the perfect match up against Bumi who hates being alone right?! My mom always insisted

Dad was there with us and the whole time he couldn't just sit back, but it’s like I'm a part of the

team. “Mom! You guys can practice together or something…that” Mom suddenly cries out in pain as she

sees her son lying unconscious on the floor crying hysterically for help. She pulls his head to her

chest awkwardly and gives him a comforting squeeze. He gasps and begins coughing up blood all over

the room from exhaustion; Katara takes comfort that she is awake—she really should have gone sooner

since they both seem so tired after their training sessions. Her eyes widen at her friend's distress

and fear. As soon this nightmare has come true, Sokka and Mai are nowhere near anywhere nearby. Zuko

watches them struggle under his breath while trying not think about his brother dead or maimed by a

stray fire ball. They barely even make eye contact when Rangi rolls down onto Appa‘s shoulder and

snatches one arm away warmly before making an unguarded snap to pull Aipom and Ty Lee close enough

so neither of them will fall off themselves if someone notices...and then everyone dies? His hands

reach through his robes and yank two more pairs of arms aside--his face goes rigid and he blinks

once again as flames trail across his skin. Suddenly he flails forward toward Iroh who whips around

wildly laughing as Azula dashes after him. "I'm so sorry," she says, but then sighs in relief and

takes off running with her hair combed up over her head."Don't you think I'll be okay?" Sokka asks,

grinning brightly. "Weird for a girl like me.""Of course!" Zuko chimes happily when Katara joins

them."Now that's the kind of guy who always thinks he can win things by being super awesome or

something," Iris says quietly; all smiles fade away from Ty Lee’s face at this comment to keep

warm."I never thought it would happen again! We're such an old group now...and we still have some

magic left""And maybe Suki will try," Mai reminds her once more before rolling onto her side and

walking towards Appa.She gives Aang a thumbs-up before turning back to his pokeball."So much fun

playing games here though…" She walks past where Iroh is sitting on the bench next Toji has set down

across from each other looking extremely happy.The two girls cheer loudly beside Tsunade while Yue

flings herself out into the air (not because she likes how spicy she smells, they both know), Bumi

goes flying through the sky overhead waving one hand proudly despite her shyness.Katya snorts deeply

as Y/N just flies under Toph“you sound pretty good  yip kid, right? Let me check.  I haven't done a

full moon yet." Harry mused as he wandered past them, picking up the scroll from his pocket. "You're

supposed to keep your owl on hand when you go out for drinks?" Sirius asked curiously, sitting down

next in front of him. He had only just finished getting ready and was surprised that Hermione hadn’t

gone with him--she seemed rather chipper now, even if she certainly didn ‘look like such an

idiot'.Neville nodded sympathetically, turning towards Tom to catch up once more before following

after himself. Aang turned slightly annoyed at how things went by, but then returned quickly enough

not so much because there was any chance of mischief or anger between them.Harry took another sip of

the potion and sighed somewhat nervously. They were still outside early this morning, leaving no

trace of their new friends behind, and they should be fine while they were here. Not all of them had

been able come back since Appa's arrival—it wasn…errr sure, really; it must have taken some time to

get everyone ashore already anyway."A good start," Dumbledore said quietly. “It is quite a feat

considering we are heading into a war zone.""I'd say most of us would agree," Adeline agreed.He saw

Draco smile faintly and look around amused. The two men looked mildly surprised too. When they

arrived at Hogwarts, Harry found Professor Sprout
