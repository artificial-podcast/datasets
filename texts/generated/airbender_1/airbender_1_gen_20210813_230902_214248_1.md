I saw large cracks in the wall where the banging was coming from, but they were just a few feet

away. I stood up and walked over to them."You think you can do this?" Hermione asked"Yeah.""How did

you know about these things? The goblins have all of us together with them at their headquarters

when we went there," Ludo answered. "So why didn't anyone tell me that it was for our own good or

something so that everyone could understand what happened afterwards rather than relying on one

person to make decisions alone as if he’d always been blind himself?" she asked.Harry nodded, "As

long Lamara doesn ‘know' much more about magic than most people here, whatever her reasons are may

be. She told him everything until now though--he has no idea how other wizards work around their

limitations like theirs does since Harry had already read his scrolls while learning magical theory

lessons recently.""What sort…magic?" Luna demanded.Lamara blinked, then raised an eyebrow.Hermione

looked confused, before shrugged, sounding somewhat relieved even by the fact that she hadnt

forgotten anything else. Harry smiled awkwardly before turning back to look behind herself again

after glancing through the cracked walls."That's great! It really is!" Harry exclaimed.The two girls

laughed quietly out loud as well; both laughing along too enthusiastically without any apparent

discomfort. They each took turns making eye contact whilst looking relaxed about themselves – not

exactly creepy or scary, actually - and getting in that way was just a little too much. "So I'll be

heading down to the forest next," he said with a grin as Harry stepped out of the trees and then

back inside."Where?" asked Draco curiously.Harry nodded.  He didn't see any other visitors coming up

from there at all. "I don’t know what you mean," said Draco firmly once they were safely outside of

Hogwarts itself again; Harry smiled widely and walked towards them."You've got another big tree on

your side? That one's about two feet tall!" Neville called after him excitedly before looking over

his shoulder for an answer which he promptly did when they arrived.~oOo~They found themselves upon

their own steps into whatever great wilderness had sprung up around Hogwarts – where they could go

get lost while away travelling through it, explore its flora rather than just being trapped by magic

or having bad luck trying (or even failing) tricks without help first. Once everyone settled himself

behind a bench beside some bushes, Dumbledore led Harry downstairs under such care that he wouldn'

forget anything happening during meditation sessions beforehand. It took more practice this time

since he'd spent so many hours meditating though: every single morning until lunchtime, dinner till

late afternoon…every day between classes, homework passed faster and quicker now because Hagrid hadn

'got everything organized'. Harry still managed pretty much straight-up access to all areas

surrounding school via both the Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom’s air temples. As an added bonus, it

allows students who are already in a class or internship program with other Air Nomads in order for

them from receiving any extra classes/committations they might have earned while out of Hogwarts—not

that this is necessary!  The whole point was that when you were new at Hogwarts it became easy

enough just to keep up on stuff until school started getting busy so instead we decided making sure

everyone had proper summer internships within our walls…but then there's also the fact your parents

took over as teachers after graduating." "That explains why my dad kept teaching me how not only

could I do magic without fear but even if it wasn't he still made spells himself through years spent

practicing his art since before Christmas…" Luna noted curiously. Sirius chuckled.  “I like doing

things myself too. It makes learning about what works easier because now I can actually practice

something else quickly than being stuck having to work long hours every day searching for one thing

outside your theoretical range anymore. There'll be less time wasted by forgetting which parts

worked well together versus trying different combinations depending upon whether it really matters

later. If anything more useful will come along during their sixth year term--you'd think she would

notice!" Harry agreed dryly once breakfast finished. They left rather early into morning; Hermione

hadn't gotten around to finishing her homework yet – most likely due simply (but I'm sure that's the

only reason he didn't want to see me again), because it was so embarrassing."You're going over some

of my ideas, Katara," Iris said. "I can do it myself if you like, but why not go with what I have

already?"Katka shrugged and shook her head at Zuko before speaking up."I don’t know how much time

has passed since we met last week, Sokka," she commented flatly after a moment"It wasn…like six

months? We were all here for an hour just talking about stuff.""That doesn-""you aren't really

planning on having us spend any more time together now than when they both started!""You weren

'going', right then?"Zuzu sighed in resignation as his eyes fell on the book beside him; Iroh looked

rather apologetic from the bookshelf. He'd been somewhat surprised by their conversation back home

-- perhaps this place would be helpful enough even if there weren— though certainly nothing too new

or drastic should change things further…"We haven-'twas two weeks away! So long, is it?"The rest

settled into their quiet silence until dinnertime. Harry took one look around once per day during

the trip, wondering whether Harry had actually gone through every single element correctly -

particularly under the circumstances, given the way Sirius seemed oblivious towards everything else.

It made sense considering he'd spent the last week doing homework, but now…“Why don't you write a

letter to  me? I'm so busy with school that I can barely remember what's been happening! Plus some

stupid stuff about  Muggle technology and things not being taught in Hogwarts is bothering us! We're

going home for Christmas--I've already told my parents." Harry mused, even though there was no reply

from them either way—and then his heart started pounding again. ”What are you two talking of?! You

should go back into Hogwarts at once because it looks like we'll be stuck waiting on your doorstep

after all these years together! Is this how you keep people coming here without getting married or

having kids while they wait outside? Because if you guys want anything done by tomorrow afternoon

anyway, well...we have time before curfew until 2 pm.. That's when you need help finding family

somewhere to live; right where Appa comes through first....oh yes-thank goodness-heh-that little

girl who wrote those letters seems very nice. What were they expecting?""They asked her husband

Dudley.""Did she see him lately?" “He doesn' seem too bothered anymore." "No worries. He just missed

Aunt Petunia and Sirius and isnt able come get herself anyplace near as easily. We got our own house

nearby next door!""Yeah, thanks, really, everyone has paid their respects yesterday morning, and the

others had a bit of a laugh as well.  I was sitting here talking to my friends about our upcoming

game against Gryffindor, just before they were due to take part in the competition." "I think we

should get going Harry. It's nice to see you again.""It is pleasant that so many people are still

waiting for me, but there have been some unexpected guests coming into the building this evening,

who will be joining us shortly," she answered.Harry nodded and left with her bag, which he handed

over at his side when Hermione returned it. He glanced around curiously then turned back towards

where Iris stood watching him play with Sirius' broomstick while he waited for them all—the two of

these students seemed quite pleased by how well-behaved both men became afterwards--and soon saw

Draco returning from his trip to Durmstrang after finishing up dinner earlier than expected.

"So…what do your plans look like?""Well…""There won't always seem much to be said on the Hogwarts

Express once every few weeks or so. Some of those folks actually asked if anything could happen

through the owl service; none want any longer because they know what 'happens,' and don’t expect

more announcements during the month ahead."They didn? What did Dumbledore tell them today?" Ron

wondered.Ginny sighed and grabbed one oatmeal cup out between Tom (who'd gotten himself
