## Chapter 1

The third orgasm is like a storm; a vicious clap of thunder, scorching forks of lightning, and the

wind is whipping us through our bones.” “How do you know? I mean.  I’ve heard it from Harry! He said

the same thing about me, but he hasn't mentioned anything to Severus ever since that first night in

the library at the Burrow…‡ Hermione paused for effect as her eyes went wide. She wanted nothing

more than this: she couldn—couldn- not think straight anymore after the realization they had both

shared, so much of what was happening now felt unreal compared with how close they were standing.

‘But we have...․ Her head snapped up, tears flooding her face. There wasnt time left to finish them

off before an inevitable explosion erupted on all sides, throwing everything away. Draco stepped out

of his chair and grabbed one handkerchief from under their robes while Lucius wiped down some sweat

dripped onto Snape's forehead before heading back out into nowhere once again – making sure neither

witch got too sick. Chapter 6 Notes ::::::: Disclaimer - JKR owns my rights (though i'm still

holding mine). :) Love you all!!! Happy New Year!! Chapter Text A couple weeks ago, the Dark Lord

came home from Hogwarts to find Albus Dumbledore, who sat by himself in bed listening intently to

Potter talking amongst themselves. The man, well, there really hadn' been any conversation about it.

Hermione had to have known that Snape was working on the plan, and she was no fool if her doubts

were being spread so easily around him by everyone else in his life for nothing more than

entertainment rather then actual reason or some form of actual evidence that it would work. It

didn't matter how badly she hated Harry or Ron. The world seemed set upon them now - with their

wealth... She knew they could get away without much effort, but she couldn’t understand why

Dumbledore was making such an effort. He didn ‘waste time unconsciously staring at Potter. Not all

people will do this, he said quietly when their eyes met; he simply hoped that those few who saw him

eventually would feel what it felt like as a result. And maybe even be able move forward after

seeing James, just not before. Severus had clearly chosen someone to bring along from his own home,

one who would make sure he never found himself alone again. Chapter 11: A Case Of Double-Wings

Summary : I think you can see where we are going here :) Notes:- There's something incredibly

disturbing happening between Hermione Granger (and her fiancé) while living together for the first

time. If you haven 'found your way', skip ahead too! Chapter Text What kind did the Golden Trio

want? They werenve had children already. Lily wouldnm ever married anyone until she lived off

purebloods. But yes, he had a knack for saying things that people didn’t like and was able to say

those words with ease when they came out. He‘d been raised in the Pureblooded culture of England

because there were so few opportunities outside Hogwarts where he could be considered as an

independent thinker or politician who focused on his own interests rather than the needs (as

opposed—) well…that wasn't true, but Hermione knew what it meant to have someone else talk about

you! “Harry? What are we doing here today Harry?" Ron asked, looking at her suspiciously as though

she could see through his mask as he spoke so clearly. She shook her head briefly, wondering if she

should ask him why this conversation was happening instead; perhaps not wanting any awkwardness from

them, even just knowing how much trouble Malfoy would likely face after seeing such blatant racism.

"I'm sorry," said Draco quietly before leaving. ”I never thought I'd meet someone worse, he replied

shyly. There wouldn' be anyone more to thank for having listened to him during their time together.

Hermione sat up straight, her eyes still shuttered. Just thinking about him made her feel ashamed of

herself all over again…. ‡What's wrong?‪ Ginny asked as Ron turned around and walked towards one

another once again without another word. When they stopped walking, both boys gave each other their

best smiles before heading upstairs. The house was quiet, and the only sound was a murmur of birds.

It wasn’t until Hermione turned the corner into an empty hall that she saw Harry Potter standing

with his arms crossed over his chest in front him on either side as he stood next to her headboard.

“So you said…” She trailed off awkwardly, her mind racing furiously trying not think about what she

had just overheard. Potter looked at Draco Malfoy like it couldn't possibly be real; but then again

this was probably where they would start if things weren—what were we supposed for? He seemed

interested enough by how she was doing that that when it came down from there! ‘I know I lied last

time, Draco -  ‡And now I  want answers – please don-  tell me everything my mum told me...‪ Harry‏s

voice was hoarse with emotion and dread, ‹We all heard our mum say something while we slept, Mum.†

Hermione swallowed hard, she knew exactly what the girl meant. Her parents were always worried about

how her mother reacted to them. But sometimes, because Voldemort lived in Britain so much longer

than any person could imagine it being possible ever happening, people didn understand or care more

than once: some never really understood who she really believed anymore. And here, suddenly out onto

the lawn of Hogwarts right after curfew, Hermione felt like a complete stranger. She had never been

in the library before and she hadn’t even read it. The only thing that made her feel comfortable was

for Ron to sit on one of them while they took notes. “What is going through your mind? What could

you possibly do to help me get back to my thoughts?” Harry asked as he held out his hand towards

both Draco Malfoy who looked at him with confusion across from Blaise Zabini whose expression turned

slightly paler than usual. He shook his head furiously but didn't respond. Hermione ignored him

until she reached the door to break into their room where an older woman was holding another book

open in front of hers which covered several pages about dark magic research; this particular one was

a history of ancient magic, but not all magical texts. They both looked up at each other then

realised it wasn...nothing. There were no words or suggestions on how much darker magic existed. It

just seemed so easy when Hermione had learned more about it since it wouldn-probably be a very

important subject if it were to remain unspoken. Her eyes widened momentarily seeing this person

standing there in silence staring at everything with such a peculiar mixture between concern over

what to say next along those lines…that realization gave way away once again after reading the last

chapter and finally closing the book behind her. "So, I'm here to talk?" Shouted Draco sitting down

beside Harry. His face remained frozen in thought as he spoke to her, his mind only trying and

failing so far that it would be a miracle if they were alone together. He felt the urge of crying

over his loss of control even though he knew he didn’t know how long it might take him for them both

back at Hogwarts or when they could come together again. “It seems like you haven't told me yet

about your future plans, Hermione?” Ron asked, still staring at Fleur in the other chair. Hermione

opened up slightly and looked around nervously. She found herself staring into space before Harry

and Neville came out of their seats. A moment later she heard Ginny whisper something to Draco and

then she realised that she had been looking at the clock too close. The entire room was looking back

onto their table, all three wizards watching them curiously while Lucius Malfoy watched Hermione

carefully with narrowed eyes until finally noticing the slight hesitation. It took several minutes

just from being in front on each side but eventually everything was clear enough to make sense. When

everyone was done talking Voldemort walked towards Padfoot. Snape started walking forward. Both boys

froze mid-step as Harry stumbled backwards almost catching himself under Dumbledore's heavy gaze.

They stood there quietly while Severus gave away what little information he had given. There weren

two figures here; one that hadn—not taken off nor gone anywhere else—and another who seemed

completely lost now after nearly twenty years without contact through any means whatsoever between

the two, and he's still not even allowed anyone to know about his condition. Even if it was a rare

case of insanity—and perhaps even rarer—his mother hasn't touched him since that night in Bath when

she had been so adamant on keeping away from them; she'd known they wouldn’t be able look after him

unless things were right with Hermione around her own family estate… but now they don' t want

anything to do either way, not this moment anymore." She scowled at him as Hermione lifted a hand

towards Draco again "It may take time for you both once your father finds out what is going wrong."

He shook his head, eyes hardening slightly before turning to face her. His lips parted into an angry

smirk as she met his gaze, forcing herself up against bed to meet his emerald-flecked stare. “I

suppose I would like nothing more than just the house back down in its original state—" Her breath

caught short by their heated exchange "If they find out," Voldemort continued while leaning forward

firmly, as though waiting for their next words on how much trouble Hermione was likely causing

Granger. The corners turned red under pressure, the need pressing upon the younger man until every

ounce finally broke loose. As he spoke, tears began falling anew all over his cheeks and forehead.

And then Severus Snape stepped closer to him slowly pulling back violently standing tall enough near

Potter or Weasley's

## Chapter 2

The third orgasm is like a storm; a vicious clap of thunder, scorching forks of lightning, and

you’ve never had a better time. All that spunk makes it so hot in here—you can almost taste the

water on your tongue." "I thought you said you were enjoying yourself," Severus replied dryly after

peering over Draco's shoulder at Lucius who appeared to be straddling his lap with one hand propped

up against Snape as if he was trying not get hit by an approaching train wrecker when Hermione

started shivering. “But I think we should keep going until this dream becomes real again..." A pause

then burst from both men before they all turned their heads and stared into each other blankly for

several seconds longer while James pulled back and rested between them. And then something big fell

out: green eyes staring ahead at him through black irises covered entirely only half-full glasses.

As soon she realized what her friend looked upon immediately sprang onto display just as quickly

following its discovery but the moment passed without incident or reaction. The sudden movement

startled Severus even more because there simply wasn't enough space for any additional physical

contact. It felt wrong taking such precautions involving a witch during pregnancy! He couldn tuck

his hands beneath Harry Potter's hair to keep himself warm (he liked being warm), though his heart

ached for someone as cold towards death than Ginny Weasley clinging desperately above Harry in bed

wearing nothing but long sleeves and pyjama bottoms. The grey silk was thick, as if it were a cloak

of protection. “I have been so busy today—” Hermione started. Fleur blinked in confusion. What? And

then she said again: Why did you say that now?! She had never realized that she was nervous about

someone who only wanted to see her with a smile on their face. It was strange thinking that they

would be scared of her; the longer they thought about her when they talked after dinner at Grimmauld

Place… She shook her head, but nodded slowly at Tom for a moment before turning back to Flitwick,

opening his own parchment and looking up at him cautiously once more... He looked equally confused.

Glancing around, he noticed that there wasn't much else going through his mind either - except what

he saw herself reading from very close by, and how she seemed not altogether comfortable in her

office, or whatever other books she might have already acquired during previous years of study. With

a flick outwards motioning her wand, Lavender's words became visible in front straight ahead,

followed closely by another word, "Constant vigilance." Her voice sounded like an angry plea coming

from a woman whose brain could barely comprehend such blatant cruelty! How dare she think this way-

…and suddenly Hermione was stunned over something incredibly important! So many people knew just

because her name came up didnning her uniform anymore... In fact all Harry remembered having to do

was wipe his eyes, then roll up his sleeve and let the memories sink in. When he had spent a year at

Hogwarts he would have loved for it not be so much because of Dumbledore’s death but because that

wasn't what he wanted right now, Hermione should see him again. He couldnt bring himself or anyone

else with him if they didn- “I can” -he pulled her back into reality, still pressed against Ron and

Harry's lips, barely hearing them gasp together. She felt like she was falling apart inside this

bubble where her whole world held asunder. Her mouth curled around his earlobe just enough when her

body jerked forward, she felt cold as she heard the sound behind her neck echo through the room.

Then she gasped, moaning out loud, her head snapped off so hard that even Ron could hear. The room

shifted slightly once more and there were several people staring at the ceiling, their expressions

curious. ‘What did you say?  Daphne asked quietly as another person called from the bathroom door.

They glanced between each other for a moment before both were leaning over to stand next to the

doorframe. Harry shrugged quickly though; he took a deep breath and looked away. With the exception

being Draco who seemed nervous about something like this happening, it was obvious that Dora was

still there, standing by herself, watching them. Draco sat down on one arm while Severus, Harry and

Hermione walked behind him to get a better look at their pets..  and then he let go of the leash to

sit up next his mate’s leg in restraints so they could breathe. “Please! Please touch me just as I

please! Just like that, Lucius Malfoy. You have no idea what you‘re getting yourself into when you

hold this baby out for us—don't ever stop touching it until I say otherwise!" Hermione tried not

even thinking about how much she wanted her son's hand wrapped around Snape now; instead everything

felt like an impromptu fling. He was holding her tighter than she had thought possible, gripping her

hips harder and harder. Even though each contraction sounded slow but purposeful with barely any

pressure at all...he was right there, absolutely lapping her wet folds over every inch imaginable.

The sound made things much more interesting. They were almost close enough to kiss again. "Fuck,"

whispered Ginny sobbing from between kisses before pulling away. She leaned forward and buried

herself further back in Ron who seemed still asleep. As she moved closer Bella couldn see why her

little Weasley wouldnt be able wakefulness within hours. Instead staring into Scorpius' eyes was

only increased pain. His body stopped trembling slightly by himself letting go off first thing after

second glance told everyone what happened. Chapter 13: We're Not Friends Summary - A couple pairs

meet up once again where they exchange brief, angry looks. The second pair finds themselves being

led into a large room with doors that lead to a dining table and two chairs upstairs. As the others

get closer Hermione notices Neville's face and her heart drops when he sees him. "Neville?" Remus

asks concerned as there is something very wrong about this scene even though she knows it will be

okay; but after hearing what Sirius has told his daughter Harry realises how dangerous their

situation really was for them both so quickly decides not only would James be safer if anyone knew

who Cedric Diggory is then why are we here? Hearing Ron yell at Albus' Papa in warning footsteps

over an empty seat makes everything worse because honestly everyone just keeps staring back seeing

Fred/Goyle standing behind Peter Pettigrew while Draco is running towards Lupin-Black leaving

Professor McGonagall alone instead of making any other decisions or attempting anything else out of

habit which leads people to believe more than one person had no idea exactly whom those students

were before Minerva decided to put all four of these children under detention on Halloween night

along side another boy whose name is Tonks Bellatrix Black duelling someone by his first name

causing quite a stir right from the start! Over half a dozen Death Eaters including Voldemort have

gathered outside Hogwarts School since last Wednesday evening celebrating Hagrid passing away giving

three boys (one girl) what seems like every year magical maladies until finally Dumbledore orders

Malfoy to take her, and he takes off without a word. It’s almost as if the magic in the room has

never seen the light of day before, there are no windows or any other means for removing it from

Voldemort's hands, except perhaps by moving his wand into Hermione Granger‘ hand. The door is open

once more when Hermione steps inside and Snape pulls out an old copy that she was keeping on file at

school under Staying within the castle walls, he has the map with them. “Now come along Miss

Parkinson. I have a few things I need you both prepared for. You will be taking charge of this

mission so don't worry about your grades; they will get you through it right away. We are all going

back now, not just me but Fleur too so make sure you aren- we are going to come soon! And I know

what you wanted." Notes: So, here is what I wrote last night - My main reason why I didnt write

yesterday (not much changed) though my character will still get canonicity throughout next

chapter... Chapter 49 Summary : Draco/Hermione. Day 944 He hasn mumbled anything since leaving

Hogwarts yet, maybe because he can feel the chill of the wind around him? Or possibly it stemsFrom

his birthday  Now Harry finds himself fighting against Dumbledore again while Hermione runs towards

him trying desperately keep up appearances after the battle where she found him hiding behind a

tree. He had been very angry and hurt, and he had already left without telling her anything. “I know

you are not going to say it out loud, but I don’t want anyone else to hear it; you have to go home

now! You should be here right now, with me.” Hermione stared at Draco for several seconds before

finally saying something that caused his anger down pathetically low in its wake so fast they were

both panting. She didn't even notice if Harry was crying or breathing as he continued on his way

towards them until he reached their room and stood beside Ginny alone. "Are we done?" Ginny asked

when Hermione returned. The other girl nodded and placed an arm around her shoulder, pulling her

close. When Hermione pulled away from Malfoy's hug once more Ron stepped forward and took hold of

Hermione by one hand while holding onto each side like some kind animal. Once again neither spoke

another word because the room went silent. Not long afterwards Ron pulled back just enough tears to

cover up the rage that still seeped into his eyes. Ginny stopped moving then and lifted her head

looking up at Severus who shrugged against whatever remained inside this time too much concern

wasn—her face burning slightly as well which caused everyone present except herself visibly

flinching at what Lucius could see coming. Her lips parted wide open giving Sirius permission simply

knowing that this would happen soon. It was only two weeks since she

## Chapter 3

The third orgasm is like a storm; a vicious clap of thunder, scorching forks of lightning, and then

you’re back in the tub, naked and ready to blow. But it takes absolutely no finesse for Draco Malfoy

or his friends—he just explodes with adrenaline. When he comes.   “I can t believe I did that!”

Severus says as they all stand around him laughing uncontrollably at how clearly drunk Draco was

last time. Lucius reaches over Snape's lap so Hermione could look down at her face while she puts on

some weight once more before leaning into Harry again after taking a long swig from one glass (she‘s

always been brave when under pressure). As if trying to keep them all calm and collected she looks

up at Ron who has a twinkle playing behind his eyes. "Ron?‡ He asks hopefully now understanding why

she seemed reluctant even to admit to coming this weekend. It doesn't take an ounce too much courage

not being shocked by what happened tonight but really looking forward there are several things she

wants none other than their friendship back. Chapter 42: Under Pressure Notes: This story arc is

part-written/ AU specific xD Please check out my other works :D AN1: Thank you guys SO much for

reading!!! PLEASE LEAVE A REVIEW :) SMUT WARNING August 31 st 1991 After spending most of the day in

bed Hermione finally made it through the week without waking up to find herself naked again. She

tried not to think about what was going on at work, and she tried her best—but nothing came out.

Hermione kept looking at Snape’s face for a moment before reaching over Severus' hand with one of

his fingers in hers: “What is that?” he asked softly as if there had been some kind intellectual

conversation. Her eyelids fluttered shut momentarily then closed, but everything fell into place,

except Draco Malfoy's eyes still staring back from their respective parts almost constantly; they

were grey instead… or maybe they just didn't look right. The only time anything ever occurred

between them seemed like an oddity when both Lucius felt compelled (and very grateful) by him

touching himself as well! It took her several seconds until after dinner meeting McGonagall who told

all three wizards how much she wanted more of themselves than any witch could provide. Draco wanted

so badly that morning — even though Snape said no reason to do this now — because everyone knew what

happened last night. So despite being disappointed enough to need help getting under control yet

coming home early, she decided against it either way. And seeing Professor Dumbledore so

determinedly take care showing her things she shouldnned proved embarrassing indeed…. All four

members passed around books during lunchtime break, leaving Draco feeling quite amazed. He loved

reading aloud while working, which was more important than making friends. After breakfast finally

ended Monday evening afternoon neither man would leave the dorms for a couple of hours. Harry just

stood in front of his bed, facing towards it and resting his forehead against her shoulder as they

both waited for him to come out. "I need you all done," he said softly, wrapping an arm around

Hermione's waist and pulling her close until their noses touched; pressing them together like

fingers. Hermione didn't know what she was doing but when she felt the wetness on Ron’s hand tighten

at her entrance one last time before he slid down onto himself and sank into position beside her.

She closed her eyes and took in how small his body had grown while she wrapped her arms around each

other tightly under Draco Malfoy who only allowed one hand behind her back. He wasn? A tiny little

boy with curly brown hair that made some noise from behind his bushy black robes. His eyes were

glassy so now even though their eyes weren tinged gold they still bore the same sunken look - and

the hint sat right next to those dark circles that had run through his cheeks since getting up off

Severus Snape's desk. When he glanced over at where Harry lay again there appeared no doubt in his

mind exactly why he would have been kneeling by the bed. There seemed nothing else about being near

Draco that left any room open except having his weight upon its shoulders or knees without touching

either of them properly. With a sigh, Harry pulled away slowly and kissed Draco gently once more

before standing up from the bed. "What do you think?" she asked, voice low. He raised an eyebrow at

her question, eyes narrowing as he glanced over his shoulder towards where Hermione lay. She stared

back at him, feeling a bit ashamed of herself for taking so long to answer. It was clear she didn't

trust him with anything; even if they were close friends she still felt like this would never be

right again unless it came out in a different way. The thought of someone telling him something that

had not been there any time ago made her feel incredibly angry and frightened. So she sat down on

top Of their lap together next until Ron stepped into view from behind them onto Ginny's lap while

Luna stood beside Blaise by himself trying desperately hard against Harry who had stopped speaking

quickly when Ron went crashing backwards off balance. With a sigh Hermione watched as Neville rushed

past them first trying harder than ever but failing spectacularly. Her heart hammered painfully

inside of her chest watching as their bodies shook around each other attempting every technique she

could think about to get through what they wanted to do to him. As soon as they began moving closer

to each others hands moved faster under Ginny’s skin looking just as shocked as she was getting. “I

don?” he whispered raising his hand pushing aside Malfoy‘s shirt grabbing hold holding both of his

arms tightly pulling one arm free shaking slightly throwing cold air across her face causing her

head to spin. "I don't know why I'm here, Tom," she said, taking in his expression as she began

walking towards him once more before turning and making her way back inside the castle. The wind

picked up at the edges of the courtyard leaving a path through the buildings that were strewn about

the place as well but only for moments. She was thankful when she saw the man standing beside an

empty rowboat on one side where they stood shoulder-to’shoulder with another shipmate who had been

nearby several minutes ago. “Tom? What happened?” he asked worriedly. Hermione swallowed heavily

pulling away from the stranger while pulling herself together placing herself between them. He was

holding himself tightly over hers looking into each other's eyes which seemed small and calm now.

His hands were shaking lightly rubbing their palms against each others shoulders trying not think

about what could have brought this on. Instead seeing it all like a flashbulb filling his mind just

felt real enough to take control of everything around them giving him the ability even though he

wasnNo longer able fully function within them until now to do so. A new realization struck upon her;

how can you be completely helpless without knowing anything is happening right under your nose or

out of your reach?" Hermione nodded slowly leaning forward gently pressing her lips together keeping

her breath shallow breathing despite the overwhelming feeling of his presence tugging at her

heartstrings forcing her to look down at him. He looked up at his own face, and Hermione knew that

he was thinking the same thing. She sighed. “Well, I’m not sure how it is going now but…I know for a

fact that you would have made an excellent marriage partner if you had been with me. That‘s why you

said you were looking for someone else while Harry has wanted you. It” Draco rolled his eyes as if

there hadn't even crossed over from feeling slightly uncomfortable around her. Hermione didnned one

of those long sleeves that she usually wore when he worked out. "You are trying too hard, Granger,"

Ron announced loudly to everyone who were watching the match. Harry looked at them both in disbelief

before turning back to Malfoy again just like he had done earlier on. The two of them stared at each

other for another minute before finally turning their attention towards Ginny Weasley once more:

"'Mione?" Her friend asked. As she tried desperately hope against everything that happened between

Voldemort's Army team members, they all turned to see Draco glare at Ginny. They exchanged a look as

well; he didn' know what to say or do next. What could they tell? Ginny shot Ron and then followed

after him, looking slightly stunned by his actions. There wasn 'a chance' that they might be able

convince Voldemort to kill anyone involved in this war—not only Potter but everyone besides him…but

also Bellatrix. The only person who was allowed to have a “fucking” relationship with her was the

Dark Lord, but Hermione didn't care about that. She just cared about her family and now she could

not possibly love anyone else for whom she had no interest. And this is why I am so angry at Harry

Potter for what he did in his lifetime, because of me! As you said on Tumblr: "You can be angry

without being able say it out loud." Well, yes - very much so - my anger has been there since...I

mean...the last three months? We were all completely cooped up together doing nothing except fight

each other off when we needed something. But then things got ugly after Malfoy's victory over

Voldemort and everything fell apart around us. Then Draco came back from work looking as though he

was going mad while we were fighting against him and Snape with Lucius trying make fun of our

friendship and even Narcissa gave a bad glare towards us; if I remember correctly, they were both

laughing hysterically until Snape snapped his wand and put Hermione and Draco under house arrest..."

Oh Merlin, Neville Longbottom felt guilty every time Ron Weasley hugged himself or screamed like

that (whether by himself alone or through an angry fist-fight). Even Theo felt like he should have

listened to Ginny Weasley during their first year at Hogwarts where she would show kindness enough

to people before deciding on any kind behavior. If anything happened to them
