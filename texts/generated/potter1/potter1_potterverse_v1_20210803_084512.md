'“Use me…” she breathed, and immediately felt another thrust against her hips'

## Chapter 1

“Use me…” she breathed, and immediately felt another thrust against her hips. She had not been

expecting this particular feeling. Her legs were on fire now that they began to move in tandem with

each other as the pleasure pulsed through them together - from their bodies it was like a scream of

ecstasy at being connected by magic between two of those fluids again- but seeing Hermione Granger

take such care over Tom Riddle... It was almost too much for her even though he clearly wasn't about

losing his virginity right then. ‘What?’ Hermione asked, trying desperately hard only just hearing

him call out what he had done. He suddenly looked up into hers, smiling widely before turning back

around to face her. His eyes moved down her body, letting go behind her knees and towards Harry who

stopped moving when she saw how aroused Draco already appeared. The other boy's mouth moved lower

than usual so slowly that it caught on quickly as his fingers trailed along Ron Weasley manhood. Ron

gasped loudly while his hands moved more firmly inside himself; one hand reaching underneath the

waistband of the shirtless wizard to grip his hair as he gave into his urges. When he got past Draco

Malfoy there would be no way anyone else could get close enough to touch either of them without

hurting both their minds or themselves. As soon Voldemort pulled away from his lover, Ron stood

still looking at Harry Potter with intense lust in his eyes. They had known until very recently that

he would never have given up on the love of his life for anyone. He had to admit, it was a little

unnerving. But not without a fight or any kind death in store for him if it meant leaving Hogwarts

and getting back into Grimmauld Place with everyone else. When he stepped out onto Floo 12th

September 2013 Harry was still working hard at sorting through the papers so much as possible but

this time he decided they were all too important now. "I know you are going over your notes," Draco

said, as the door opened behind him suddenly carrying a stack from a drawer down which contained a

book. The page was beautiful, filled full colour with gold leafs in some places while others felt

like diamonds or pearls in other areas where there wasn't anything special about them either; a

couple almost made sense though. Harry couldn’t help smiling when another person approached him from

behind looking slightly embarrassed by what he was reading. “This is Potter?” Hermione asked,

standing next one arm across from him trying her best look. It was Ron who pulled open the book,

giving both boys a curious glance before taking it off the shelf. There seemed no other book around

here than those containing blood wards and curses. Draco smirked knowingly at the look she gave him.

She didnned an expression of shock and even if Voldemort hadn's wand at hand he could feel Hermione

sighing against herself again, "Have you heard?" The words were whispered in his ear like a whisper,

and he looked at her with wide eyes. He wanted to know how she felt about him now that he knew what

was coming. She was looking forward just the same as he had before they had taken the first steps

towards them; her heart racing from within and her body throbbing painfully beneath it all for a

moment. His voice echoed around them and Hermione could feel the tears pooling on their faces as her

mind raced frantically trying not think of what had happened when they broke apart into so many

pieces. "I told you I loved you," Lucius said softly, leaning back against one shoulder as if

hearing him. As though it meant something good to him as well - or more. For once there wasn't a

single shred left of hope between the two boys, because it was then that Draco felt the gentle hand

on top form hers begin its slow ascent up her spine until finally, after almost an hour's worth

spent out cold over dinner? Draco smiled, feeling the soft warmth rise down onto his neck and brush

across his chest, but he didn’t bother crying through clenched teeth right away. Instead rested the

length upon himself once more, tugging hard enough to give him time since she had reached climax.

And this time was different. Like his own day. It began instead only by whispering: “Mmm, yes...”

Chapter 3 Notes:- I apologize! So much has happened and there is a lot of anger. Also, my biggest

mistake was writing the whole story; that’s probably why it took me so long to finish this chapter

(but hey, at least you are helping with this). It‘ll be okay if everyone starts posting by next week

or two :) Alpha and beta love to Kyonomiko on discord as always for her lovely kudo reviews!! Enjoy

read/streamed!!! Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter nor Ron Weasley but thank you very MUCH

Roilenaar ❤︎ Chapter Text After spending half an hour alone in Hermione Granger's bed after

breakfast, she woke up early again. She felt exhausted just sitting out in front Malfoy Manor

looking like someone had slapped her. Well no one did, but she couldn “t decide” what to do either;

not wanting Draco finding out how angry he really looked, even though he was his father , so if

anyone found out right now they‡d know exactly whom to call. Hermione had gone over every note she‷d

received from him regarding Lucius when Draco had finally gotten them back together before the

holidays ended. The letter had been extremely sweet and heartfelt, telling everything she needed

from herself and her future husband in order go forward. It also made absolutely no sense that the

entire Order was using the Mark, and so he hoped it didn’t lead to more deaths than necessary. He

had given her his word on the matter, but she needed him to know what would happen if she did not

heed their pleas. Chapter 13: The Curse of Magic Summary for this chapter Notes: I have a new

Chapter Text Draco stepped through another door into Diagon Alley when he found Ron standing outside

an enormous storeroom in Kings Cross, London “Draco?” Harry called out over Daphne who nodded back

with a wave ‘Ron…I am going to tell Hermione about something we are planning today where I will be

showing my family how your husband has died by making the mistake  just yesterday. Is that okay?

Please let me introduce myself properly or can I take up an interview without being rude? I need

answers from both sides before she sees our proposal coming along. Can‡—Harry Weasley (Hermione) As

soon after arriving home late last night Draco sat down on one side behind Blaise Zabini while Theo

watched the proceedings unfold from across empty street. When they finally entered Potter Manor,

Harry s eyes were roaming around with interest, which wasn't surprising considering the man had been

the most vocal critic of Lucius Malfoy at that time, and there was a good chance he’d have heard it.

But then again.     his son seemed to be so inured about their pasts as not wanting any part or

means necessary for him—even if they all knew how much he cared. The thing is: he didn't really care

anymore; in fact, despite having no idea what went on between them during those past several months

(and even after seeing Hermione's feelings when she returned), Draco still felt guilty and

embarrassed by every detail surrounding her relationship with Severus Snape over six years ago — but

just because something seemed different now didnt mean it couldn' taint them ever more forever once

things settled down into normalcy… which was why that very same expression stuck across his face

from where Harry stood watching him. He  couldn “love” anything right now. After everything he'd

said thus far regarding Potter being unfit enough like an adult child? Of course one could say this

back up loud; yes! They were both adults, after all! And yet, clearly he loved each other

differently than he did before…. It was easy sometimes knowing who the father truly wanted. Or who

claimed ownership of another person‘s life somehow instead – perhaps you would know better since

neither Neville nor Ron Weasley had seen fit until recently, however small that may actually seem

today. All he had planned for the day ahead looked exactly perfect with regards to both Harry and

Ron. After about half an hour of waiting, they finally came out of their hiding spot when Sirius

asked them if it was possible. "Yeah, we've got that," he said with a shrug. They were still in a

dark cave under a large oak tree; what made Hermione's breath hitch more than she might have

thought. The stone walls were closed as well and no one could move from within. It was obvious to

anyone who had seen it how much it worried her. She knew there must be something else going on

behind it, but at the moment, she couldn't think straight without thinking. When she left her tent,

Ron pulled up beside her, holding her close while Draco kissed the side where his lips met hers once

more before dropping down onto top just enough so her head rested against him again until his hands

reached up and caressed the backside beneath her curls gently rubbing her tired forehead into smooth

skin as he lifted her hand over yours. He removed her knickers quickly moving slowly pulling them

off trying not breaking eye contact kissing her softly then pushing away sliding inside of her

roughly pressing his mouth hard through hers making sure all the way across his tongue sucking on

the flesh. With each thrust, the air between her legs grew thickened causing her nipples grow harder

looking closer to climaxing around his eyes. Finally coming full circle leaning forward taking hold

placing his face directly upon her waist letting her pull free slipping even

## Chapter 2

“Use me…” she breathed, and immediately felt another thrust against her hips. She was having trouble

imagining it happening now that he had reached out to touch the back of hers; something like a hand

cupping both cheeks. ‘I think you should give him more than this!’ Hermione was panting from what

Ron might be doing, while Harry groaned as she was pulled backwards onto his back with an audible

jerk. He dropped down on top again after several minutes before he found himself completely in

control within her and began stroking her arse slightly. Hermione let out a small moan at the

sensation being given to them in front of everyone - especially Draco who, without a doubt guessed

that Hermione wasn't exactly taking good care of herself when they were so close together. As time

went by between each other's orgasms became more frequent until just recently, even though they

weren actually enjoying themselves. When Harry came over shortly after last night their relationship

ended with Malfoy. The mere idea made Hermione feel sick. If anyone knew what happened between

Hermione Granger during those two weeks was any indication but for herself or Harry then, it would

make a lot less sense to stay friends with him anymore, knowing he was likely to fuck her soon

enough if he wanted to continue living life under one roof. It reminded Hermione a little bit how

much she had struggled to break free months ago towards the end where they could finally share a bed

together, only with Neville. Then he remembered everything about her and his mother, what happened

at the Battle of Hogwarts." "It's not a question," Remus admits as Sirius looks out over the

gardens. "I know it is, but we just don't have an answer right now-" He cuts him off when Hermione

walks into the room. The look on both their faces is one that causes them to exchange worried

glances. "…Papa…" She says before running upstairs while Harry, Ron being in shock after hearing

this, grabs hold onto Sirius' arm. As they break apart there are tears rolling down James’s face

from where she has placed her hand upon his chest; all together causing even more panic to wash

across Molly's body than ever since Minerva had found Tonks alive last night. It feels like hours

pass by without anyone seeing or talking because neither person seems to notice how quickly things

get too quiet for either of them. After ten minutes no one responds and then once everyone else can

see nothing changes except darkening clouds passing through the house Percy starts to cry again. So

much so that Fred and George start crying themselves to sleep under covers beside each other rather

than resting underneath blankets instead doing anything until finally Lee wakes up feeling alone

outside near his father‘s bed. “What am I? What do you mean? Are you okay? Have you been dreaming?"

His friend asks concernedly looking between himself sadly. Hearing Poppy ask such questions Albus

gives another nod and then he starts to lead the way towards the castle, Hermione feeling a little

annoyed that she is doing this without knowing it. Once they are in the library one of the teachers

who was just arriving said "Albus" before heading up to the common room where everyone else has been

sitting for some time already. As soon as Professor Dumbledore leaves Remus walks over and sits down

next him on his chair while Minerva rises from her seat so that Harry can sit across from them both

with something to write at. The only thing missing about all of today's events is how utterly

serious things were between each other during this whole conversation; what exactly happened? What

did Bellatrix mean by 'breaking apart' or why Snape didn't want any part out of their relationship

yet? He doesn’t know if anyone here would have known anything differently than Sirius had when asked

whether Lily had told Voldemort because there were no signs of that exact thing ever occurring again

after everything last night. It could not possibly be possible but even more importantly: does Bella

think James had died?! Chapter 18 Notes: WARNINGS: Sexual content (See the end notes.) Chapter Text

A few hours later Severus is walking into Hogsmeade home early enough for an early breakfast date

which means dinner will start right away too. Walking through the house once every two hours instead

works wonders considering neither of them realize either of these people are actually outside

looking in until around eight o clock. I mean, we have to be up there before that happens." "I guess

so," Hermione said with a nod and Draco sat down next Harry's lap, "Is it not just us?" he asked. He

knew they would all start taking their respective potions tomorrow morning as soon of course

Hermione would go into the kitchen for breakfast today. She didn't want them wondering what was

going on when she got back from her lunch break at home. "It is fine," Harry mused. The four boys

were already eating together now and had been doing much better than usual since then because he

could tell by how well things were getting over his years with Slytherin Quidditch that something

was definitely wrong. They snuck out of bed early one evening after dinner and began making

themselves comfortable inside the tent fire. It was nearing eleven tonight and still very early

enough for Hermione specifically wanting everyone else awake yet again. As far away as he knew this

hadn’t happened earlier but if it did, then maybe someone shouldn ‘be asleep” instead? With a sigh

Harry added: "…it seems like you're finally here, mate." He felt his heart hammering hard against

him even though he couldn no longer believe himself. Ron, Theo...they were such an amazing bunch.

And besides, why wouldn' he do anything differently without them? Even while feeling weak under his

duress, Harry felt great about everything being alright. He'd had the opportunity to talk her out of

it and make her happy—it was worth it for him not wanting this side effect anymore. But now that he

thought about what it could mean... he wasn't sure how much longer he would be able go on with his

life without Riddle and Hermione knowing just how unhappy he really already am; at least until they

gave him something to keep in mind. When Harry returned to Hogwarts, after a few hours spent

reading, studying Quidditch magazines as well before heading off back into Dumbledore’s Army, there

hadn  been any real change in Draco Malfoy after going down to Diagon Alley… but still, no less than

three weeks prior when they found out she's finally going through puberty again…. “Well?” Narcissa

asked, sounding surprised by the news and seeing Harry‘s reaction to it all together since their

initial conversation earlier. ‘What did you do to her? I don  care if we can have sex tomorrow! She

doesn 'ave got us both here today though, so maybe tonight is an opportunity for us then. You look

good enough too.  Narcissia smiled softly at Hermione s smile, ‡I appreciate your enthusiasm Miss

Granger. The rest will come naturally to you. Just think right from day one: our relationship is

more complicated than ever. That is why love matters rather quickly than fear or anger; even in the

face of these very same circumstances, it felt as if all the time she had been in her life was at

risk. It wasn’t just her work with him that worried her. Her life would have to wait and see how he

reacted after such a tumultuous day over dinner—but she knew he needed some time off to think about

what his reaction might be like on Monday night when they returned home from Italy: having spent an

entire evening alone. Draco hadn't expressed any particular concern for Hermione before, so perhaps

Severus had simply encouraged calmness and restlessness instead? Hermione stared up into Snape's

darkened eyes where their kiss rested atop one another beneath black lace curtains.  And then looked

down at Lucius who wore nothing but white robes and bright blue silk stockings. In fact, everything

seemed more sinister than normal by comparison… in case anyone doubted those things. After lunch

came no less disconcerting revelations. “We were discussing something that I donned today, Mr

Malfoy!” Adrian said quietly through clenched teeth, pushing open the door to allow them inside.

Hermione gasped softly as Harry stepped out into view. She didn tuck her hands behind her back

against Theo while Pansy removed Marcus' wand. When Blaise entered without hesitation both wizards

froze and took turns casting spells towards each other without pause nor hesitation whatsoever until

finally getting close enough once again allowing Theo access despite not being able entirely trust

himself to listen, and even when he did manage some good sense in his own time. He was too young to

have the experience of listening to Draco's thoughts without being told by his best friend that

something wasn't right with him as a human being. "We should be doing this together." Hermione says

after nearly four hours thinking about what she has learned so far; it being clear from her last

words that they are going through the motions at this point. Even though Sirius had asked them for

help during their fifth year trying very hard on getting back out into the world while still taking

up space within themselves Harry is grateful none were available here anymore because now more than

ever there is nothing left but pain behind these two boys. Once again Voldemort pauses before

nodding once whereupon he leans forward looking between Potter boy who is clutching his face in

grief and Goyle boy whose arm rests over his head crying uncontrollably towards the end hanging open

due lacklustre panic and the tears running down both cheeks respectively. After having been watching

closely all day Dumbledore takes another sip from his drink sitting beside Snape kneeling across the

table just enough Severus to see everything that has happened since Ron died leaving no doubt how

many things will likely come crashing down upon them soon like those horrible things would do if

used against you or anyone else You needn’t worry yourself Longbottom looks around seeing only small

signs of sadness passing onto everyone present The entire room is filled completely blank except for

## Chapter 3

“Use me…” she breathed, and immediately felt another thrust against her hips. She wasn't sure if it

was more or less than what was in front of them at the moment as they walked down to their room

before Draco stood up from his bedside table, wrapping one arm around Hermione's waist. ‘Don' be shy

Granger; I can get you a nice bath later tonight. We could go out on the grounds...just walk there

for awhile. It would be like watching a movie - no magic involved!’ Ron said softly. They made their

way into Gryffindor Tower where Harry had promised not only him but Sirius too. He knew that he

needed someone with a little bit better control over his emotions when he was going through the

motions of controlling himself by himself. Before anyone else did, he pulled back just enough so

that his cock rested on Remus who kept stroking him while waiting for Harry come. Once all three

boys were close together again, then Harry put his hand over hers again pulling gently until the boy

began moving slowly towards the edge pushing lightly onto him. When he stopped, his eyes looked

between them, their wide askew looking each other down hard at how angry both Severus Snape now

seemed slightly offended by their actions. The Slytherin smirked widely letting out a small whimper

"you know why?" knowing that after having been ordered to do something stupid Lucius had used that

spell many times throughout the war, because he was on a mission to find them. "I'm sorry," she said

softly as she looked over at Harry who had been lying in bed for almost an hour now; trying not to

let his eyes catch anything as they began seeing Hermione's face and he saw Harry's hand raise up

high up across her chest. She felt him grabbing her arm before letting go of it. He stood there for

several seconds looking up at Ron while clutching his shoulder where he had taken Draco's hair back

with one leg as if taking it out of its own accord. They were both staring into each other’s eyes

when neither spoke another word—and then their hands were resting on either side towards hers.

Hermione could hear Malfoy sighing against her ear just slightly but he didn't move away from her

until he reached around pulling her close and pressing himself against what felt like solid stone

and a small piece wrapped tightly around her wrist (Hermione hadn't known about this thing). When

his thumb moved up Hermione whimpered so hard she was certain she couldn tuck her wand in between

herself by moving off of Ron or onto Luna. Her heart wasn-wrenching in fear after hearing such

intimate details; even though he would never admit that it had hurt more than once during all those

years since he'd kissed her… It hurt harder enough to feel sick... "Harry—"she tried again as tears

started shooting down her cheeks soaking through the fabric underneath her black dress. Hermione

moaned as she felt the heat and pressure of Snape's cock begin to race over hers, rolling around her

fingers in a slick path. She could feel herself starting hyperventilating at his presence. He kept

moving back and forth on top while he stroked his cock between them until it reached its peak which

was then abruptly stopped by Lucius' arrival. With her eyes closed Hermione concentrated for a

moment before deciding that she needed more time alone with Severus again after everything they had

been through together this morning; even though their bodies were so far apart she didn't want him

inside or out. "I think I need you to come harder," Draco commanded from somewhere behind her desk

as the other witch grabbed hold fast enough not only did there have no way to get up without being

sucked but there also would be little to no friction once he was fully seated right where she wanted

him. And now she knew why. There was a reason he'd brought her here today despite knowing she wasn’t

ready yet because none made sense, and all of these things must mean something. When Snape began

pushing himself away Hermione couldn...not well. It was almost too much trouble to handle when her

knees were weak and she was forced to sit across one another like nothing existed anymore since no

one was going anywhere near her. Not really sure what to do, either Granger or anything, she sat

next Ron who grunted softly under control. "I don't think I could have done that without you."

"What?" Harry asked, sounding startled and almost a little confused about what he was supposed to

say instead of doing. He had no idea how long it would take him before he got his answer out. When

Ron finally spoke again, they both looked at each other in confusion. The moment everything was

over, Hermione went back to her homework and began writing down the names on parchment. She also

wrote up a few things she'd like for her NEWT essays which she kept updated with each new day.

Finally, after finishing all of those things, Neville came rushing into their room where he stared

blankly at them. At first, he thought they were just going through some kind intellectual test, but

then he remembered that they had gone straight to class early so that no one else could finish

reading until late afternoon. Seeing the two students standing there with Professor Slughorn

watching them with a look upon its face, worried that someone might be getting nervous or even angry

when Hermione was finished and waiting for them outside, his heart sank. There weren’t many people

around now, and as such only ten minutes ago, this would not happen. ‘Mione!” Neville said suddenly

from where she stood looking at him. Hermione didn  know if he understood what she was saying

anymore. His eyes widened slightly because he knew exactly why she felt afraid; anxiety. Her fear

was that if she were to go into battle alone with a dragon, her chances of getting caught were at an

all-time high. She couldn’t believe it, but the thought made Hermione want tears in front and eyes

full on fire… It didn't make her feel any better when she saw Bellatrix Lestrange smiling at them as

she crossed the room, tucking herself back beneath a pile onto top bunk bed beside Harry's body so

tightly wrapped around him there would be no way out. “Theo said you needed me!” The blonde‘s voice

called out from behind him towards his ears while they slept together, making their breathing quick

enough for even the slightest hesitation or question about what it meant. They were already moving

along the floorboards underneath the covers until finally falling apart due both themselves unable

either side up by sheer forcefulness or lack thereof, forcing their hands down over each other ‡

Harry whispered. He had been right next door since before he left Hogwarts—the moment he heard the

word fall off the endearment charm like raindrops spilling across its surface after being tossed

overboard long ago. When he entered Grimmauld Place just seconds later where Snape came running

through the halls wearing only the black robe of Regulus Black with silver chain around one wrist

tied in time with Voldemort himself carved into red runes. There wasn now anything remotely

resembling concern regarding this man, neither of them would be able to protect him. They'd lost two

brothers—and they were all more than capable fighters if he had the opportunity and ability;

otherwise she couldn't help but wonder how much longer it would take for him gone from being a

father figure in London after that tragedy? Had Tom’s life been completely destroyed by his own

father's death-endings now?! She glanced at Harry who stood taller with red hair like an angel as

though searching for her lost brother, his features so angular and full off dark curls framing their

face and chin just like Draco himself did when walking down the aisle of Grimmauld Place. She

didnned nothing but black robes over thick gloves on which sat several bookshelves containing

information about magical creatures living there. “They have no choice!” Hermione said in a low

voice not speaking words aloud, clearly not wanting Ron or Lavender seeing her and Blaise alone. He

turned around slightly still gazing upon them in confusion, but then his gaze became narrowed once

again as his lips curved into something dangerous looking… something wicked. Hermione grabbed Harry

by the arm holding him steady while the other three ran towards where Riddle was standing next door

to one another waiting patiently for the others within these walls left behind before turning back

away. As soon everyone went out to leave, she watched as Padma moved across the room taking in

everyone else surrounding her, shaking hands and smiling kindly without batting eyes. "Thank you for

the lovely dinner." She placed a kiss to his cheek before turning back to Hermione with an open book

in hand while she read it again aloud from one of Ron's books he had left at Grimmauld Place. He

handed over half-full plates before slowly folding them into smaller plates on top as they made

their way out through Flourish & Blotts. It was only then that Harry noticed the strange scent

coming from the kitchen door behind him; fresh sweat from her body, perfume from when they'd been

outside together. The smell filled the room like ice cream in winter and Harry laughed softly after

the moment he realised what it meant – all those thoughts about Voldemort would have ended up here

somewhere else if not for Ginny Malfoy putting up new wards around everyone. But right now though…

After spending so long with him, he knew how much time he wanted this life to end but didn't know

where to start. So far, it seemed he'd found nothing worthwhile. And yet still no answers came; he

wasn’t sure which place he should go next. Luckily Draco followed suit with some tea and food and

went straight to bed, still sitting down beside Pansy who appeared remarkably relaxed despite having

missed curfew since leaving the manor. Harry awoke feeling quite exhausted by the morning; a faint

blush crept to the back face of both Neville Longbottom Jr.'s cheeks as well being able to see Daph
