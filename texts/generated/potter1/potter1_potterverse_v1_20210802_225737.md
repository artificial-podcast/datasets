## Chapter 1

She smirked at those red eyes who were watching her carefully. “We’ll see about that later,

Bellatrix” he said, and she looked up into his dark gaze again before taking a step forward to hug

him tightly. Belladone leaned back in surprise when they felt their breaths getting caught in the

clasping of Harry's arms as they watched her walk away from them with an open expression on hers

like one would expect for the pair only. They walked out the door slowly Hermione could tell by how

tall and well dressed Draco was. He wasn't even looking down but holding hands with his father

directly behind them while walking through it. The only thing stopping them from walking off

together was the fact there had been a tear in both young men's eye just moments before they

separated for air. She stepped closer next towards Malfoy and let go gently so no one else could

hear what she was saying. With everything that happened since then she couldn- not really think

straight anymore; she just kept pushing herself too hard without any real reassurance. It took

several minutes until when everyone turned around and headed downstairs Ron broke apart trying

desperately against all odds to take his wand ready. Before anyone could react he rushed over

towards where Hermione stood beside her and held onto her hand like if something bad had happened.

Taking a deep breath he drew his fingers along each curve between her lips as if tasting it first -

before pulling free and placing his thumb on top suddenly feeling her knuckles go white as she

gasped and dropped to the ground. She was crying out, but it wasn’t anger or pain that caused Draco

so much pleasure—it just had something about him who understood the way a person felt after a loss

of control: vulnerability laced with care..  or spitefulness mixed in for balance; he could feel

those two things together. Hermione‘s voice echoed against Lucius's chest, “Don't let your emotions

cloud you. Don-I don taint you too! You”--he didn`t know what else they could do about this witch if

their emotions were entangled at all...but then again, apparently Narcissa did seem extremely

softhearted when asked how one was handling a situation like hers because Hermione seemed unable

help herself. Draco smiled at himself, surprised by Granger keeping quiet while trying not think

about Snape being there. ‘I love you, Lucius Malfoy - I promise! I love everything you can give me!

And my heart is too big to hold anymore, so thank Merlin we re home now. I need sleep. It doesn'

sound good.‡ A shiver shot through Lucius and sent them both sprawling back into themselves before

returning with renewed energy once more down to earth mode (it took some effort from Blaise). He

heaved out an exasperated sigh, leaning forward to kiss her head, grateful she liked every second

spent holding onto Harry Potter, it had been easier to ignore the things that had happened since

then. But for some reason her stomach didn’t quite want this. “You don't have a choice, Hermione

Granger!” A soft voice shouted from behind them and Ron looked up at Dumbledore with wide eyes as if

expecting him or his son would make a fuss over their situation. His Headmaster stood in front of

both Voldemort's desk on one side while Pansy continued standing next towards McGonagall. Dumbledore

was watching closely when he saw Hermione turn around abruptly. She was wearing very light green

robes; not like most women wore during school, but definitely something different. As soon before

they were alone, Professor Snape came out of the classroom, as did Professor Flitwick who sat across

from Severus directly behind Dumbledore just moments ago - clearly worried about her and wanting

nothing more than comfort for herself. ~~~*~~~~ After spending an hour here alone with Hermione once

again...she heard Pippa ask Neville whether or never Sirius was even home yet. It wasns clear what

exactly everyone else thought until after Remus left class hours later. The silence between them was

so tight there wouldn- be no sense in being quiet anymore either. Despite the fact that neither of

them could speak all night without being separated by a strong head or shoulders, Draco Malfoy felt

sick because he couldn tuck away himself into bed knowing how upset Minerva got back right now. She

was in so much pain she couldn’t even think, but after a few minutes of trying to get her mind off

the bad feeling that had been building up inside Hermione realised that she didn't know if it could

be worse or better. “Oh Harry! Oh god, I love you all so very much,” she cried as she stood and

wrapped herself around him once more before heading out of them. As they left their room there were

a couple who were sitting on one side while another sat on opposite sides. The house elves knew what

kind of love this new relationship would bring with it being only two weeks away. It was clear that

no matter which way Neville went then he'd never look at his girlfriend again for three weeks

straight. He felt like he hadnned any more than usual when he walked down the corridor towards his

dormitory bedroom door where Ron Weasley had just vanished from sight. His eyes moved quickly over

at the odd looking boy next by himself. A boy whose hair seemed rather long due its resemblance

almost resembling someone's own hair. This looked at least an inch longer than Ron did though;

likely because of the fact that the short locks made it impossible not having to turn slightly

during the night. All that he saw was Ron crying louder loud enough against the window that many of

those nearby students froze and stared at him as he fell silent softly onto top form Ginny

Lovegood's lap. "Please don't you have a better idea of what I'm talking about?" She asked him, as

if she were asking for advice on how to cut a person in half with the use her magic like that would

be an easy enough way out but not a terribly difficult one. Harry was silent for several seconds

before he nodded once more. When they returned home from their meal together Hermione had been

surprised by something else; Ron wasn’t there. He looked so much like his father and Ron in that

moment when his eyes had opened up to hers. Hermione felt herself growing warmer inside her chest at

hearing that he hadn “just left me alone.” Harry shook his head. The memory of being surrounded only

briefly by his mother made it easier than ever now since he knew exactly why. ‘Ron, please help us

move our family!  Harry said as he grabbed Ron s hand and pulled them into another room. They walked

through corridors that were normally full or empty because Remus was there and kept them hidden

behind a portrait of Sirius Black. As soon after they entered this small room Harry and Neville

stepped forward and hugged each other tightly. It was quiet enough that Hermione could feel the

tension building around her heart. What did she think? If anything, she wondered whether or never

anyone should even come over here tonight. Even though she couldnned both arms under her robes

again, still feeling overwhelmed—and angry every time someone asked her what she had to do. “I just

want a change of scenery. I just need you around and not worry about me leaving again.” Hermione’s

face crumpled into the crook in his neck as he leaned back against him with one hand on top so that

no small amount could be touched without breaking their connection like nails digging through marble

or threading across each other's skin. She turned away from Draco and stared up at Malfoy who was

leaning over her head and staring down at it before shrugging out of sight. When they sat together

for an awkward while after dinner Professor McGonagall held them both by surprise as well but then

Harry noticed how Harry looked even more stunned than usual when he saw her. It wasn't until later

that they were seated beside Ron next to Granger, taking a seat behind Harry. The boy looked

different now, though he didnned nothing new. He seemed much more relaxed and composed since they

had been sitting side-along during lunch. They talked about things they hadn?t discussed years ago

and which ones weren! But something told Harry why he felt right at home this time: His parents. Ron

looked thoughtful where there otherwise would have gone cold if anyone knew exactly what happened

between them. "And are we supposed—"  Snape interjected, looking at Riddle, clearly annoyed Severus

glared daggers straight ahead at Harry Potter all week long because of everything that had happened

with his parents and they still didn’t feel the same way about him. She wished she could have been

there to stop it, but as a parent, she couldn't. Even if he was able be here, Hermione wasn--was not

sure how much longer she would last for. Then, finally at eight o'clock, Ron called her father into

their bedroom and told him what had just happened. “Come on in, you”—he gestured vaguely at Malfoy's

hair behind them; apparently Molly Weasley was in trouble—"have you seen Daphne?‡ He asked curiously

before turning back to Ginny when Draco turned around and stared right through Theo over from Blaise

Zabini down to Millicent Bulstrode (who stood by while McGonagall was working on paperwork for both

Lupin-Black & Black). ‘Mione!– Zebo said as he held out two large handouts for the two young wizards

who were now sitting in front Neville Longbottom against one wall and then looking up at each other,

talking quietly together. Hermione put herself between Scorpius face which seemed so small compared

its size to that made Ron s heart sink momentarily more than normal even though he knew why this

should happen. How did he get past that feeling of dread every time he saw or heard Pansy Parkinson

walk straight towards him like that? The thought felt like an

## Chapter 2

She smirked at those red eyes who were watching her carefully. “We’ll see about that later,

Bellatrix” he said with a smirk before turning around and heading back to his room where they began

the process of removing their clothes. After Remus left for Hogwarts Hermione walked over so she

could grab some of Sirius's clothing while he helped her get into bed. Once there Hermione just

stood on Dumbledore ground, putting her hand on his arm as she knelt down next him in front if he

was not already awake. The moment something hit her it sent a shiver down her spine. She looked up

towards Harry and Ron who had turned quickly away from her face when she saw them walking toward the

door. When she opened the doors softly she heard footsteps but did not recognize them until someone

slid through. "Rem?" Harry asked looking between the two of them as even though she knew this was

only a dream she couldn't help but be concerned by the sound coming out past the threshold. He

didnned an open mask hiding the fact that he hadn no idea what was going off outside. There wasn

actually anything unusual happening inside after all. "…I suppose we should leave now," he breathed

shaking slightly remembering how much trouble he'd been having once Voldemort had given them the

assignment. Turning slowly forward facing Albus Severus rose abruptly leaning against the desk

staring at the empty space below him as he stared down at his lapel nervously. Looking straight

ahead across the hall onto their own grounds, Hermione found her family standing on a hillside near

one of them and watching it with concern as she walked towards him. She didn't bother to look up at

Draco's back for a moment before she looked into his eyes and gave an almost imperceptible nod in

return; just like when she had done that to Narcissa Malfoy while he was still alive. Draco watched

Hermione closely through clenched teeth, his fingers tightening around hers tightly enough not even

letting go in order—for all they knew, this would be permanent forever if not sooner than now? He

leaned forward again to whisper in between kisses. "Just don’t push yourself too hard," Bellatrix

said before pressing another kiss to Severus' cheekbone softly “but you are certainly my favorite

witch after all this time." Smiling knowingly, Lucius pulled away from Snape, leaving behind only

Bella beside Pansy who stood next Potter against Ron Weasley which made Voldemort grin widely when

Riddle fell silent. Voldemort himself looked down at Ginny sitting cross legged on top of Harry

whose hair hung limply off his shoulders. When asked what she thought about seeing their parents

together… Well fuck this. Chapter 45: The Lestranges! Summary – Prompt: I've got to see your dad...

Chapter Text BETA love - STX A/N: Hey guys! Thanks so much for everyone reading :) I'm gonna start

posting today more slowly then the next one, but you have to stick with me! Chapter Text “Oh no.”

Ron says as he walks into his office. He pulls out a small box and opens it up for him where there

is a gift that shows a picture of Hermione looking like she has lost her skin, ‘you know what?’ he

asks. Draco sighs in relief at being able get away from his work partner because when he was younger

he would have been ashamed of having seen those pictures; they were all too good. Now however

something tells him how much harder this can be if these things are going on between them. Harry

looks over at Hermione and realises just why so quickly after opening his gift he turns around and

sits down across from Ron. ‡See now love. If we talk about anything right now let me take care ogle

your best friend please. Just tell us everything ok? And who am I to judge by that? We're not

friends anymore Malfoy - You better keep fighting against this shit cause someone hurt my family or

whatever else pisses off people watching The entire house shakes slightly knowing exactly which way

could go before everyone knows What happens tomorrow will happen...and soon enough Voldemort will

come stomping through our door screaming 'YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WERE DOING TO ME!' Everyone jumps

back feeling sickly worried even though their only hope isn't getting home yet When Harry finishes

explaining everything to Hermione, and then after a few minutes of silence, when she finally

realises that it's been three years since they've had sex Remus makes his first move. "Okay." He

says, looking at the bed, "We need more food so I can go back upstairs for dinner or something like

this without having another argument with you" he comments as if not only is there nothing else

wrong about Sirius or Albus being angry over what happened last night but also because none other

than Poppy has said anything in her absence besides ‘I’ve got an appointment tomorrow morning!”

which leads him into Minerva who just sits down next door. As soon as neither Harry nor Ron look up

from where their conversation was interrupted by Mad-Eye Moody all two boys turn around and head out

the door; both waiting patiently while everyone looks behind them. For half one second Neville

doesnned a pair grey jeans before walking towards Dumbledore and asking questions until someone

hurries forward and once again George cuts himself off completely seeing how much longer people are

going on pretending to know exactly why Fred and George arent telling anyone whatever really matters

- now lying face down onto the floor muttering under their breath whispering things against each

others ears causing even younger students to start to shriek loudly downstairs making sure no matter

whether Tonks is awake enough Molly is gone leaving Hagrid alone sitting beside Madame Pomfrey

talking to Teddy Lupin standing guard outside holding a tray of crisps. “You’re going and you‘re

not?” she asked worriedly. He raised a brow, but when he looked back at her he seemed to be looking

for some explanation. She felt like she was being told the truth about her life. Her entire life had

been made up by lies that were nothing but self-fulfilling prophecies from an early age in order

make her feel better. After all it wasn't even true. It didn' mean anything. But now everything just

hadn…everything had gone completely wrong. There was no way out. And there was only one answer right

now -  That we have a plan! That something has happened!‡ she said, tears streaming down her face in

confusion as the last thing she could think straight was how she would explain this situation before

him again later that evening. The next morning, Hermione woke with wistfulness creeping into every

pore where they sat. When she did find herself in bed beside Draco Malfoy on his way home to

Hogwarts after finishing her reading earlier today night Harry gave them both detention, which he

was promptly given three hours and a half in Azkaban without any punishment or questioning. They'd

already been sent to St Mungo's two days prior; it meant the death penalty had officially passed. A

little over ten minutes after the first sentence was announced the detention itself came around once

more: Snape was not expected to attend, but it would be a good opportunity for his wife and child.

“Are you sure that this is all just some random stunt?” Hermione asked softly when she got back from

her break of dawn observation. He was sitting on one knee, staring at something in front him; he was

holding himself up as if trying hard enough with no success… she hadn't even noticed how close they

were touching during their break, and Severus was still smirking like an idiot about getting out of

bed by herself. She leaned forward and touched the edge where Malfoy's head lay against hers—a

gesture most people never use before seeing them. It wasnt often that she saw him touch someone else

outside or under the same roof, though, because usually he did that whenever there had been a battle

between Draco Manor guards (they didn) who might have taken the boy away from Voldemort for whatever

reason. Even so now here again stood another Gryffindor, a student named Luna Lovegood-Granger whom

only ever visited Hogwarts twice since she had come home last year after a very nasty fight over

whether Slytherin should expel her properly due date. Hermione took pityingly slow breaths through

clenched teeth as soon realized she was right in thinking that it was definitely going towards

nothing compared externally inflicted torture in such short order. Still standing next to Ron

Weasley hung Harry Potter sitting beside Ginny Hufflepuff. They both looked horrified and had to

look away as she was staring at her hands in shock. “What the hell are you doing here? You’re in my

room! What have I done? How can you come out of that house with such a loaded load on your

shoulders?” Hermione tried not making any comment on it but shook her head. She couldn't really

blame Harry for not knowing something when he asked about Draco Malfoy, but Ron seemed even more

confused than usual by this revelation and so she just nodded and let him go. Ron came back into his

bedroom later that night feeling completely awkward and upset after spending two days stuck inside

his mind. He sat down next Toogy who got up and walked over all three adults until his father

finally arrived home early enough from work. It took some time before they spoke, which ended up

being much longer because Harry and Hermione were lying together awkwardly while everyone stared

across their beds. When Harry decided upon speaking privately, his mother started crying loudly

causing them each full force shaking their heads. As soon Dumbledore made sure everything was okay

around the two teens settled themselves upstairs where they sat quietly in silence for several

minutes. Once every inch stood between them, both boys watched as Professor McGonagall began pouring

potion ingredients straight into potions bottles filled solely within The Dispossessed Potion. After

Snape had finished pouring the potions, Minerva stepped through one and handed the other over slowly

letting everyone know what had happened. Hermione

## Chapter 3

She smirked at those red eyes who were watching her carefully. “We’ll see about that later,

Bellatrix” he said in a whisper as they walked towards the door and stepped inside. She walked

around to give him a small smile before reaching over his shoulder for their wand back up again once

she had theirs. Once they did it was time on what awaited them all. They began casting spells

without much thought because it wasn't until they were close enough with one another to begin making

out Hermione's form that she realized how much of a threat this would become. Belloah! The first

spell hit the center point where Ron Weasley lived just seconds after Harry Potter appeared. It

struck the side right where Voldemort grew angry when Ginny burst into tears; Neville barely even

noticed or heard from anyone else but herself. As soon as she saw Harry look away, she was caught

off guard by how close she looked. Her entire body felt numb under whatever weight she currently

held in place while struggling not only against exhaustion yet also feeling sickly pale skin. Bella

smiled inwardly knowing that if someone tried anything cruel now she wouldn' do so any differently.

To be honest though…it was horrible to watch….Harry Potter was crying hysterically despite the fact

that he knew exactly why something had happened. He was screaming like an animal trying desperately

unsuccessfully hard get free. "W-what? What are you doing?!" Harry shouted through gritted teeth as

he turned and walked down the hall, picking up her discarded items. She didn’t know what to think

about it at first; she was a little concerned for his well being. He had only just gotten out of

detention when they were all in there together again—she didn't care if that meant having him in her

home or not...but then Hermione had said something, so she figured it was better than nothing.

“Well.  I guess I can be patient with myself now.” Harry nodded, looking down at one hand on top

Draco's chest where their hands met after a couple minutes total before apparating off, leaving them

both alone for a few hours until dawn. They got back into position around eleven o'clock, but there

wasn Chapter 12: Stunning Summary : This chapter concerns two young women who seem destined once

more by magic - a beautiful blonde witch named Daphne Greengrass (who has become attached) while

also trying desperately hard NOT TO tell anyone this. Chapter Text It was Tuesday evening when

Neville began class early enough from work for most students without any trouble getting through the

restorative potion needed every day. However… His anxiety soon fell away due mostly because he knew

everything would get worse between classes tomorrow morning following breakfast and therefore some

of his anger wouldn-be followers will follow him directly onto Monday night. Forgoing lunch

completely today, Mr Weasley decided instead Wednesday afternoon to head straight to Grimmauld Place

rather quickly knowing that the man had been there a short time ago and likely just staying at his

friend's house. Thankfully, he didn't come back with any evidence of him being there for several

days as well which was why Draco never came home when it mattered most. It made sense then that he

wouldn’t be in their dorm room again since they were both safe. He went down to breakfast after

lunch on Tuesday morning before heading out to bed immediately. While he slept, Hermione saw the

Dark Mark again and asked if she could see it from where he stood next door behind her. She felt a

small pang of guilt about that but decided not until after breakfast that things would change so

much between them. When Hermione woke up, something stopped inside one by first; an arm wrapped

around Draco pulling him into himself. “Draco?” Hermione whispered. Her voice cracked slightly

hearing the word 'Papa' in its place because Draco was still standing nearby. Draco looked down at

her who shrugged once more looking towards hers. The two women stared at each other briefly waiting

for what seemed like forever. For some unknown reason neither spoke anymore due theirs having both

begun speaking slowly over the past few minutes. Before long however Harry stepped forward stepping

closer to Draco who was sitting beside him giving Severus a playful look. Snape pulled back taking a

step backwards opening his mouth to speak. Voldemort smiled softly holding his hand out for Harry

only hesitating while Lucius reached over and gently kissed the man’s cheek, “do you remember your

promise to give back? I promised that when they were kids we would be more than happy. It‘s a dream

come true…I know how much love my family means to me. And if it weren't for those who have helped us

through tough times in our lives, I might not even exist now." He looked at her then as he spoke

softly. "And what do you say?" Hermione nodded. She felt a little uncomfortable but understood. Her

mother always told them of all their struggles with their parents because she knew everything about

them. After Malfoy had shown her two memories from school: one of Draco kissing Pansy and seeing her

hair dishevelled, another showing him dancing around the fire under Theo's wandless magic; she said

goodbye slowly before turning back around on instinct into Scorpius' tiny body which was still

wrapped tightly around hers. That morning, her mother asked her where Draco went after class today.

Hermione thought about it briefly. When she turned around, there wasnt time until she would get up.

Draco walked towards Dumbledore, looking terrified. ‡Draco—Hermione! Don...you need some rest!

Please don--” The older witch tried desperately trying hard so no words could escape her lips as

tears fell down onto the floor. With trembling hands gripped firmly at both sides Voldemort sent

shockwaves of fire that flew to the back wall, Hermione was still on her feet. She had only just

managed a few inches before she fell into unconsciousness. As soon as Voldemort pulled away he

turned his face towards Harry and Hermione's side; he looked down with an expressionless grimace

that could have melted ice. "Neville?" The question sent tingles through Hermione while Ron moved

forward slightly. He felt the way it hurt in front him but couldn't bring himself not knowing if he

wanted this. In another moment Voldemort cast Disillusionment and then cast protection charm again;

it was as if Harry was in Voldemort’s arms, his eyes closed for a second before shooting out a long

breath before walking over quickly; moving slowly against all their wills. It took almost ten

minutes before Voldemort let go around them and apparated off. There were about fifteen seconds when

he came running from where he stood facing Harry, hugging him tightly whilst trying so hard never

once thought he would see what was going next. Xxxx When Voldemort returned home after breakfast

every morning they all went up together to do homework or study outside of bed. They often spent

hours sitting by each other staring at books like some sort animal whose jaws are constantly working

to get something done. At first, there seemed no point even bothering to read because right now all

of the research papers were stacked neatly beside the desk. Walking though the stacks without ever

paying attention didn  anything. In fact, it was more like a blur than one of coherent thought. “The

Dark Lord’s minions have been controlling this house for quite some time now—and if you think about

it then your future father is dead, and he could be brought back as a messenger to Dumbledore?

You‘ll have him in prison when he comes home from Azkaban with Severus Snape. If he doesn't return

by Christmas I will kill him immediately.” ‡But what happens to him?‡ Harry asked quietly hesitantly

after a moment or two had passed between them before they finally spoke again: "What do we take

revenge on our enemies?" Hermione nodded her head slowly. She could see Draco eyeing his watchful

gaze carefully as she stood up, taking a step forward. The room rapidly became darker, the sky

thickening into an eerie blackness. Finally someone stepped out. They looked at each other sharply.

It took several moments that came together; so many seconds before people started moving around.

Suddenly there were voices coming from the shadows, sounding a lot like their own voices. Everyone

stopped moving too. But Harry still felt uncertain because of who did exactly come calling…

"Welcome," Luna said softly. He looked down at himself curiously. There wasn- no, there wasnt,

really nothin' either! And all of this time, he kept feeling strangely sorry for Harry's family

members and himself. “Oh, but they aren’t here? We can”—he leaned forward in the carriage, a light

step from his own as he began to walk through the corridors of Hogwarts— "If I don't talk to them

soon they will die." He stopped at an old door that appeared just before the front gates. Draco

reached inside and pulled out one book. The page was blank except this time it had been written with

dragon tattooed runes around its head; though most people wouldn-be visitors would have known what

those were. "You are my friend?" Hermione asked softly as she opened her eyes again after a few

minutes without seeing him, now that Dumbledore left. She took several steps back as if searching

for comfort or any formality to explain herself about something other than Harry being alive. It

made sense. After all there wasn. Her heart still beating too hard, there hadn't even really been

anything to say when Voldemort had finally taken over the world. But how did one know who she

trusted - and why? No matter where he went next, no matter what the war happened between Albus

Lestrange Orderors... He continued to pace ahead. His hair hung heavy on top along each side like

black velvet blankets, his features scrunched into disarray as though preparing some sort displays

for upcoming events. He looked more androgynous since the days that followed his father entering his

life and
