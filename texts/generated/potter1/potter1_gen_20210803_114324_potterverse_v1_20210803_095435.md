'“Oh, fuck this,” Bellatrix says. “Here’s how it is, pet. You can either'

## Chapter 1

“Oh, fuck this,” Bellatrix says. “Here’s how it is, pet. You can either do something or you will

just leave and find a new one right here.  She pulls out her wand and casts the spell, so that the

little girl sitting next to her can get comfortable on top of her now covered legs with them without

having any trouble getting under the covers in time. Bella doesn't move at first as she hears Draco

laugh, but after about ten seconds she does finally raise an eyebrow at him before dropping onto his

back where he was holding her hands instead while on her knees facing her lover. The tiny witch

starts sobbing when she sees the baby face being taken off of Hermione while she watches from behind

her. Hermione begins slowly thrusting into the young woman until she reaches two fingers inside and

holds both hands over the small baby. She takes hold for once then gives a loud moan which causes

her body temperature increase slightly causing Hermione's breath quickens. After three minutes all

Hermione feels is a slight warmth around her finger again making sure no matter what happens there

won not be anyone else touching underneath her skin even if they wanted someone to touch their hair

down below her eyebrows. For some reason Bella has never been more happy since seeing Harry near

Remus' house like this because everything seems fine between them except...oh wait..she had seen

enough? In fact, every day ever by far became much worse than normal considering who they were. She

couldn’t do anything about it now, even though she was sure that he was going to get hurt from it.

Hermione tried not to think about the fact Malfoy would be angry at her for being so stupid and

stubborn in his attempts of trying just to protect him. What if he found out? Maybe after what they

had done, he would actually try something else, but there wasn't any way around this yet. Why

hadn—she didn- “Hermione! Please don—" He stopped mid sentence, looking up sharply as though daring

anyone outside Harry's house or hospital wards beyond an instinctual response. ”I can t wait

anymore—‘Please don” He began softly again before pushing away fully. He turned back towards Draco

and Draco held his gaze with narrowed eyes until almost a minute later when Ron reappeared. Draco

swallowed heavily; he stared back at them for several seconds. Finally all their attention came on

Neville through Ginny Weasley sending hexes directly into Mr Potter‡s head, hitting both men hard in

each shoulder where Snape knelt beside Severus like some sort of cruel joke shield charm - leaving

his arm completely vulnerable. Ron pushed himself off and looked down at Seamus once more. When

everyone turned to see Hermione standing next hand over faceless faced Gryffindor boy staring

blankly at Professor Slughorn, Dean Thomas stood between two tall figures whose only expression was

one of disgust. The man had been a stranger to Hermione, the death eater's aunt. She didn't know

what she could do about it now that he'd stepped out on her doorstep—but they needed him anyway and

he would be there for them. His eyes were wide with shock. “What the hell is this?” Harry whispered

in his ear as Tom strode over towards their table where several people sat around chairs. He spun

through the crowd, eager enough not even Granger or Goyle have noticed before they came into view.

Her face remained blank but when she turned back to look at Draco Malfoy again something flashed

across her face; anger seethed within its depths like an earthquake while deep pools spilled from

her temples. Hermione cast another glance up which caused both men gazes locked, though they watched

the scene intently as Potter continued speaking. "I apologize for making you wait," Severus said

softly, taking his seat behind him next door so no onlookers could see. "…are we leaving?" Kingsley

asked quietly then paused. A moment later Sirius spoke. As he moved away Harry looked down sharply

and saw just how close the others were. Neville Longbottom was standing beside Lee Jordan who seemed

pleased by being alone among himself while Ron Weasley appeared confused and distant, eyes narrowed

until nothing more than dried tears formed on either side except silver smoke-filled mouths pressed

together tightly into fists. Everyone stared at each other, staring blankly at the floor for a few

moments before looking up to see Harry Potter standing in his bed. “What’s wrong?” he asked quietly

as Harry opened and closed one eye watching him sleep slowly. He could tell that it was

uncomfortable, but after some time they relaxed. Draco saw them both look back down at their

blankets and then moved over towards him. Harry stood there, the dark circles on those around him

pale against grey. The Dark Lord had been so angry with himself when he found out about Hermione

Granger, he knew what was going through her mind. Even though Voldemort had killed someone like Lily

Evans, people still thought she deserved more than what Ron did because of how she had betrayed him,

and even if he didn't know anything else about it; just knowing now that he had done something

unforgivable meant that the Dark Mark would end too soon, not sooner than possible. As Draco sat

there silently thinking of everything she said or did during this week alone without being able

either consciously or subconsciously communicate any emotion away from herself she suddenly felt

sick feeling like he was dying. She let out a sob running down her face as he turned to face her and

lay down beside her on top off Severus Snape kneeling next only to lean forward slightly resting his

forehead against hers Severus' hands rested on arms and placed one hand on her chest while another

pressed against soft skin on its way between legs Severus laid the boy flat in his lap and then

pressed his lips to Lucius's. "Do you want to know why I'm asking this?" He asked softly, as if that

was the easiest thing in existence "I don't care about your answer" he whispered Draco murmured

Severus nodded. It was only a matter of time before it got out there so they could try again. If not

for him being here at Hogwarts right now Severus could have sworn Lucius was already on their knees;

kneeling by them and kissing them passionately. Feeling the heat start towards release Severus let

go but soon found himself distracted with what Hermione did next - rolling over to face her Severus

watched as she slowly began undoing each of Harry’s buttons. Slowly working Harry's cock into place

with one hand while making sure everything remained steady And finally Harry was fucking his

prostate hard Severus smirked down playfully and took a deep breath before slipping back up to meet

Lucius' eye just above Snape'. The two wizards shared another kiss. Gripping Harry tightly around

both nipples, giving an extra inch every few minutes Severus moved forward slightly and kissed the

heady scent from underneath. Using some more pressure, bringing his hips further closer than ever

before But instead all three men lost their hold and came thrusting through the hole fully. Lucius

moaned loudly, feeling his orgasm hitches Severus pushed past him and slid inside Harry without

hesitation or warning hitting Harry harder. In fact when he felt his wand tip into her hand he could

feel it gliding up and down as he concentrated on getting the spell to work properly. “You can’t do

this,” Draco said with a sneer of disgust at Hermione for what she had done. Harry laughed loudly

and kissed him softly. He was sure that if he were not careful enough about that then Hermione would

curse him because he just hadn't thought clearly in weeks. As far back they knew nothing happened

between them until after the second task ended. They went out together and got ready to go home

early but upon seeing each other again later that day, Harry was confused by how quickly things had

changed. When he woke up without any help from Hermione or Ron there wasn immediately anything else

left. It was only minutes before they came across something that reminded them so much more than

anything earlier. A long black box hanging over their bedside table that hung open like an old

clock. On top sat two of Pansy's favourite books, one of which appeared inside though he didn tuck

it away. The book looked as beautiful now? Wasn' anyone going see it? Or is that just some random

pixie thing? "Oh," Harry frowned, trying hard against pain along where the cauldron was resting.

This time however Potter couldn hardly hear himself being called around, even while breathing

heavily. "What are you reading?" Something in Severus Snape voice interrupted them both; it was the

only time they had spoken with each other since then. "What is it, Hermione? Did I hurt you or

what?" He asked her slowly and she could tell he wasn't sure where this conversation went. She

didn’t know why she wanted to talk about it but she felt like it might be a good idea if people were

going at all. “I think it would be prudent not so much that we stay out of our lives for too long

without knowing how things are progressing...or being involved in something more than one way. We

have two families now, and there's no family who can make us feel safe anymore. That means we should

always try again.” There must come an end to their relationship soon, because Granger was

practically crying on his face as she stared into tears. It was odd but also amazing how many times

Draco Malfoy stopped talking to anyone when watching her cry over someone‘s shoulder. And finally

Blaise had said the right thing—she couldn 'ave any ideas'. Chapter 24: The Tale Of A Choked Past

## Chapter 2

“Oh, fuck this,” Bellatrix says. “Here’s how it is, pet. You can either wait and try to do something

today or tomorrow, now. I know what you want but we have to be ready for the day when your cock

starts calling me that name. It‘ll make everything better so let  you go get dressed Hermione!‡ she

moans, holding up her hand as she grabs a handful of fabric from behind Hermione who pulls at her

skirt. Hermione slowly steps away from Bella before getting onto her knees beside the witch and

straddling her, wrapping her arms around herself making sure there are no other traces of Bellati in

between them, placing a kiss on the top lip of his head. The witch growls into Hermione's mouth

pushing outwards grabbing hold again pulling him closer with her hands moving against his face and

kissing back gently sucking on his nipple enjoying every second of it, then breathing hard almost

driving off the pain within himself. She whispers to herself feeling like he might never come until

well after they were both naked without even trying, hearing each one being loud and full of desire

through their bodies. Once done, Hermione puts her lips to Voldemort causing him not only look down

at them but once more leaning over Harry to suck at his bottom lip painfully which causes him eyes

wide open. He looks completely lost staring at Hermione watching her body grind slightly looking

pale blue orbs meet the dark circles swirling about inside of her. "I'm not," she said, a little

breathless as he stepped closer to hers and kissed her deeply through his nose before moving back

around slightly to kiss her more softly. She felt the warmth travel up into herself from behind her

shoulder so quickly that it took all Hermione could do at once for him even second-guessing himself.

He was just standing there, facing her, watching the world spin with a deep fascination. Her heart

stopped beating when she saw Draco standing right next to Ron's bed in one piece on top off an open

window sill. His face looked like something outfitting underwear, but Hermione wondered if his eyes

were a reflection or merely part mirror to see what they were. The urge burned through her veins

then flared up again. A single tear slid down her cheek and wiped her lips; thankfully Harry had

come home earlier than usual and didn't seem upset by seeing Ron at the house alone. When another

burst appeared in front them both Ginny rushed over to where their friends stood and got their

things ready; Draco already sat beside Lucius and Luna while Malfoy pulled on Hermione’s panties

first thing this morning after doing some research about how many muggle children sleep in locked

rooms. They waited patiently until Neville had gotten dressed before setting them on Fred—who only

seemed worriedly concerned because no matter what happened, Hermione was sure Ginny would make sure

she put on her best clothes soon enough. Draco followed suit and left the house in haste, taking her

to Grimmauld Place with a heavy heart. He was glad that she wasn’t dead and he felt like it was time

for his family back to their normal lives again instead of going down the same road as before when

they got to Hogwarts where everyone knew about him being on Riddle's side but not Granger or Daphne

who had been looking out at them all day. When Draco walked into Diagon Alley while Hermione still

slept, he could see Lucius walking towards him trying so hard just waiting for him there until his

eyes watered for even a second before closing his mouth behind Bellatrix Lestrange saying “Slytherin

has no idea what he”. Lucius seemed surprised by this statement and said nothing more than sighing.

‘Do you want me? I can always ask if my mother is alright...†he began thinking. Snape came around

the corner from Flourish & Blotts and asked what had happened between Umbridge; Hermione and Malfoy

as well Harry s father and Severus. They were both talking quietly after an hour spent staring at

each other and Draco looked over his shoulder curiously wondering why Luna Lovegood would be sitting

next to someone so obviously mad. Severus rose from his chair and took a drink from one half cup

which lay neatly in front Sirius Black whose portrait held two glasses of wine in hand and Theo

Potter who sat in silence beside him. "How's the baby?" Hermione asked. Draco nodded and took his

daughter into a hug, which he couldn't help but smile at. She smiled back at her father as she

spoke. It wasn’t long before Draco found himself with a cup of tea from Blaise Zabini, along side

Pansy Parkinson."Hermione, what have you been doing here?" Neville asked, glancing over to where

Ginny was sitting. He pulled away briefly so that Blanche could speak to Pany. “I thought you were

taking us up on this offer because I wanted my husband there, not you; I can tell you how much we

want it.” ‘I don!  Harry exclaimed. The four children burst out laughing uncontrollably when they

heard their mother call them names. They moved around crying openly while Paddy looked sad. After

seeing Ginny s face for only an instant, they hurried down the stairs to meet Luna Lovegood. Luna

had offered several wonderful gifts during term break each year, all of whom included her own

handmade Christmas tree, one that would grow fruit every three days. However many of those would be

purchased by Hermine, and most didn just give her happy memories. Their favorite was apparently

something that went against everything she believed in—it reminded her about herself, everything

about her life since school ended almost twenty years ago now… ‡So, let me guess, you’ve been

working on the same project since then? I know what you want, Draco.” “You want to spend your free

time with Harry and Ron all day?  ‘I don't think so,  he said, trying not his cheeks be flushed. He

was smiling at her. Hermione could see that she was turning a very hard shade of red from being

around him, but it had already begun seeping into every line in their faces. Draco was standing

there, his mouth agape, waiting for something like this happened; but nothing came out. Instead they

looked back at each other before pulling away. She realised that it hadn- It wasn—not realisable

anymore - it felt almost real how much she wanted them gone. ‏Sorry about my hair! How is it? You

did great today, Hermione Granger... he chuckled,  but it doesn  look good right now!‪ The moment

they were both done talking quickly Malfoy walked towards where Daphne stood and pointed to Blaise

who sat next to Theo sitting next up behind her leaning against Pansy as well. Blinking open his

eyes when he saw Hermione staring at him: he glanced down between them and smiled widely. If he ever

found himself looking at Paddy, he would never have called herself an arsehole again. His lips

quirked upwards slightly as he thought about the fact that his witch had been so eager to get him

out of her arse. She’d gotten a good deal more than she could handle before, and she was excited for

an eventual punishment like this from Lucius Malfoy in return...but not when it involved something

far less severe! The girl seemed intent on getting through him first, which meant licking him clean

up and then sucking back at any hint or taste of pleasure; she even looked pleased with herself.

That might have worked with Snape…maybe they should just work on things with Harry? She had only

ever come to terms while enjoying her own punishments, but she knew he wouldn't mind if someone else

did, especially after all those years together. Perhaps he could send them off to join forces with

Draco Malfoy and Professor McGonagall to try again sometime soon? She was sure Severus would be

keenly aware of their involvement. The question still hung over Hermione's head, however: what

exactly were they going down?  Would one night during lunch break bring some sort ‘pleasure relief'?

Or is there a limit?! What do you think? Notes - Thanks to everyone who commented below :) Chapter

Clark. https://mvh-youtube). Day 3 (NSFW Prompt #23) – May 20th 1987 Dear readers, I'm posting these

prompt responses for my son's first book. It came out in 1986 and has been passed around since then

(it was published by Harper & Row). My story is a comedy about two middle-aged married women who

have just met when their kids are little boys. They are both very smart wizards with great taste of

magic that they love to teach others things which makes them attractive to other people because of

their intelligence and good looks…and even though the couple are extremely intelligent children no

one can really tell whether or not this is true until it becomes too embarrassing for all involved….

Well, we did our best as an innocent pair so how does anyone know if Harry Potter’s parents are

real? We didn't ask you specifically but he looked much better than his Dad! You should see what

kind of guy Draco Malfoy thinks Granger could be: handsome, funny looking wizarding family man with

a lot going on behind her back, and a big hearted Christian who wants to make everyone happy...which

will never happen again after Hogwarts....so please let me hear your thoughts; i don' think any of

us want to ever lose sight—but yes, there are some pretty intriguing parallels between ourselves and

him here at home...I guess someday soon someone from Gryffindor might get over Draco Malfoys

reputation..oh wait...no longer would Muggles think twice before saying "We're joking" unless those

were the words of Professor Snape himself lol

## Chapter 3

“Oh, fuck this,” Bellatrix says. “Here’s how it is, pet. You can either bend over the bed and start

rubbing yourself like a child on top of your boyfriend, or you could show her to my room where you

are sitting in front me. I will be there waiting for that request later. The only thing preventing

me from doing both is that I have no control over what she likes so I won't even notice if she tells

something, which would explain why Hermione looks such intense right now against mine!‡ Bellace

starts as she notices another pair down by the door. They reach into their pocketed robes and pull

out a small silver and gold pouch. After filling up with air first they all turn to leave. Hermione

turns back to Bella, who flushes slightly before nodding and standing at Draco once more. He takes

it off and then opens his mouth but he looks directly at him instead when suddenly Harry and Ron

stop them, all wondering exactly whom had gotten stuck onto this little Muggle thing. Looking around

confusion, confusion being an understatement, and panic rising along with it. "Mione?" Ron asks,

looking between the two. Hearing that Hermione quickly moves away from him, putting her hand on

Sirius's shoulder, because while she knows nothing of anything about Remus, neither does she know

any better than hearing Neville call Ginny Weasley."Ron says with a frown. Knowing just yet too much

already Molly, Fred & George. So that was it then? It was the one thing Ron could really do with no

friends left in his life. He felt bad for all those who had lost their way and he didn’t like to

feel sorry for anyone else involved. That was what Draco wanted to hear as well; that people were

doing good things but at the same time, they were going through a tough period of times. “Well I

guess we should go back home now…we need some sleep or something Harry. Did you guys have any idea

how long our conversation went down this morning?” Hermione asked worriedly looking up from her

napkin nervously while she looked around frantically trying not come across anything so odd. Draco

nodded thoughtfully before pulling out a book about friendship tips and techniques. "Yeah?" Harry

asked him turning over the book briefly tilting its pages on page number six. There wasn't enough

information here because there wasn' any sort'relationship' between them whatsoever. Harry sat up

slowly nodding slightly leaning into the chair shaking his head shakily waiting until Hermione

finished writing everything down. The two of them got dressed feeling somewhat comfortable since

they hadn's been working together relatively recently thinking more clearly than usual after having

spent most of the day discussing topics involving dating and other stuff. Hermione found herself

sitting next Neville standing by himself reading several books coming towards us every few minutes

talking about their upcoming new relationship or even being close to him, he decided that it was

best for her first time with Draco. He didn't want this conversation going any further than they

already had in the past. His head spun as he spoke of how excited his little girl would be and

Hermione's reaction when she saw him once again. "Yes?" She asked, looking up at Harry. Harry

nodded. Her face flushed brighter while he took a breath before continuing on. “I’m sorry I wasn—had

a hard day today," Voldemort said after a moment more silence before finally letting go completely

feeling guilt over his actions. When everyone had returned to Hogwarts, Severus Snape sat down next

them and bowed formally touching his daughter who was currently crying. There were only two hours

left until dinner so he could spend all evening worrying over how he should proceed tonight. Notes:

WARNINGS: Sexually explicit content, sexual scenarios involving pregnancy and forced sex (See the

end notes.) Chapter Text Even though Hermione didnt like the idea but she knew by now that there

must have been something else behind what he'd done…something she couldn no longer control. After

much consideration both Dumbledore himself admitted defeat and begged for forgiveness from Narcissa

Malfoy; however despite the pain that was surely soon set upon her, nothing truly had changed

between them since then. Not even an hour later, Lucius entered the room and immediately pushed open

the door leading out onto grounds without asking permission. They sat together in silent agreement,

wondering what the hell was going on. When Hermione took a deep breath and thought about it again

she realized that if someone asked her why they were there she would get defensive; ask them to wait

for an explanation but not give her any reason as to why. She looked at Bellatrix who had her wand

drawn out of nowhere while reading while Ron stood watching her with his eyes on him like he didn't

want anyone seeing their house-elf so much (this was something Draco used quite often). She turned

her head slightly when thinking of the other witch’s reactions and then began staring at each one of

hers curiously while making sure no one noticed her actions. It was only after five minutes when

Malfoy finally stopped looking at her and moved back down to listen. “Draco?” Harry said quietly as

he walked over from where he sat next to Narcissa sitting on top towards Snape standing beside

Lucius studying Snape. He watched as Severus slowly let go off the hand holding his wand until just

before Voldemort spoke and entered the room with great calmness of mind. The moment he had stepped

inside the bedroom he saw that he could see everyone else but himself standing under glass; watching

them. "We mustn't say anything! What is it?" Snape asked as the others filed into silence. There

seemed almost too much tension between them all now. Draco narrowed his gaze up trying desperately

hard enough even though the pressure was beginning to make her skin crawl. Her knuckles were pale

and aching as she tried not to feel the cold sweat of pain on his face, that had been burning for

hours. He had pushed them away from her when he saw her look down at him again in desperation before

turning around and pulling her up against Ron who looked like an animal, something so raw it hurt

Hermione's eyes if Harry hadn't noticed with how wet she was writhing beneath her until he reached

out towards touch herself gently. She felt his fingers caressing her jawbone, teasing her nipples

just slightly, but she didn’t move back or let go, not after what they were doing now; there

wasn...there was no way anymore. “I don…” she hesitated momentarily between Draco Malfoy grabbing

one shoulder and pushing him off her. His hand was shaking harder than she remembered ever feeling

before and this time she couldn- she could barely hold still looking into his brown eyes which were

becoming unnaturally dark as they watched Ron‘s hands being shoved forward once more. Ron stood

frozen staring down into their hands. The way he looked at her made her heart leap painfully because

she knew all too well why he was standing here right where she stood next? It took every ounce -

every single ounce – everything else remaining inside of hers that she wanted to hide behind. But

instead, she held onto nothing. Just the promise Granger kept saying goodbye meant nothing. It was a

big deal, and she didn’t want to lose it for any reason other than the love of her life or because

this would all be over soon. Draco watched as Hermione's face contorted in concern before he spoke

again: “I know I said goodbye to you too late, but..  Do let me ask what you were doing when we went

out to dinner together last night?” His brows furrowed, not bothering with his own guilt. ‘No!  He

shook his head at that thought slowly; he had been tempted by seeing if they could do anything more

pleasant between them—to make her happy—but instead…well...it wasn't quite right either way so here

comes him now knowing she couldn- Not like that. He started walking towards where Harry sat on one

side next to Ron, so he got close enough (at least slightly) away from her just enough near Snape

who stood closest behind him, taking it into account. The taller man looked down at their joined

hands with an almost amused smile. "Draco," Ron whispered against hers once they reached their feet

again amidst awkwardness about how much to give and whether Severus wanted something else entirely.

A few minutes later Malfoy started to walk further back up to join Hermione, thinking about things

that had happened since then that he hadn't noticed until now. Things that were different today.

When he saw the expression of his friend's eyes, Draco was stunned to find out what it meant for

him. What would happen if he left Hermione? Would she be able or unwilling enough in order not get

involved with anyone else, and what would they do? How would those people react when they discovered

who she really belonged on this earth- after only a few months at Hogwarts by himself... He had

never once wanted her alone with him, but then again - how could he ever want her as well - even

though he knew there was nothing wrong with having an intimate relationship with one someone? That

made sense from their own perspective because Tom Riddle was a Slytherin, so many things about him

that he did not like to dwell upon. It also might have been wise given where we are right now, since

Dumbledore had taken over while Voldemort remained alive: considering everything Snape has said

regarding relationships between students and teachers in school (including sex), I am inclined

towards thinking that Severus Snape is more than just someone to take care of these days. There is

something much darker happening inside me too; despite all my years working hard for equality,

seeing Ron and Hermione together before finally falling behind during her time at the Ministry

wasn't helping. She still felt ashamed both for being angry at them, because every time everyone

around her got hurt through anger at some student or professor, Harry Potter took away whatever

little advantage possible… "Hermione!" Blaise called
