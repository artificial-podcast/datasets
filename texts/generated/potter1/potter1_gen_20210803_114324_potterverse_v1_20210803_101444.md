## Chapter 1

She smirked at those red eyes who were watching her carefully. “We’ll see about that later,

Bellatrix” he said after a moment of silence as he continued to walk towards the doors until they

opened and the other two emerged into an empty hallway. Belladonna was already waiting for them in

front by herself and she couldn't help but grin when Hermione saw how close Narcissa had come to

closing behind her. With her hair out of place and her face blank in terror, though it still hurt

from being so close, her mother had just stood there with her arms around hers holding both hands up

in surrender as she placed one hand on either side their shoulders giving him no resistance, ‘I love

you Bella! I loved you before everyone else did!  Bella gasped slightly hearing this and grabbed her

arm pulling her back enough for her father sitting beside her where she sat down next to her

daughter, with a slight frown crossing her lips telling her not only didnt want to be alone with

Andromeda anymore but also because once again, even if she came here now, nothing would change

anything between them or anyone besides Harry, Molly could do much more than speak for all the

people affected right across England. She moved away taking a deep breath trying desperately hope

that something might change within themselves soon knowing full well what kind will happen anyways.

When she finally heard Dumbledore's voice calling through the door leaning against the barrier

breaking open completely shutting off everything inside of Hogwarts. It was a miracle that they

couldn’t see anything, because the first thing a Death Eater did after witnessing their horrific

torture and torture by Voldemort in front his followers would be to cast one last spell at them, and

then he could apparate back into hiding, no matter how much the Order had worried about him for the

past few months when Harry Potter finally told them what had happened as well—if it weren't for

Dumbledore giving up on Harry so easily. “You look like you were a fool,” Bellatrix reminded

Hermione from her spot beside her as she reached out towards Draco who quickly shook his head in

response before turning around and placing both hands over Bella's face while whispering sweet

words. At the same time Narcissa turned to stare up at Snape. He had looked slightly annoyed with

himself but looking down at Lucius and Severus Snape, who seemed fine despite themselves all this

year since he had been captured and tortured. They had felt some relief knowing that everyone knew

where Voldemort stood and now that he hadna thought about it. Chapter 24: The Dark Lord Revealed

mistakes or misunderstandings regarding this chapter! Enjoy (See the end notes.) Chapter Text After

hearing the announcement of Hagrid being released during school break, it took two weeks until Snape

spoke again; just an hour ago. Later that day in class which was all he had planned, Snape finished

the first course and began to teach the next one while Harry took a break from studying. After

dinner his roommates decided they would return to their rooms after breakfast so they left him alone

for two more hours before heading down to bed. Once inside he tried not to think about what he knew

going on but it didn't help that she seemed upset at having missed dinner with Malfoy. He noticed

that Ginny looked happy too and apparently thinking about it made her feel even better. "Okay I'm

done," Hermione said as she sat up looking at Draco who just shrugged and turned around walking

towards them laughing. When they arrived back into Gryffindor tower where there were no other

students leaving, Ron noticed something odd. His eyes widened seeing his friend smiling shyly across

from her. It was his turn of saying hello when they heard Harry and Neville's voices coming out of

nowhere behind them. Ron straightened himself quickly standing staring at Ron realising how much

time had passed by now, especially since everything he did had been far less than necessary. Before

long he could see the two older Slytherins sitting together enjoying each others company as they

walked over every detail of Hogwarts. As soon as Harry came onto the platform, the group began

making their way through corridors leading away from Hogwarts until finally reaching the entrance

hall right ahead near Hogsmeade. The path led directly toward a large fireplace waiting area being

lit up by a small pair of torches. "How is it, Lunae?" Draco asked as they waited for the fire to

fully ignite. He had noticed that several people were watching them closely and so he didn't have

much time before his eyes flew open. Hermione and Luna came out from behind their ladders with

little fussings on their faces. She hugged her friends tightly while she sat in front where there

was an enormous oak table and two chairs over which tables lined various kinds but none could stand

more than three witches or wizards sitting together and not be properly lit without making them

blush. After all this war has been going on, it wouldn’t be too long before the flames would start

to burn away again. It seemed like ages since anyone else had burned something at Hogwarts. They

stared at each other in surprise when Narcissa walked forward one last time. “You donned your robes?

That's quite fitting, aren I right Malfoy?!" Bella smirked slightly at her friend who sat down next

to him proudly wearing red and gold chains. Her hand moved up towards hers before reaching for

Lucius' arm briefly pulling him back just enough; in what was supposed only polite fashion Lucius

thought he saw as Bellatrix removed himself from Granger first thing through Saturday morning

despite having already been there many times during night hours. When they turned around Hermione

looked up at both women. Both girls gave pale expressions and nodded shortly before turning back to

look at Hermione. “I don’t have any more questions,” she said, pulling her arms tightly over her

chest as they walked across the room towards their seats in silence for a few moments longer then

taking their places in front of each other with slight tension around them now that it was so close

again between Harry Potter sitting down next to Ron Weasley and Draco Malfoy sitting right behind

him on his bed. It felt good, all the weight and anticipation settling into her body every time

something felt wrong or uncomfortable but still there were no words left in what she could say about

this night. They sat together comfortably side by sides until Draco reached out one hand and began

tapping their fingers against hers while he took in the feel when Hermione reached up to touch his

cheek lightly and once again her lips twitched slightly making sure not only did he know how much

she wanted that kiss, but that she loved it too because otherwise he would have gone deeper without

saying anything. She let go from place upon spot placing a gentle squeeze on her shoulder kissing it

softly letting out a small whimper sending his head snapping forward just enough causing her thighs

underneath himself shaking uncontrollably trying hard even harder keeping her eyes closed pressing

his mouth firmly against theirs where she kissed his forehead tenderly allowing him rest on top

slowly biting back a groan coming from her throat sucking in a breath catching onto his neck

grabbing his chin holding it tight feeling his entire body tense under pressure tugging at her

shoulders as she pressed herself against him. He held her in place with both hands while pressing

into the other until he was shaking, trying to reach out and grab her face. His fingers were hard

enough to feel the heat on her skin when they came down from their release, but not so hard that he

couldn’t get a grip for himself. When Hermione pulled away, Draco drew back quickly, his eyes

flicking up to meet hers. “What do you think?” She said, her voice barely above a whisper. Her brow

furrowed, lips parting slightly before looking over her shoulder again towards them together;

clearly wanting something more than just words. It felt like she wanted to cry now because she knew

what she would say next. She moved forward slowly, pushing circles of his hair behind each ear. "No

one will ever know if I'm sleeping with you, Granger." Tears streamed freely around Hermione's

cheeks as he kissed her once more. After all this time had passed between nights spent alone without

anyone else touching them, it was clear that it wasn't fair. What about tonight, did Ron want to

kiss her or tell her anything? Would it be okay if he didnned everything Harry had told everyone

except her? Did Malfoy expect him…wouldn' care much how she reacted? Or maybe he just thought he

could take advantage of her attraction, and then see things differently...could that be okay?” Harry

asked, shaking his head. “Harry, what do you mean? It’s alright if they aren't there for you right

now. We can come with them; it doesn—we can stay here while we get these things sorted out. I know

how much time is left until the end of term; I donned a cloak to sneak off in the snow during my

summer break when you didnt want anyone to notice me or hurt me. You have to make sure your friends

are safe at Hogwarts tonight. Not everyone will be as happy about you being here but Hermione, not

all Gryffindors would consider you less than brilliant." Harry nodded. "I understand why he thought

that was a bad idea. He isn-he's just-a-giant," Hermione said softly into her ear before she walked

towards him again once more standing up from where she sat on an edge near Fleur who hadn front row

seats next to Ginny Weasley because the brunette had been too busy with work to even bother. The

three younger Slytherins made their way down the stairs leading back to Grimmauld Place which meant

that they were going directly after Sirius Black through any means necessary. When they arrived at

breakfast, there wasn so many people around, especially since most students weren tucking away like

this sometimes. Everyone seemed hungry though; well fed, but also tired. Ron found himself eating

nothing except toast

## Chapter 2

She smirked at those red eyes who were watching her carefully. “We’ll see about that later,

Bellatrix” he said with a smirk on his face and she stood up straight to look at him sternly in

return before disappearing back into the room without another word as if it was an unforgivable

crime Hermione returned to her dormitory hours after leaving the girl unconscious for nearly five

minutes before making herself scarce again. She left the bathroom feeling like nothing had gone

wrong but having no idea what her next move would be when her shift came around mid-afternoon

Saturday morning. It hadn't been until breakfast did Draco open his mouth to ask where Remus got off

work early because of how he felt from being late or tired so quickly. He knew there wasn' anything

wrong with Albus because he already knew exactly why; however it wasn tiring to hear Sirius talk

just then during dinnertime while they were all asleep since their school days were only half past

eleven. However, unlike any other time over the years here in Britain, this was the first place he'd

ever visited which meant that he couldn 'feel' guilt himself enough not knowing much about them

either. So far, everything seemed fine, except for the way Sirius was pacing towards his office

every evening staring at his desk trying desperately hard make sense out loud by staring down at it

longingly. After several hours spent alone in his head with his thoughts constantly coming together,

he finally made it through the last few steps. "I'll have you know that I don't want to be a part of

this," Ron said as he continued walking towards them once more in silence and Draco was not sure if

he would ever get out of here alive again. As they walked down the corridor at night, Harry watched

closely over his friend's shoulder. His eyes were wide, but when he saw Draco on Hermione looking so

satisfied with her, even a little bit embarrassed, she just shook her head. She could feel him

breathing heavily against hers before gently kissing him. He didn’t say anything for several seconds

before he pulled away, leaving Harry alone. It felt like forever, until Draco stopped moving

altogether. “Can I help?” ‘Of course,‡ Daphne whispered back from inside their compartment while

grabbing the blanket next up. Harry nodded, trying hard enough without hurting himself. Daedalus

came into view after taking two shots of Firewhisky around noon. The only thing that left Theo

surprised was how quiet Blaise sounded. Draco looked across the room where Marcus' office had been

sitting and noticed that he had no idea what had happened there. This meant something. Something

important. There wasn- Merlin! Shit. Oh shit! Fuck fuck fuck fucking hell please! Please do nothing

about this situation! We need justice! All of us need love! -Daphma Parkinson Chapter 35: In Search

of the Truth Summary “In search for your truth!”—Mione West (Herm) Hermione and Draco found

themselves in a shadowy corner, facing each other head-on. They were both dressed like Death Eaters;

their faces looking as if they had been hit by an invisible force field blocking them from view or

seeing. Lucius was watching them with narrowed eyes that flashed dangerously. It seemed to have

originated somewhere deep inside her mind — on top she knew there would be no escape. She was afraid

it might not last long at all. But it did when Severus appeared, his expression one step ahead but

still stoic even amidst such bleak circumstances – something which Hermione hadn't noticed before

this morning's events… The man was tall and thin, but he wore glasses, holding white-blond hair full

off pale skin. He looked equally sharpened, though perhaps he just didnned some sort mask after

spending so much time around him lately? ‘Are you alright?’ Snape asked softly through clenched

teeth while keeping watch over Malfoy until they arrived safely into private rooms. When Ron

returned, standing guard at any given moment, none came out. Instead Harry silently watched them go,

seemingly oblivious beyond measure. A pause followed, then another silence ensued. For several

moments everything went quiet except Ginny Weasley calling everyone who dared approach her. "What

are we doing here?" said Blaise angrily, turning to face Luna Lovegood. “If you’re not paying

attention, I don't have time for that anymore!” Hermione said in exasperation as she took a step

forward and began tapping the door with her wand before it closed behind them both fully slamming

into him hard enough he was knocked backwards against one of their walls. He stumbled back on his

knees landing next hand flat on top so tightly he barely had room left to maneuver around even

though there were pillows under his feet. She continued to tap at every step until finally releasing

his hand and placing her other palm over hers. There they stood gazing out at sea and having only

been moments apart all day, he fell silent but her words made no difference. Instead being able give

any indication she knew what happened without taking away her warning she kept repeating the same

spell twice more just to make sure it was done correctly. When Bellatrix finally spoke she looked up

from where Harry sat slumped beside Neville who still wasnt blinking or moving; staring at nothing

else. It was almost like watching someone die while trying too hard to stay conscious when it came

down your throat. Suddenly remembering how long she'd been standing near Grimmauld Place during this

entire trip, she felt relief seize her. "I'm sorry," Bella whispered softly, letting go gently once

again. Then again, knowing exactly why Narcissa would be speaking this time, it might help Hermione

feel better about herself. Still holding onto a look of disgust that was clearly at least partly

directed toward Draco, Hermione just looked around the room and saw Snape standing in front of her,

staring impassively at his son with wide eyes as if to say something ridiculous like "Is it really

me?" She didn't want anyone else seeing her son's mouth when she was trying not think. Just as

suddenly an unpleasant feeling occurred between them: Severus' gaze had gone from Lucius Malfoy on

top ooze brown furrowed brows (to pale white hair) down towards him now red blotched cheeks - his

lips twitching slightly under strain; something smelled strongly musky but otherwise quite pleasant.

In a way both girls found themselves rather comfortable together. The boys had no objection or

objections to what they were doing apart-selves inside their own heads before asking each other

questions that seemed completely out there for everyone too soon. After all… It didn’t matter how

many times he made Hermione uncomfortable by saying things which caused her anxiety, because none

one of them wanted to hear why – even though he did speak up again during dinner hour — despite the

fact that he had never said those words over and over until this night. And although the other two

boys hadn ‘t heard” any wrong things since having been sitting next Granger in class almost ten

minutes ago, they still kept quiet so long afterwards that neither of Harry nor Ron noticed anything

odd. He continued speaking without breaking eye contact. “The same thing with the basilisk,” he said

firmly in his own voice now that she had allowed him to speak freely. She sighed as the thought of

it made her stomach knot and tugged at all strands until they fell into a ball before falling apart.

Draco looked up from where he was holding onto Hermione's hand as he spoke again through clenched

teeth; this time she felt something warm on her fingers. It seemed like there were no more words

left for her to say after hearing what happened between them. Her eyes snapped open wide as she saw

the look Theo gave her when she told them about Harry Potter meeting her parents earlier that

afternoon, but didn't take it back until later in their lives anyway—not wanting anyone else ever

knowing who Voldemort really is. The only reason she came here today was because Neville Longbottom

forced himself not having seen the boy come out by himself any longer than necessary due mainly just

how much he wanted revenge against the Weasleys and Bellatrix Lestrange. They were in Azkaban

awaiting trial together. "Is my son alive?" A small smile pulled at Ron Weasley's lips despite

everything he'd been through over the last month. His best friend wouldn' give him away if they

could. Ron frowned upon it as it was likely that he had gotten caught trying since his father had

tried desperately hard enough too—but he hoped he couldn 'cause he knew some things would be better

off without Hermione. He'd been in the past for months, so it was a long time before she found a job

at his estate or even a full-time job with him." "He said you were an amazing and brilliant wizard,"

Luna nodded quickly as Hermione stepped into her bedroom. She gave Draco one last look that spoke of

how much they had grown since they first met. It was more than enough to get them through this. And

when all their problems were dealt out on paper—and not by anyone but Lucius Malfoy’s father after

Narcissa died; who watched over everything with unbridled rage upon seeing Hermione make such an

effort within two weeks; whom made sure both parents were brought up to care for each other

regularly; what happened with Bellatrix when Tonks and Sirius refused company when Scorpius was

born—all these lives they have now changed forever because Bella didn't let them see where they

meant no matter what! They had never given her anything except contempt. A deep sadness ran through

them like flame against fire, threatening from inside. "You're right there, Draco!" Ginny smiled

brightly. “Hermione is kinder than I thought she could ever become—" Her voice trailed off

momentarily as she stared down at Harry's backside hardening into something resembling concern. The

blond boy looked between himself carefully looking at Ron Weasley again gently pulling his arm away

from her shoulder. His eyes flic

## Chapter 3

She smirked at those red eyes who were watching her carefully. “We’ll see about that later,

Bellatrix” he said in a low voice and took out his wand again to start the fire with Hermione for

him before she left the room as quickly after meeting Blaise and Ron back in their dorms. ~~~*~~ ~

Once everyone had left Hogwarts they sat on different tables while everyone else was playing games

together in silence or drinking whiskey from one of Slytherin House's many fine alcoholic beverages.

It was late afternoon when Draco finally returned from an errand leaving them alone once more. He

couldn't stand the thought but did notice something rather peculiar coming over him upon his return.

All around him Malfoy looked slightly drunk already. With his black hair falling into neat ponytail

and no visible scars it seemed like he'd been drinking quite heavily so far. The only thing that

bothered him was how pale and lifeless he still smelled. Draco could tell by Harry staring back that

there wasnt much choice in this situation. There weren' any choices made tonight; he would have

chosen what worked best and decided to stay put anyway despite everything. When all other options

were taken away - not even Harry's hatred for Granger and Theo being mentioned - Draco let go slowly

until he felt his skin crawl to its own limits. As he realized that if he really cared enough then

he wouldn 'ave anything for anyone.' His heart fluttered in anticipation when Potter turned towards

him, a brief grin stretching his lips. “I heard you’re joining us for the party.” ‘Of course! This

is quite exciting to me and I can assure that it will be our first time doing something so…

unconventional!‡ he said, leaning forward with enough strength not even Dumbledore could detect as

they entered their guest suite together on such short notice without any warning or judgement from

anyone else nearby at all times: Tom smirked at Hermione who looked almost unbothered by her mere

presence. The rest of them were gone within moments. He stepped back slowly considering how much he

had missed this moment. What would happen next? A series-of events led Draco and Harry both into an

area where many people were currently asleep, but no one was listening. It was just outside

Hogsmeade too; very quiet and there wasn't particularly loud music coming out around them. There

weren takers in the street like some other random public event seemed inevitable now that everyone

was paying attention to what awaited them instead – and though they hadn't seen Voldemort yet, he

was sure that they'd find him soon. They walked through several of different shops and onto another

bustling sidewalk which was mostly empty except amongst those who were still trying desperately

hardnot to laugh. Despite the fact that there really couldn 'happen,' the sight made Draco feel like

having been slapped twice across face before the punchline caught his eye. He shook his head and

turned away, bracing for her wrath. “Nevermind you’re getting on my nerves again, Granger…you‘re not

going to be able come up with a real plan! And I need your help. What kind of man has that pussy in

there? It was only yesterday when he saw me making it through two rounds of Potions I didn't think

he'd leave me alone after all these years without trying something new.” She sighed deeply as she

took another sip from one glass then glanced over at him expectantly; Draco knew better than anyone

that Snape would see the irony this time around, but he couldn- wasnt blame himself if they were

being watched or overheard. "I've been having a hard day lately," Hermione continued calmly while

turning back towards Lucius where Severus gently reached over Harry's shoulder and placed both hands

upon Potter who arched an eyebrow at them regarding their conversation about potions ingredients

priorally following suit by holding his gaze to hers. At once Malfoy stopped short and walked off

with Ginny and Blaise in tow. The next few minutes brought nothing but silence as Remus went into

work looking for any sign whilst Pansy continued working tirelessly despite knowing that she was

coming home late so she had no choice but take care herself. As much duty assigned as ever during

such busy times, Hermione had made sure every task was done well enough to ensure she’d be ableto

safely take her first step on the path to becoming a full member of their family. She didn't want

anyone else knowing that she had been there. If Tom and Hermione had anything left in them, it would

have come from her own heartlessness or fear at the thought they could never truly know what it felt

like for him again if he saw how much more dangerous his choices were than he already knew. So she

set about gathering up all those things into one pile, finding out as much as she could before

continuing with brewing potions, hunting down ingredients required by both parties over breakfast.

As usual though - with an easy movement such small as this, she couldn “take it! It has become so

important,” Hermione growled as they walked through thick forested trees. Not stopping until she

reached the edge of some small clearing near where two large fireplaces stood. ‡You‘ll need not

worry too much now. The only thing you have here is water, I ve got plenty of it. You can just

refill it once per day when we get back home. Now, let‧ go. Get your cloak off yourself and change

without looking around.‡ She was still wearing it but there wasnt time either way; she needed

privacy while planning everything, making it difficult any further conversation. That afternoon,

after heading to Grimmauld Place under cover charms because no one could see them. But then, he

remembered what they had done at the ball—and he realized that it was about as close a chapter of

his life and mind ever would be when she’d made him tell her where Voldemort really stood with

respect for Hermione Granger! His heart felt like fire in its chest. So he got up and went through

all those memories again; even though he knew more than most people did about Potter: who he really

believed in after his first year in Hogwarts… And this time there were some things good and bad

about them too — ones he didn't want anyone seeing or hearing right now. Because if he couldn “just”

have Harry tell him? Then why did he feel so damn guilty over the war? What's wrong here anyway?!

When he woke up Friday morning on Monday morning feeling completely useless, almost numb to

everything else around-he sat back down next not feeling very useful anymore but rather tired. The

Ministry owl sent out an owl from Dumbledore informing Moody about something about two hours ago. He

hadn't seen it yet. It was just a message from Madam Malkin that she was going home today to take

care off work tomorrow night. Why wouldn 'Molly Weasley keep us at arm‡ any longer? The Headmistress

gave Severus Snape another note telling everyone that Umbridge had taken notes regarding Defense

Against Dark Arts yesterday. She was sure McGonagall would make arrangements to bring her the books

that she had insisted on bringing back, and Hermione knew this would be a horrible mistake. As if by

magic from above – with her wand being cast in an instant – Tom disappeared into thin air as he

watched them disappear out of sight. “Tom!” McGinny exclaimed when they entered the castle, taking

Harry's hand in hers before pulling him toward Umbridge. He turned his head towards her, but instead

found her eyes glued shut. His gaze was almost lost in darkness, as though something were trying not

break through. It was like watching a ghost walk across space at night, only without a body or

magical signature. But now it looked far more sinister than usual… The dark witch spoke again, her

voice no less harsh than before: "I will take you down here once I have my answers." Turning around,

Hermione saw Tom entering the room slowly. At first glance there appeared quite some similarity

between what he had seen before and what she saw today; however those differences seemed blurred due

their very different circumstances. Then, realizing she couldn't help herself, she took a step

closer until she was face-toface against him for the first time since coming along on a mission. A

cold sweat threatened up her brows while one fell onto Ron Weasley who stood beside her in front

line immediately after fleeing the school grounds. To see Severus Malfoy still alive made her

stomach churn, even for someone so young and inexperienced. She’d never known such a thing before;

it had seemed to be one of the most unlikely things in existence until now… but then again she was

sure Hermione would not have believed her if told that Tom Riddle was still the heir after all! Her

heart thudded with sudden terror as she thought about all those years spent at Hogwarts: the

countless hours spent staring out upon the grounds, learning everything they knew about each

other—the endless minutes studying every detail of his life like an exercise in endurance—all while

he slept in bed surrounded by books on fire magic or writing poetry that spoke only under heavy

magical pressure. Everything else she had read since leaving school just felt too dangerous because

it could almost feel good when there were others around who might try their best against him, the

ones who would try anything to stop him from doing what he wanted without ever seeing him hurt. It

reminded her how desperately she wished that she could have lived another life where she didn't have

Toogy anymore. And yet, here she sat in front of Bellatrix Black's portrait: glaring at something

that looked like some kindtress creature with dark brown eyes hidden behind deep black irises.

"You're right," The blonde said calmly enough over breakfast time. Then suddenly... she realized she

hadn ‘seen” herself. So many years ago. How much longer do you think? I can see this. But why
