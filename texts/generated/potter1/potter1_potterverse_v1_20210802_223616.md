'“Oh, fuck this,” Bellatrix says. “Here’s how it is, pet. You can either'

## Chapter 1

“Oh, fuck this,” Bellatrix says. “Here’s how it is, pet. You can either hold my hand and give me a

firm grip or I will snap your knuckles in two and you won't even need to try anything else, just

concentrate on what you are doing so we both know exactly where you want us with the spell going

down. Grab that wand out of Hermione's robes and get ready for me!‡ Bella growls and she starts

pulling away from her witch as soon they stand like that, pushing herself off the ground at Ron

being so close. As Harry and Hermione walk together towards their destination, Narcissa leans over

Draco and kisses him passionately. When he places a kiss on hers, they both say goodbye once more

before leaving. Chapter 26: The Witch Within Summary – Part One - November 19th 2013 After several

days spent alone Hermione wakes up early after waking up drunk again having been drinking heavily

since last night. Knowing now would be the perfect time to change into jeans instead of shirt while

looking forward every single day about everything went wrong between them because of Potter calling

Dumbledore an arsehole who didn 'have a plan'. Being told by Snape not only was there nothing but a

massive black eye left behind which made Severus look far too concerned if ever there were anyone

amongst the Order other than Albus standing right next to him telling Voldemort his godson wouldn'

die instantly knowing full well when those eyes belonged around Sirius Black. Harry didn’t like to

think about it, but he was feeling a little uneasy at the thought of what that may mean. He had no

idea how much time they were likely to spend together in Azkaban, and if things would really be

different for them… “Now, where have you been?” Ron asked, looking up from his coffee cup. ‘I

haven't seen anything on the other side since I left Hogwarts!‪ Hermione said with a wide smile as

she got herself up into her seat. She turned to face him, not wanting anyone else seeing her look at

her through something as unkempt or dangerous as he  did here so soon after. The way he looked at

his friends now reminded Harry just how good she felt – an amazing part wrapped tightly around his

heart and soul mate bond. Her expression softened slightly before shifting back down to hers. They

watched silently as Madam Pomfrey walked over first getting her robe off. When everyone was finished

washing their hands and then dressing themselves all dressed quickly, Madame Bones approached the

two witches who sat next between Snape's desk facing away towards Draco Malfoy sitting in front-row

across from Voldemort himself staring calmly at both men s faces. As he continued speaking with his

voice low, the others began making their own motions. Once everyone had made sure everything went

according plan once more there appeared out loud in silence as the Headmaster made his way over to

them, and began casting spells that Hermione could not read. Harry took a deep breath before he

spoke again: "We need more than just students coming into our dorms today…I will do everything I can

to keep you safe." "As promised," Theo said firmly, standing up from his seat across from him with a

supportive expression on both of their faces – it was clear they were enjoying themselves. "If you

didn't know what he was doing, please don’t make yourself uncomfortable now." Voldemort watched his

son with the tightness inside himself; it seemed he felt like he would grow old fast if he wasn “get

along” with his family. His words did little for either side, but given the circumstances, they

certainly had no choice but look forward when they had the chance tonight, or tomorrow. Notes:- A/N

- There was one other thing about this story though...something which probably isn-not totally

necessary. If you'd rather skip it (or feel free), I hope you enjoyed it. Chapter 38 Notes* Next

week is going back after two chapters! Stay tuned :) Now, let's get some good news first so we all

have something planned ;) Tomorrow has been full of exciting things …and maybe even foreplay at its

finest. It looks like Draco is pregnant too, because she told her Papa yesterday morning 'they are

very close'. Enjoying my time here folks. Chapter 4: Andante Notes: Hello again, everybody! I hope

you all enjoy this update (I'm sorry it's not updating until after Easter but if I do have to change

something in a long time the next chapter will be there so we can continue as normal and hopefully

no one is going crazy with what they're reading :) Sorry for the delay on updates...but please feel

free ;) Now onto the last two chapters - The Locket of Gryffindor Chapter Text “So, how about

Hermione?” Narcissa asked quietly. ‘What does she have? A Horcrux? Or am I missing something

important?  Why did her name appear in these notes or just me? What would she say? We know that some

things only happen when someone has access by being spoken to at certain times. That makes us even

more curious than ever before because now our world seems completely different from where it was

yesterday. When faced alone like tonight with Tom Riddle looking as though he could hurt nothing

new, without knowing who his Father really belonged…what kind were those possibilities? Did Nagini

have a Hor Crucio curse...? If yes, then why didn't Voldemort want them hidden inside anything other

than his soul? At least none should be found within Azkaban yet anyway…. "Hermione, stay away from

people," Narcissus said calmly, but somehow kept herself out anyways. She sat down across from Ron,

watching him with a frown on his face as he took another sip of tea in order to drink a bit more

slowly. Hermione was so caught up being surrounded by the people who cared about her that she didn't

notice Tom making a comment or even look at them; instead it just filled her head like an endless

stream and she couldn’t help noticing how many things they had made up around her since their

wedding day. There were several people here, most especially Malfoy Manor guards, that looked

exactly what they did to each other when they were alone. He looked utterly relaxed and composed

while keeping his expression neutral. His eyes met hers for a brief moment before looking away again

which caused a small amount pain to sting her throat causing everyone within earshot not only

concern over her physical condition (she was currently bleeding profusely), anxiety regarding how

the potion would affect her but also the fact that all of the wizards in this room hadn't been

drinking enough. “So… you are staying?” Harry asked, his voice low as if he were struggling against

something heavy inside himself due to stress as well! It seemed a little difficult to say clearly

because neither Draco nor anyone else answered correctly either. The man nodded eagerly once giving

him one last wink towards heading upstairs followed quickly by Luna walking into bed next door.

~~~*~~~~ Once Voldemort returned to Hogwarts he was sure he would be able convince some of the other

Slytherins to join his cause. As it stood, their main goal had been clear…for now, at least. They

had tried very hard not only in order that they might have an opportunity after all, but also

because if they failed there could still come a day when Harry and Hermione were forced together, or

even worse, hurt. It was likely that as Voldemort's forces got closer, and Dumbledore became more

confident with how good he felt, there would become less of a need for him having so much power over

them. That said however….he hadn’t done anything yet. He wasn't really going back to being

Headmaster either; Snape had already seen through everything else he wanted from Albus before the

last time he had left Hogwarts. After years on the run, he knew she wouldn “go anywhere without me

knowing”. A small part gave him hope that he could finally move past what had started out like

nothing but torture and pain. However—if Alastor Moody didn? Then maybe things couldn- Could they

ever go any further than this? The final battle where they lost meant more than just Ron…but Draco

wondered why McGonagall did what she did most people want her too! When he asked Granger about

whether or never she would leave school again, the girl shook her head. She shrugged and began

explaining her plan. "If we do it one more time then I suppose we could use that to our advantage

and get back in position." "I see," she said. She had no doubt she would be able, but she was very

sure he didn't understand her feelings for the woman. But perhaps he understood them? Maybe they

were simply tools of his manipulation? "Yes?" He sighed into Hermione's ear as if worried about what

she might say next; maybe he still cared enough not only for this witch’s well being now—but even

more importantly… just like she did with him when she spoke at last: that he knew too much. "We can

talk about this later," Lucius muttered before turning to leave. Hermione watched Ron make a final

decision about whether or how best-case scenarios involving Draco Malfoy may play out. He might try

something new, so long without any real risk from either side getting caught by those who tried

anything rash again. Chapter 4: Dissecting the Dividers Summary This is my attempt towards an all

written nonfiction chapter where everything is POV/sequel based on various characters. There are

many changes here which take place after the events happening between Harry Potter & Sirius Black

(which happens to also happen early) Snape doesn have a choice in the matter! In fact, there are

other things Voldemort cannot change yet because he is essentially trapped inside the Dollmaker

manor since Dumbledore has been dead forever! Things will never end however... *cough* SCORE

## Chapter 2

“Oh, fuck this,” Bellatrix says. “Here’s how it is, pet. You can either lay down on the bed, or you

can just bend over and give me a nice hard cock in your mouth right now so that I can suck on yours

for hours to come tonight after all of us have had sex for days. So don't be shy about getting up

here; we won- oh my god! Please do it faster with my hand…oh no, wait what? The hand between them is

not moving anymore, but rather a little longer. Oh yes, please fasten your legs around my thighs

like you are doing before I finish filling you then push yourself back onto one knee once more and

repeat till your full height. Now bring those hands along behind you and press two fingers inside of

you until they hit the spot where Hermione almost exploded her pussy into bloody cunny. Fuck fuck

fuck! Don tuck these clothes away from each other while I ride off Snape again next time. Notes: Hey

everyone! This chapter is still going strong because there has been some drama surrounding the end

credits as well as the epilogue...thank you guys who continue reading....and remember to follow me

at twitter :) Chapter 46: Crescendo Summary | Comments: (See the bottom notes) Chapter Text October

tick tock It was early morning when Hermione woke up. She hadnt felt any of Narcissa's magic since

she'd seen Tom in the dungeons, and they were always more than happy to let her see him interact

with them. It was a relief when he smiled at her as though it were the first time ever that they had

been together after their sixth year (though there had never really seemed like anything else), but

now that his lip-licking became less frequent, it felt like his mouth stretched into an apologetic

line over everything. "I think you should be back." She said simply enough for both boys' eyes

automatically locking on hers; Hermione didn't say anything or make eye contact while speaking those

words, which surprised them both. Draco looked uncomfortable, the same way he had before Christmas,

but by then all three men were fully engaged once again—and this time, even though the small amount

remained hidden from view, Ron's smile wasn’t malicious nor cruel. “Hermione? What are we going do

today?" Lucius asked after several moments silence passed between Harry Potter sitting at Malfoy

Manor table reading books and watching Harry talk about whatever he wanted Voldemort related

directly through Snape following up on his statement regarding Dumbledore being the cause behind his

death. After almost half an hour alone without seeing each other around anyone except their parents

rather heavily scrutinizing their actions, Harry was finally able tell himself not wanting any more

reminders if he kept talking anyway. He turned to leave immediately, his stomach twisting painfully

duelling pants underfoot still firmly rooted deep within his throat. “I can’t even keep a hold on

myself,” he whispered after a moment of hesitation and then looked back up at her with contemptuous

eyes that she could see through him as if they were in pain from the force inside them all night

long. ‘You have no idea what I re talking about!  She laughed at those thoughts before turning

around and taking a step closer to him while their arms shook against each other. He continued along

until finally she stopped walking towards them and began pulling herself together again. She rested

her head against one shoulder and squeezed it tight enough for Ron's fingers not touch her hair.

Draco felt something warm against his neck and watched as Harry's voice came out: "Hermione Granger,

you are my girlfriend. And I know exactly how much this means." Hermione didn't answer but instead

stared up into Malfoy eye-level. His cheeks flushed pink. For some reason despite himself being so

close, he found comfort just beyond the obvious discomfort. It was intoxicating. The thought brought

forth a wave down his spine and made him harden completely. But most importantly - and perhaps more

importantly than anything else – it felt like it had been replaced by pleasure. Like he could go on

forever without really needing to stop. This had nothing going between any two boys. Not now anyway;

he would get used quickly, because he knew right now he couldn' wait to give in and take his

revenge. He didn't want anyone else seeing him like this, especially not with the redhead still

sprawled across Hermione's lap. "I'll tell you when I'm done," Bellatrix said quietly as she went to

grab her wand back from Snape who was staring at them both curiously for a moment before turning to

leave. Once she had gone, Ron looked up and whispered something under their breath that caused all

of Harry’s attention away so they were both walking towards each other instead without looking down

or exchanging looks. They headed out onto empty corridors after taking a shower though as they

walked through halls it was easy enough just knowing where the bathroom would be until they reached

Malfoy Manor. When they got there, Draco seemed genuinely surprised by what the Slytherin girl was

doing. “Where are we going?” Neville asked while glaring at Draco. Draco turned around and looked

around then motioned for Hermione into silence. She stared at him for several seconds before shaking

her head. If Harry was honest, he felt like he could have been trying anything on his own but he

wanted nothing more than continue being polite with Hermione. It was hard keeping silent if she

really wasn- After putting off dinner, and going over some ideas about how things might go tomorrow

night... Draco nodded and sat down next Toogy. Sitting down beside Ingeus, Ginny and Marcus followed

suit, neither having any idea what was going on. Draco’s hands moved from his sides to the side of

Hermione and he felt her head start down to brush against him again as she began rubbing it back and

forth between them in a slow circle until he could barely feel anything at all. She looked up at

Harry with something like concern and confusion and then stared back at Ron who let out a small

growl that he couldn't quite place but rather gave in for when he realised that she had been

watching him closely. The moment he saw his own expression change once more he knew why. He turned

to face her and smirked as he slid two fingers into hers. “I think I might be able have a word with

you about how to deal," he said slowly. "You are my favorite Gryffindor." She bit her lip and

swallowed hard. If he hadnt known she would be kissing him so eagerly this morning, he would never

have dared do such an thing. But there were moments where the thought made sense. When she kissed

harder than she usually did, or tried to, Draco would have laughed because Hermione hadn- She

didn?d?t know if she wanted one of those things anymore… Instead now they both seemed completely

serious. Her eyes fluttered shut and she pulled away before he even realized what he'd done— but

after just half an hour without kissing, it was too late. They were both hurt; neither wanted

revenge. Their skin was red, but they didn’t really care that it was hurting. Draco couldn't tell if

she had done something to him or not because of his injuries and the fact he could still feel them

as well from where he stood in front her room door staring at a book. “I know you are worried about

me now—but I want all your help as soon we can, so if anyone needs help, just say anything,”

Hermione said softly when she opened what looked like an open door on one side looking out of sight.

She stepped forward and leaned into Harry who reached for Ron gently holding onto him tightly. He

squeezed his eyes shut again before pulling back slightly towards Narcissa saying slowly: "This is

different. You aren- this isn. We are trying hard to find some answers." ‘We are here to talk...‡

Ron said quietly speaking to himself internally wondering why Bellatrix would even be involved with

him anymore than Bella did - how do you expect someone else to take away everything? Suddenly

feeling completely exposed, Harry tried breathing through clenched teeth, trying desperately try

talking to his godfather without breaking eye contact. But then Ron abruptly pulled up next asking:

What happened to your parents? Why donned your father's robes while pretending no one cared enough?!

No, seriously, let us go look over there! Just ask Voldemort…. It was beyond unbelievable how much

pain these people felt inside their bones. It made it impossible for her to breathe normally, she

was certain that the pain would end up affecting her lungs and the muscles around them as well - so

she took a momentary breath to get herself upright and let out a small sigh. She wasn't sure what to

think about either of those things. There were certainly times when Hermione could feel pain in her

own body and she knew why; but then again...it felt too good not just to hold onto her emotions any

longer. With the Death Eaters still at large - there had been some time ago when they had managed

defeat Voldemort's forces without even taking part into battle - she suspected there may have come a

time where something would have happened. Now however? Maybe once more they would be able put

themselves back together. "Do you know who I am?" Lucius asked, not speaking on his behalf over

dinner. He rose from one chair and pulled himself away from Draco. Snape looked down at him,

glancing at Malfoy with concern before he continued: "…you're still young, Severus." A tense silence

fell between both men until after their conversation Lucius sighed heavily in relief – he didn’t

want this evening disturbed by anything but war and destruction. The fact remained that Voldemort

hadn taunted Granger enough or pressured her into being involved somehow, despite knowing exactly

what she would do if she tried … "Would you rather me keep your hand forever?" Ron said gruffly

## Chapter 3

“Oh, fuck this,” Bellatrix says. “Here’s how it is, pet. You can either come right now, or we can

get you out of here in two hours. If I have to pull up my pants and walk over there, let me hold

your cock for now. No one will be able to see what is going on because I won't be moving any faster

than a horse. Don take these off until I tell them that they are not allowed outside the tent so

they don' bother trying anything else. But once they do find me again…‡ she starts but Bellats name

breaks from her mouth as soon As they leave the room Hermione is standing next to Hermione who has

moved closer to her when Hermione grabs her arms tightly and kisses her head softly. As though

someone were to pick her at random Once more Hermione reaches down to touch Bellati's cheek. The

only time anyone touches her after kissing her is if she is looking through the mirror too close to

find her husband, which happens twice each day It takes every minute or second before Bellatti wakes

up She looks around nervously When she opens her eyes Hermione finds her bedpost and a pair boxers

littering the floor together with her bag. After cleaning herself up Hermione walks into an empty

bathroom and turns to look at Bella while taking her bath. A few minutes later everything becomes

clear Hermione stands staring blankly at nothing where she sees Narcissa waiting for her, the water

cooler in their room. “You’re awake?” she asks surprised, and Hermione nods. She looks around again

before turning to Bellatrix with a surprised look on her face as if she has seen this exact moment,

but it still surprises her that when she goes back there is no one else inside of Bellatsia's room,

instead all eyes are focused upon her. The girl seems worried about being alone anymore, even though

they have been together many times already at least once or twice now, so getting up from bed right

away feels like the best way to go without having to hide herself behind them. As soon as Hermione

starts to move into sleep she hears footsteps approaching towards her sister; "NO." Bellin says,

moving closer to her daughter who is lying next to the stairs looking terrified. "Oh my god!"

Hermione yells trying not to think too much through how shocked she sounds. Suddenly everything

stops, Harry Potter walks over and takes his leave of the room where he is hugging his little

brother while Hermione watches every step by. For almost an hour Bella sleeps peacefully until after

breakfast hours comes along and then just outside of bed Remus wakes feeling tired out of his chest

because people were staring at him completely confused. A couple minutes later Sirius walks past

himself wondering why everyone would be here laughing rather than seeing red faced teenagers crying

hysterically underneath their beds. After lunch dinner finally arrives ready for class time which

only makes things more interesting. It’s the first day of term and Hermione is sitting at her desk,

waiting for a plate of biscuits to arrive from the kitchen table. “What about that French toastie?”

she asks as the girl who is eating rolls opens it carefully looking over everything before turning

back around and leaving a few empty plates on the table across from him in front them with two sets

platters of crisps and a bowlful oatmeal. He takes one of his own and starts handing the boy

something to eat immediately. The girl nods and Draco almost falls out of bed when he sees that she

has opened the bottle of coffee slightly faster than normal and there are two plates already placed

across the room where they are all served together. As soonas Draco hears that his eyes widen open

slightly so that he is staring at both girls and watches Professor Snape order the food off of each

other and then turn to look at himself. On Friday night Hermione sits in breakfast watching the boys

go through homework while doing her best not show any reaction towards Draco or anyone else nearby

but instead just stares at herself suspiciously until she finds herself standing alone after taking

several deep breaths trying hard enough because if anything happens to her next steps could cause

her even worse damage. So right away she knows that this isn't going anywhere and decides against

it. She stands up slowly walking into an office and begins speaking quickly figuring that whatever

happened yesterday might have been more than just a prank, he is now convinced by her words and the

fact she did something to him. "Did she hurt you?" Hermione asks as they break apart leaving Draco

alone in his thoughts for an hour or so. Even though it has taken Remus many days to look at both of

them properly after spending all this time with Harry Sirius feels like every single day would be

harder without their relationship continuing. May 21 st 1992 It has only two hours until breakfast

when Neville bursts into the common room where Daphne isn't looking forward too much but instead

sits down next Toogy who honestly hasn’t said anything since coming here early one morning while

Minerva is sitting on the couch reading books about potions. “Hey! I missed lunch today because my

father was doing some stuff; which explains why we spent most our time together last night. But if

you haven think what I am going over there take your mind off of everything else then come along let

me know how busy school is." The boy says before heading up to the Common Room where Paddy leads

everyone back inside having no idea whether Ron is home yet either, neither being able make sure

from anyone asking any questions during breakfast even knowing enough about Albus to ask someone's

name had become extremely difficult due not wanting to get caught listening to another person

talking amongst themselves causing Poppy however wishes that didn?s eyes narrowing slightly frowning

deeply trying hard not taking himself out of her mind. "I am sorry," she said, she had a very nice

looking arm around him and he was completely innocent. He nodded with a small smile making sure that

his eyes were closed when she turned to leave. The next day after dinner, the boys went back to

their dorms and spent some time in one another's rooms doing homework for the week before getting up

on Monday morning to get ready for bed again. Ron started going over Harry’ses story about why they

always kept talking so fast; however it wasn't until Draco mentioned that he knew what happened

during a fight between Harry Potter/Hermione McGonagall which left them both wondering if there were

any way either side could ever forgive themselves from this mess without breaking apart like last

year. “The battle?” asked Hermione, sitting down across from Harry as she walked towards him. She

looked away from the headmaster and slowly began speaking to herself how horrible things felt at the

beginning, but then quickly added that whatever caused it would never end well enough or even worse

than something terrible happening here. When she finally stopped, tears stinging her cheeks all

night, Hermione realized that perhaps maybe today wouldn- ‘It is my fault I'm being punished!‏

exclaimed Harry angrily. Hermione smiled weakly turning her attention to face the Headmistress once

more. It was clear that she didnt want anyone else to know anything about this; though, for a moment

she thought she would have to try. It was difficult when she had seen the scar on Hermione’s face

and wondered if it meant something. The pain was mutual between them but they were so different now

that Harry just felt nothing. He could feel her tears against his chest as he fought against him

even as Ron tore at Draco's shirt again trying desperately not growl in frustration. When Hermione

finished crying, she let out a sob and pulled away from Tom with one hand. She closed her eyes and

started up slowly. “Mione…I don't remember you telling me what happened tonight, or how I can handle

it. There are things I need time alone with before I go back. You didn say goodbye?” Her voice was

very low, her cheeks slightly flushed. His heart stopped beating automatically over her. How do I

tell someone who doesn...you're my friend? Why is it only ever mine then? Every day there seems more

and more hatred towards us because of our age differences, including ours. If we all made ourselves

into better friends by loving each other while hating others like yourself, maybe tomorrow will be

another chance no matter which way those two choose their own path. What does it mean? Do people

change anymore without feeling hated around themselves? No! Not everyone feels horrible sometimes –

always during romantic duels - except Narcissa, probably. But Voldemort knows differently than most

teenagers did, and he's not exactly on the side of caution with his actions." "But why would you

tell me what happened?" She was so upset she didn't even notice Malfoy's presence in her room. He

had just left her office by then; he'd made sure to leave before leaving for work anyway," Luna was

quiet through a haze as though that were all there actually been. Hermione could see Draco's hand

still there, but it wasn’t lingering or shaking like normal anymore—not at least since the last time

they spoke alone: the night of their first kiss. At this point however... "I donna know how long it

took him when I broke up my relationship because we were dating? Or if I hadnnt felt anything for

three months after he decided against going to school. We didn have any money until about November

1993..." Her heart skipped a beat briefly, almost painfully nervous. Harry and Ron both stood tall

and crossed their arms over them tightly. They looked relieved. It was good feeling to be safe,

especially considering it was Monday morning. Draco and Granger exchanged smiles and watched each

other for a while. "It doesn 'ave been two years since our first romantic relationship ended without

killing someone," said Ginny Weasley softly during one conversation with another boy from Hogwarts

who apparently lived in Hogsmeade. The boys' eyes widened slightly too much to keep from staring at

either girl. In fact.." And then Potter
