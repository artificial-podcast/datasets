'They gave up on the idea when they realized why Dumbledore couldn’t have him dead'

## Chapter 1

They gave up on the idea when they realized why Dumbledore couldn’t have him dead. It wasn't even a

dream, and it was possible that he had killed Harry because of what Voldemort did to him in return

for his prophecy…but there was no way Draco could have been killed as well." "But your father would

never betray you," Hermione said darkly at this; there were things she didnned under her robes but

understood better than anyone else. "No doubt my mother would have done something to protect him

from it if it weren' just me." Her eyes darted around the room; she noticed Ron watching her with

interest while looking between them; as though it were some kind coincidence that they were staring

at each other. She felt her heart sink into its chest every time she thought about something, trying

not think about the fact Malfoy had died so quickly after everything he'd done. They were both lying

quietly by their side, whispering in one another's ear. Their eyes met for a long moment before

turning back to look at Luna who appeared frozen. “I don- I mean we don—” There must be more than

one reason Ginny didn? Even Narcissa hadns bothered asking Granger out here or elsewhere like she

usually did now. The truth was she was too busy trying make sense where everyone else stood behind

herself. Still nothing happened. There still wouldn tarry on and then someone finally broke through

enough walls to try again. If this plan worked then it would solve the problem, and he was relieved

now that he had gotten what he wanted in exchange for his help as well; but still… Hermione sighed

against her chest again with a small sigh, knowing she wouldn’t be able too soon. It was time to go

find her friends. Harry and Ron were waiting at Grimmauld Place when they heard footsteps

approaching them from behind, followed closely by McGonagall who moved towards their trio, looking

nervously at Hermione and giving an impish grin before turning around. “Well, we could take a

shortcut if you wish. We can do so much better than that.” ‘No! No!  The three students rushed

forward slowly and quickly, only to see a familiar face emerging onto either side of Professor

Beery. She had taken the liberty not thinking about how she felt going back to Hogwarts or anything

else. But after hearing everything that Professor Dumbledore had said, she knew something needed

taking place somewhere along these lines. Notes: I really love all your comments on my Tumblr where

#3) Summary: "I don't think anyone knows exactly why Pansy Parkinson is here!" * ~ TBC ≠ AN1: For

those of you new readers wondering which chapter did/didnadily-never-ve-been there yet... Anyway...

Sorry!! Well no one is going to have a proper dinner here, but I guess we can go and sit with

Draco.” Neville grinned at his friend and then made his way down the hall towards Hermione's study

where he found Harry kneeling in front of her. “Are you sure? You know how much she loves to play

around with you so it’s hard for him not noticing that you‘re probably not touching yourself like

that anymore. Are either your hands up or down my cock?  Harry asked softly. He was looking over at

Hermione who gave him an amused look as she did this every time. Harry chuckled at her question and

motioned toward the table next to them both while taking off his jeans before turning back inside of

himself. It was rather chilly out when they were alone together though; cold air flicked through the

wood floorboards on which Malfoy stood standing behind the couch. The moment he felt something tug

at the back door, all three wizards disappeared from sight. Neville went to stand beside Hermione

and began rubbing himself against hers thoroughly. Once again nothing had happened between them

during their last night together. When Harry finally got into position, Ron was already waiting by

Ginny Weasley‡s side. Ginny moved closer than usual and looked down at herself. She had noticed the

redhead‾s nakedness since returning from work earlier today. Ron just stared at what she wore under

robes and shook his head slightly. Hermione had been told to keep quiet, but she didn't care

anymore. She was sure Draco would eventually tell her the truth—but what about the others? “I’ll be

back soon for you all in a few hours, Malfoy-witch! I promise I will look after my friends while

they are in school, so I can see them better as they go on their own little adventure. Now get out

of here before it gets too dark. I think we need more than just tea and biscuits this time around.”

Malfoy glared at him over McGonagall's shoulder once again then back down to where he stood with

Crookshanks snorting. ‘Well I don`t know how long longer I have until you two sleep together at

night?�raised Draco from behind Ron Weasley as Crooks huffed angrily into Bellatrix Black who

groaned loudly; ‡you should not worry me right now please..† Draco whined bitterly when Crooked

looked up at her with one eyebrow raised. He rolled his eyes and began running towards the door,

Hermione grabbed his arm tightly and disapparated quickly without another word or glance. Chapter

Harry Potter & The Order!!! You'll find plenty of other fun stuff going forward - check it OUT!!

(See the end notes next week if there are any missing parts.) Chapter Text 24—Lullaby “Come for me,

love.” Draco pulled her closer and pressed his lips to hers before kissing down so she was on top of

him without complaint or even pleasure at all; he didn't know how long it would take to come, but

eventually he felt himself sinking into a rhythm with each inhale that trickled from between them as

they straddled one another like two rubber bands sticking together in an orgasmic web. When their

tongues touched again just once more after a few minutes had passed Hermione arched her back and

sighed out softly, not wanting Lucius's approval of what Snape said about being possessive toward

her. It was when Severus finally spoke up in warning comment on something involving Harry Potter

saying things that made Malfoy pout in exasperation rather than lustful disgust over Lily Evans'

death--that caused Granger huffing out loud in horror. "What did you say?" Ron asked quietly. He had

just returned home from work when Moody stood watching curiously while looking around. As soon

Narcissa appeared outside Hogwarts grounds holding James Sirius Black by Bellatrix Lestrange  and

having gotten ready quickly enough Harry hurriedly stepped inside the castle and looked around

nervously, wondering where Moody could be. When Voldemort left them behind, everyone turned their

attention back to Kingsley Shacklebolt who still wasnt present, only appearing when Dumbledore had

told both the Dark Lord and his followers to stay put. The two of them walked into Hogsmeade with

Hagrid out for some water, before returning to Malfoy Manor where they were greeted by Professor

Sprout who was politely patting Hermione on her back as she stood up. "What's going on?" he asked,

turning around slowly so that his hands were touching her hair. He ran his eyes down her face in

confusion. She looked at him, but made no move towards Harry or Ron. Instead it became clear how

much she wanted nothing more than a simple explanation about what was happening. What did Snape

really know? It seemed Draco didn't want anything to do wrong; he just felt like there would be

plenty involved if things went well for both sides… But while Draco was still very confused, he knew

something wasn’t right. Granger was being treated worse this year than ever since the war began

because even though her family had been fighting against Voldemort, she hadn—she had fought

alongside him all these years. Her parents had died trying not to show their support for students

from the magical community. They had given way to hatred and prejudice over time. And now, after

everything that happened between herself during sixth-year and her parents during seventh past

Sunday night...they believed that she was lying. That she couldn “be trusted!  Not like everyone

else does”…. ‘Hermione is lying  the Headmaster said that Hermione was. She’s not sure what she

believes or thinks, but if this makes her feel better then I think she should let me know ‘Hermia…I

don't believe you and Ron have a choice in anything, they are just living their lives together so it

doesn-” Draco trailed off as he looked down at his daughter with concern on his face while Harry

shook his head. The Headmistress felt herself start to lose interest and turn away from him. “Yes,

of course. They do have choices, we can help them find one for themselves. Just remember that any

decisions people make about us affect others all the same, regardless how well our feelings will be

affected by being here. We aren—we don;t deserve to live like this! If we decide to take revenge

against someone else now instead than before, there is nothing right under our noses except

retaliation - especially when those other people were my best friends again. And honestly, who would

want to go through all these hoops? Not even yourself, Bellatrix. You look dead tired today,

Malfoy." ‡What did you say? Do you really think your little bitch is going anywhere?† He smirked

slightly at her and turned back around to walk out of Hogwarts. Hermione walked into an empty

classroom staring up at Professor McGonagall. "Yes?" asked Snape looking at Dumbledore in surprise.

It took longer than she

## Chapter 2

They gave up on the idea when they realized why Dumbledore couldn’t have him dead, not even for a

week. I don't know if it was because he didn—he just had to keep his identity hidden from everyone

else and let Voldemort take care of himself. Harry and Ron both thought that wasnd be enough. They

never bothered with hiding their feelings; no one did. It seemed like too much risk. The more people

knew about Severus Snape's past...the harder this all became… “Harry! I can” Hermione exclaimed as

she saw a flashbulb floating above them in front her bedside table where Sirius lay curled into

Fleur‘s chest with another sleeping girl next by the door-post who looked absolutely immolated over

her shoulder and eyes closed tightly. She could see a large patchwork head standing out against

white curtains framed behind black velvet sheets; there were also pictures sitting around her

bedroom window overlooking an open balcony view of Hogwarts; paintings were everywhere; it made

sense that one day someone would look into the whole place and come across something so priceless.

Even though she felt slightly guilty for letting herself think of Snape at times...she finally

remembered what she truly felt: losing control under such circumstances, and then feeling helpless

again. ‡How many times has your life been taken? How many innocent lives are lost due solely upon

you being responsible or loving those you love?  ~~~*~~~~ At 12:22 am the house elves brought home a

package of sweets. They were small enough that only two people could see them, but they looked

delicious as well and Hermione had been itching to eat for all week. She thought that it was time

she got her chocolate and marshmallows back from their table. The house elf handed over the gifts to

Draco while he put them in his pocket before handing one up with him on what must have actually be

an enormous silver box. “It’s perfect, I promise you!” He said proudly. Hermione couldn't help

herself. Her fingers started trembling slightly at how much she wished she was here. In front there

wasnned several boxes full upon each other like nothing she'd ever seen before; a picture frame of

Harry Potter, Voldemort watching over Theo when Dumbledore died, Snape looking through books after

he was attacked by Death Eaters in Hogwarts... Draco had also opened some presents specifically for

Ginny. Even though they were different things, Hermione knew what it would mean to get something so

special done right now. With everything that happened between them and every day, it felt like a lot

more than just a gift. It was really nice and surreal to make this kinda thing happen. "Harry!" A

small voice called out from behind the curtain hanging from where Pansy sat in silence as soon As

everyone else left the room. Draco saw Ron leave the place too, followed closely by Neville who went

straight to Daphne. Dora walked over and sat with Neville, both of them looking up at her in shock

as she saw the two of their friends holding hands. "Dora, you look incredible." Harry said honestly

while walking towards her, wanting him not show his face so he didn't think that was a good sign for

either one but just then, Bellatrix Black rose from the floorboards around Hermione's dormitory.

Hermione felt her heart sink into her chest when she looked at the girl standing beside her. She had

never seen anything like this before, how could she expect it would be someone else? They stood

there for only about half an hour until Dolly arrived back out front carrying what looked like small

vials full onto top boxes of potions, which were filled every time. In all honesty though...it

seemed that everyone wanted Bellatsy to take down some kind old wizard or witch they knew! And now

here she is being held captive again?! Chapter 7: So It Has Been A Long Time.... Summary: Prompt: “I

wish I wasn’t torturing you till your last breath.” — Pairing Notes : Hey guys!! Here's my chapter

(not sure if i can post chapters on random sites) because people are always making comments lol -

sorry :) Thank you SO much!!! xX =(See the end notes after each line where the ending has been

added.) Chapter Text Ron decided his life was going to be ruined if he didn’t get Hermione out of

the house. “I don't know how she can go back and fix her parents, I think it will take longer than

this week or two if she is okay with it then that could be a problem, but whatever happens…we are

leaving together now, you should see them both in the hospital wing on Monday morning before they

all leave for Egypt so we won- at least have time to deal w/with some kind of attack tomorrow night.

It could come up either way from there!” Harry said, shrugging lightly as he walked across Malfoy

Manor grounds. He wanted nothing more serious right now than what had just happened between Draco

Weasley —who hadnatived the boy into Slytherin House by force—and Ginny Potter. In fact, Harry

thought loudly as Draco made an effort not merely stand awkwardly staring down his father's grave

after the death scene involving Fred only minutes ago when Ron came running over to the man who led

him to Neville Longbottom. The whole exchange was tense though, and Harry couldn' t stop himself

from breaking eye contact with his godfather while watching the tense interaction between their

families play out. "We need better wards around our family," Lucius told Sirius soon enough as they

left the Great Hall, even though he knew everything was fine. Sirius looked amused once again,

though Harry felt like he had forgotten about what happened. He was still sore and at the same time

he didn’t know if it would be as bad to leave now that Ron seemed as though his ribs were bothering

him. “So, where do you think we could go?” Ron asked. Harry nodded, trying not to make his voice

sound too loud again. They went down the stairs towards Hogsmeade so that they could talk in a

private room before leaving Hogwarts grounds. Hermione said goodbye briefly to Ginny and Tonks but

when she got back onto her feet, the two witches all stared at each other with wide,

uncharacteristic eyes looking for something. She knew there must have been some sort of secret group

meeting somewhere around the castle; anyone who found out how many Death Eaters it contained or even

just those from Hangleton should immediately become suspicious. What made them look more suspicious

was that Draco hadn't told them anything because he wasn- ‘we don' want any of us noticing! We won

see Malfoy here anyway, right?!  Ron yelled angrily after seeing Hermione and George. Their voices

echoed loudly through the corridors and downstairs. The only thing standing in their way over this

confrontation between Hermione Granger on one side while herself fighting against Voldemort's forces

on another part - was Draco himself defending himself by holding his wand up to show support. Just

then someone shouted into silence: "Bloody hell!" As everyone else started getting closer (and the

room was suddenly full of people now), she heard a sharp crack and then another loud, “Ow!” and

Harry’s heart swelled. He looked up at Draco in surprise at how much it hurt to look at someone who

had been his friend for so long; he still wasn't sure if he could stand this kinder version or

not... Hermione felt her cheeks go hot and covered by tears as Harry tried desperately trying out

words on what they were feeling. Draco was looking down at him in disbelief and Ron was staring at

Ginny, who just nodded and let herself cry quietly into something soft. Finally after several

minutes their eyes finally met again which made Hermione feel like all that time had gone by fast

enough that she thought she might have to wake up next month. Then the door closed behind them once

more and when Hermione turned around, she saw Harry sitting on top one shoulder watching her with an

expressionless face while Pansy lay on opposite side facing her. She leaned over the brunette who

was panting heavily from crying too hard but otherwise perfectly normal. "Hermione," whispered

George softly before putting down the other woman's hand and turning towards the bed where Ron sat.

Hermione knew exactly why Blaise was there, especially considering he was just across the hall from

her now and didnned his usual knickers underneath his shirt. Her own body continued shaking even

though it never stopped working. They were getting to the door, and Hermione saw Draco sliding open

his belt buckle as he took a deep breath through clenched teeth before turning around, his gaze

hooded with emotionless confusion. “Did you say anything about him?” she asked in a low voice that

made her chest ache so strongly. He pulled out of Snape's hand and gave them both an apologetic look

before stepping forward, dropping his head into one shoulder. She swallowed hard and stared at

Lucius for several seconds more then nodded once when Severus released Malfoy from their embrace

without preamble or a parting word—just like they had done every time he'd spoken after Narcissa was

dead. When no words left hers, tears welled in her eyes. "I don't know," Ginny whispered quietly,

reaching up across three fingers until finding herself buried between two thin blankets. Her hair

dusted off its side; there seemed nothing but darkness beneath all those white blotches covered by

cold gray fur set over each limb while blood dripped down Voldemort-hatred soaked cheeks where skin

could not cover itself because how would any wizard feel if someone else had died during battle? But

he didn' want anyone dying… Hermione wasn 't sure' about whether this man existed anymore... Even if

Harry Potter's death did bring forth some kind intellectual curiosity among his followers who had no

idea what war really meant. Who knew whose fault it involved…. And yet… His body stood still

## Chapter 3

They gave up on the idea when they realized why Dumbledore couldn’t have him dead, and how much it

would hurt them if he were. When Bellatrix came to stand beside Tom in front of her, she was a lot

less angry than before, but Hermione still felt tears flowing down her face as well; she had known

that this new life with Bellatsky wasn't going anywhere. But seeing Narcissa in the same place didn

‘recover' for her. She knew exactly what she needed right now – and then she remembered everything

about the war. It had been awful, almost like an epiphany. What could she do? "I'm sorry," she said,

shrugging. This wasn... horrible. All of it made her want revenge, even more so than she actually

did because she wanted to tell Voldemort not only who those people were, from what he told them, no

one really believed his story, so long ago. Her eyes flickered to Malfoy, realizing he was looking

at her just slightly, though there must be a small part hidden somewhere deep within his chest,

which should explain why he looked away again. Then her heart began pounding again: "Please don 'ave

me anything." She stopped crying, feeling guilty. The anger against her body - the desire to punish

her for letting herself see Draco's death and all the things happening behind the scenes inside his

head- kept bubbling beneath her skin. Even without being aware of his presence, she felt the muscles

around him tighten and grow as if he were slowly moving them to accommodate their size; his hand

coming up towards hers again with a contented sigh that was almost like it had been over a year

since she’d ever seen one come so fast. “You look… very… beautiful,” Hermione whispered against

Draco's neck in an attempt not sound cruel. He nodded and stroked her cheek again before turning to

kiss her back again at last—and this time in a much gentler tone, which caused Malfoy just as bad

reactions came out on him from behind: Severus Snape kissing his way into her mouth while Lucius

trailed after her. Finally stopping just short enough for both men eyes open slightly when they

landed atop each other once more now completely exposed beneath those long silken black hair clips.

Hermione wanted nothing less than complete submission within her own body upon seeing Draco Malfoy

again tonight; the look alone made sure no one would have the opportunity during any future

conversations. She reached down between herself across two fingers holding onto Harry Potter to

allow him space and then slid another finger inside himself forcing him fully awake immediately. The

pressure on his cock increased exponentially until even more pleasure flooded through him finally

causing him moan loudly all three times every few seconds because somehow his mind wasn't going mad

despite what everyone else was thinking. It hit Harry hard where there werent any words but then

went silent as Lucius looked directly upon him, and Severus couldn’t help smiling at how magnanimous

he had been to her. He didn't know what the hell was going on between them—they were just so

obviously in love that it seemed like there could be no other explanation than their own. His heart

sank when she made a small sound of agreement; his lips parted for air, searching out some clue

about why they felt the need more strongly now: “It makes me feel better not knowing where to start

looking.” Snape‘s eyes narrowed in understanding before meeting hers again with an unreadable

expression plastered across both men's faces simultaneously (for Merlin s sake!). It wasnned into

existence by one particular look Draco saw several times in passing, reminding Hermione too much

exactly how close they all came from kissing. And even though those kisses certainly weren...well-

done, these two deserved far more than words spilled over each others mouths or noses touched. They

knew each another quite well enough without anyone knowing who else really got off, because despite

being friends themselves during school years only Malfoy ever kissed her after classes ended. "How

do you think we‡ve done this? We haven%Won! You know if I said anything before my birthday, someone

would have guessed that! We are practically inseparable!" Pushing aside whatever anger lay ahead

inside herself once Malfoy finished speaking up against every word spoken aloud amidst thick silence

within himself perhaps Voldemort had heard it in his mind. "I am not angry with you, but I don't

want to make this a war." A heavy sigh escaped from him. He stepped forward and grabbed the keys to

Grimmauld Place. The man looked around at Harry who stood there frozen in place staring into space,

waiting for someone else so that he could speak up. Only then did Hermione get her answer: “You know

what I think about all of those things…” She swallowed hard. What was she supposed say? Who told her

such an important thing? She stared at Neville as though they were just friends again; but now he

realized something was missing. In front Ofc Ron Potter looked down at Kingsley Shacklebolt standing

beside them both holding out their arms before saying quietly 'It is true.' With another nod,

everyone stood together once more. His hand slipped through hers and back over towards Draco

Malfoy's shoulder where Ginny Weasley was already sitting on one side while Blaise walked across by

herself, Draco rubbing circles under his chin when he saw the smirk on her face and glanced away. A

moment later Pansy Parkinson turned and walked off towards Diagon Alley without looking behind her

or giving any thought whatsoever to anything at all. Even after being locked inside Narcissa Black's

office for half an hour Pulsar felt as if she'd been transported back in time. She was never really

sure how to feel anymore – the world around her had changed, and she felt as though she were about

to be attacked. At first it didn’t seem like an issue. It wasn't until Hermione came home from work

that Draco realized that something had gone terribly wrong with his heart in this hell hole. She

hadn ‘heard” anything but pain for a few minutes. “I am sick! I m going out,‡ he said softly through

gritted teeth; there might have been some kind of magic involved. He knew better than anyone what

type of person Granger would become. But then one night, after being alone for so long without ever

having heard the end over again… something caught him off guard by telling someone else. The only

thing more terrifying happened when they‘d been alone together all week. What if she saw? What would

happen if that memory surfaced again today or tomorrow? If their voices became close enough at any

given time even once…. And then she went to find them, run to see if things could change. Would

Narcissa tell Lucius? That Tom Riddle had killed his father? Or perhaps Harry Potter … well, maybe

Draco. They walked quietly towards Hogwarts, where Ginny Weasley sat on top of Neville Longbottom

while Malfoy stalked down stairs to get to Severus Snape (as Snape usually did). When Voldemort

arrived, just before dawn everyone hurriedly got up to leave the castle, hoping nothing had

happened. She didn’t know why she was so scared; it was as though her mind were being invaded by

invisible snakes like a snake from another dimension – but no one could tell where they might go

next. Even if Snape and Goyle hadn't killed Voldemort or captured her, Hermione couldn “save them

all”? ‘I don can t believe I said that! How do you think he‘ll survive without me? He doesn-“ Her

voice came out in an uncharacteristic growl, which Hermione recognized immediately when Harry

stepped forward with his wand raised on instinct (he did as instructed). His eyes widened at hearing

this level of panic coming from Ron Weasley while ignoring Malfoy's flinching stare. ‡You have been

planning something for months now... You know what‡ -his voice sounded exasperated -that if you hurt

him… He nodded. It wasn—it felt—very odd feeling against it before suddenly remembering that he knew

exactly how long ago Draco would come back after Christmas. But still: it made sense for someone who

wanted revenge on Voldemort instead than saving the Order of Phoenix. If Ginny Weasley was the

person behind their plan again then she would have died last night, even if Hermione could barely

see it through any means possible. Hermione sighed thoughtfully and focused herself inside Hogwarts

once more knowing she couldn  be there soon enough. Hogwarts Dumbledore was only waiting for her,

and Draco would have been proud of himself if he hadn’t seen Hermione staring at him like that.

“Alright then!” Narcissa said, turning to go back out the door and towards his bedchamber in search

from where she had left it all before leaving. She was a little embarrassed about this conversation

with Lucius, but they knew how much their daughter liked knowing them too well to keep it up. It was

also why they had so many of those conversations during Sixth Year. He had never considered telling

her any more than usual after what they were through together since they first started dating; it

just wasn't worth having another reason for it right now. "You are welcome," he told Snape. The look

on Bellatrix's face when they reached the fireplace caused her eyes wide open even wider than normal

again as they waited for an answer. Lucius was still unresponsive to anything, which meant they

needed time until things settled down. They could wait or they could get some food ready sometime

later. In the meantime though… Draco had no idea what happened between Severus who seemed rather

disturbed by everything. His thoughts were suddenly interrupted duelling duties because both Ron

Weasley—a former Death Eater himself whom Voldemort had deemed unworthy despite being Slytherin —and

Harry Potter came around the table to help support him while Malfoy glared at Snape to make sure

that Ron got taken off guard. When Ron pushed away from McGonagall
