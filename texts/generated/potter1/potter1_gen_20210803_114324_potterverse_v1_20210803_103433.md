'“Use me…” she breathed, and immediately felt another thrust against her hips'

## Chapter 1

“Use me…” she breathed, and immediately felt another thrust against her hips. ‘Just let me come!’

She couldn't stop, the need in his voice growing. She moved as fast to hit him with it but he

grunted out a command that was louder than anything she had ever heard before; ‡Kiss Draco. I want

you! Fuck me so hard your knickers fall off my face! Please! NOW! I don-I want to… Please, Hermione

Granger...please - make me cum! And then fuck me harder like this, yes, please, Draco Malfoy! It's

time for the next release! Come on baby, now! Show me how much better we can be together again! You

know what will happen when those last three fingers start fucking you?  †Hermione?!‭ Harry shouted

at Ron. He quickly grasped Hermione‾s wrists by both arms and pulled them away from each other,

locking their mouths tightly around one another until they were kissing eachother passionately. They

continued hugging each others body while taking turns on different moves. When Hermione was ready

though there wasn said move of any kind made between them. If they didn wouldnt give her consent

either would kiss or give him whatever it took to get close enough for them all not just to touch.

The only thing holding up was Hermione wanting the world to accept her being completely yours right

now and Lucius Malfoy getting to keep her captive over dinner. She was about halfway through that

meal when she heard Harry’s voice, “I think he has a surprise for you tonight in the library at

Hogwarts." Hermione froze as Ron started up towards him and she stared into his eyes as if trying

not make eye contact with how hard it had hit him just now so far out of breath on topboard—her body

already beginning gooseflesh under them both... "Ah!" The redhead exclaimed with a grin. He and

Potter walked back toward their respective seats, while Draco made an elegant bow to Crabbe, who

dropped his head politely before joining Weasley in front from behind. ‘What do I have here? Is this

a gift or something?" Neville asked, looking down at himself before grabbing Hermione by either side

with one hand and pulling her forward slightly until they were standing shoulder-width apart. It

took several seconds for Harry's hand inside then let go with enough force that Ginny”d yelped

faintly; Hermione noticed it too and turned around awkwardly. Ron appeared to be staring at all

three young Gryffindors but she didn't even flinch away anymore. Their eyes met again before

Snape sed, sending sparks of light across Slytherin tables and walls. They began circling him

quickly after noticing what happened, but it wasnt long before everyone fell silent. When Blaise

noticed Severus watching closely, Kingsley shot him another look of mild concern. “You’ve only made

yourself vulnerable to his wrath once—since the Revel,” he continued and then stopped abruptly,

shaking his head. The man stared back at Draco with a strange expression that looked familiar in its

intensity but seemed foreign without being foreseen or concealed by Hermione's memory; it was so

unlike any she had ever seen before from her childhood home alone - not even here on this earth...

‘I have seen enough of you over the years as well! I have even seen your face in my memories…‡ He

stood frozen for several moments, eyes locked on Harry who lifted his chin up slightly and nodded

solemnly. Theo watched silently as Pansy took the edge off the floor and ducked behind Malfoy s

desk, looking down into Potter eye level. And just like that they were both free-falling towards

each other. Their hands brushed against one shoulder, and Theo felt the familiar tension build

within his body until finally breaking away entirely. His chest tightened painfully beneath their

fingers. But when they broke apart there wasn't time. In fact neither did anyone else appear close

enough either because of how close they could be now—by the force inherent around them that Draco

couldn  not begin noticing anymore. With every passing second the room grew more tense and blurrier,

making Draco almost forget about his existence all together again. Instead Granger stepped forward,

grabbing Draco roughly by the elbow and dragging him over to his side. “You’re a good boy for me?”

he asked as they reached their feet. He was quiet relieved at the praise; it had been her opinion

that she preferred Slytherins over other houses because of how well he treated them. But then again…

if she were her own best friend, she would have been more comfortable with being ignored than having

no one in her life treat her poorly. Her only problem now however... She didn't want any man on top

all day long just yet—and when she did get there first things needed immediate attention. And Draco

didn' think so. The silence stretched around them until Hermione leaned against Harry's bedside

table and held out both hands toward Malfoy before sitting down next Toogy Nott chair across from

hers once they settled. "Draco," Lucius said quietly through clenched teeth. When Ron was still

awake and not looking at anyone else or waiting for help (as in tired?), Blaise nodded silently

while Theo cleared his throat. After Harry calmed down enough after spending some time with Granger

this morning — he wasn 'fucking bored,' but he knew better than words how much longer he could hold

himself back without hurting anyone. It was clear to Harry why Potter was calling him that name

right about now: he wanted everyone knowing who Voldemort really stood for; he saw it reflected

vividly in every crevice between each eye; even where Blaise was perched on the edge of a tree, he

could see the light from Hermione’s wand. Draco knew it must have been for her benefit—because he‘d

seen it before in his nightmares, but seeing that look made him want to vomit; Lucius looked like an

old man who had fallen out with Theo and then just happened across something stupidly harmless

enough not worth mentioning at all: Pansy Parkinson has no idea what she is doing here either! But

when Malfoy opened up one more crack toward Fleur's bedside table (which didn't seem so bad after

all), there were several bottles piled atop its surface as well. What did they do? “This bottle will

help you sleep now if I give your arm some privacy, because my hand doesn-  we don t-take any

chances. So good luck," said Snape beside them both reading over their quills while Severus peered

over Fluffy into another corner near hers plastered above Crookshanks figurine hung loosely against

Narcissa Botts sofa cushions next door behind Harry Potter sitting down at breakfast 'til noon. When

Granger appeared again without looking up or looking back through those chignon caps draped around

herself holding hands along soft carpeting laid out beside Luna Lovegood sat down cross legged and

crossed eyed. The lioness had just finished eating dinner when someone pulled a chair by itself and

called out orders for everyone else seated. "Go ahead, you two," she told them, giving Draco a wide

smile and turning to leave the room at that point; Hermione was thankful they hadn't lost her as she

thought about how she'd been able to hold onto him all this time. She knew he would never be

completely honest with her on his own, but had it not worn off with the loss of all their trust? To

have felt like such an ally in her life when she saw him so completely disregarding everything

around herself? It wasn’t something she planned or planned upon doing very often right now. But

knowing that there were some things which made him feel different than before, and what needed

changed from what it was she wanted to do after telling him again last night… well, no matter who

did what to her instead if she could just tell Harry first thing tomorrow morning where he was. Now

that she was confident enough in what she hoped to accomplish—and only partially —she started to

worry internally. As soon though Tom Riddle came into view, she became aware once more why Dolohov's

eyes gleamed green. “What is it, princess?" Her voice carried through the castle, the words like

thunder making its way down her throat. The small elf nodded silently while Hermione stood up, arms

crossed over her chest. In the distance away one long arm wrapped around himself whilst another

clasped his waist. He leaned against her slightly, sliding them both into the bed and closing them

off with a soft kiss on top of their head while he slid his hands up her sides to cradle her back

against him slowly as she cried out for more breath. “Fuck!” Hermione groaned but instead sat up

quickly, trying not to cum from this experience. Draco grabbed her arm again and pulled her close

before letting go and gently massaging a small hole in her belly, forcing himself inside her deeply.

Hermione was panting heavily when he let go roughly at the same time. She tried taking another deep

breath to calm herself down, but it seemed like all that would happen now was they could be together

and they wouldn't have any issues. When he broke the kiss, he placed a hand over hers so tightly she

almost fell backwards onto one side, pushing through his fingers even harder than she had been

previously since. Her hips began rocking forward until finally she came undone completely by the

time he started pulling free of his hold. His lips were biting into hers hard enough each time she

whimpered harshly; hot and sticky, and there wasn't much stopping him if she continued to moan or

beg about it. Slowly, the release hit her tight stomach causing her body quivering violently. They

both looked away momentarily before turning their attention towards what felt like the most

important task yet. Malfoy sat next Granger's lap, rubbing at partaking once upon piece between

them. The way her

## Chapter 2

“Use me…” she breathed, and immediately felt another thrust against her hips. The muscles of his

abdomen were pushing into the hollow as he was rubbing himself with a gentle hand, but at this point

Hermione could feel it coming down onto them both in an almost painful way that she couldn't quite

describe or explain to anyone else. She didn't want him going anywhere; she just wanted to get rid

off her skin, even though this wasn- ‘her cunt is yours! I won tarry you for ages if ever there has

been one!" A powerful release came from the centre somewhere between their bodies, the sound like

something deep inside Hogwarts where Harry Potter could be heard talking under His own voice. Her

breath hitched painfully when Draco Malfoy stepped closer. He looked so beautiful, Lucius thought

jokingly while watching Hermione playfully around Snape's cock before pulling back enough away to

kiss her mouth again: "And now, my Lord." Notes - thanks to Endless_musings who wrote those notes

myself but also sharing some sexy pictures below :) Chapter 26: You Made Me Trust You Summary – June

13th, 2003 One day after he started using Legilimency on Hermione Granger, Bellatrix Lestrange

finally decided they had got through yet two days without being caught. The Ministry had already

made arrangements to hold a free clinic in the city, so a private clinic would be needed for anyone

wanting an abortion. She still had a few things she wanted done differently. “I won’t get into too

much detail on what I want until you tell me everything that is going at it and where we are going.

And then when all this happens… I have to go back home and find my mother.” He smiled widely at her

as he crossed his arms over his chest and kissed her forehead before leaving them alone together

with Blaise again after another moment of silence. Chapter 50: A Tale Of Two Sisters Summary:

Prompt: "Mione? What happened?" —— Pairing: Hermione Granger/Draco Malfoy Notes from Author's Note:

Hello! My name was PippaKnight who wrote Harry Potter and Ron Weasley chapters one and two while

writing Draco-Riddle (and did not stop short to say the lioness). Thanks so much to everyone

reading!!! Hope you enjoy the chapter. Much love!! Chapter Text Hermione walked down Diagon Alley

towards Flourish & Burkes, having spent time studying with Theo and Blanche since their wedding day

yesterday morning.  Her heart felt heavy inside. Hermione had been planning her escape for weeks now

because there were certain events happening within her life but also because they were just

beginning - such moments as these are rarely anything special. But this time, he felt it too: the

light of a sun that had never washed over his entire body, reflected back to him through fire magic

and brimstone potion. It was like being reborn in eternal flame. The night he woke from sleep had

turned into one long day of absolute terror at having lost his father's life. What if Harry hadn’t?

Would Severus still exist? That wasn't what Draco wanted out loud; for some reason they just

didn—but he knew that feeling wouldn “take forever'  anyway since he would be dead within days. So

now all three were alone on their own with nothing but empty beds where no one could see them apart

by foot or window any longer than necessary… And then there is Sirius who can only go so far when it

comes down To Bellatrix Lestrange she knows nothing. She doesn 'ave told me how she was found

murdered! What did she do? If I weren-' "Lily." A soft voice sounded out on her right. Hermione felt

herself freeze against Snape again before turning back around. He held himself up high and waited

patiently while Lucius stroked her head, studying every inch under James eyes carefully until

finally looking down upon Lily once more... Chapter 38 Notes:-) Like this chapter? Disclaimer:

sitting beside Padma and placing her hands on his shoulders. "I'm going to have a few minutes to

think about this before I start getting in trouble." She felt like she was suffocating with dread as

she pushed off the bed and headed for Lavender's room where Ron had taken her hand. When they were

alone Hermione put on some clothes and went to get a shower, feeling like the older witch wasn't

quite ready for what lay ahead of them when Harry and Neville came into their room by themselves

together after finishing their meal. Ron stepped out from behind the desk and placed an arm around

her waist. He turned to face her slightly but gave her a hard look. ‘Are you alright?’ he asked

softly. They stood frozen at that moment. It was probably best to calm down now or any time soon it

would be too much to bear. 'Hermione - did you just go back to your room?' Ron didnt even know

whether she could hear him right now. The blonde looked up at him, her lips pursed slightly as if

trying not make the words come out. Then she nodded. Something about the way the room still smelled

so strongly of alcohol made Hermione feel like something inside herself was starting creeping

through her. She cleared her throat slightly and moved closer towards Ron then away. Her eyes

widened momentarily thinking of how the man had reacted upon seeing her staring at such thoughts

while staring in horror at her own hands again- And suddenly Harry and Ron’s eyes fell upon him, he

looked completely shocked. Hermione just stared at the redhead for a long moment before she turned

her head and walked away from them with tears in both of their faces as well! “Oh no, I won't have

you crying over that one, alright?” Pansy asked, looking around nervously. She glanced up to see

Draco smiling broadly at Hermione who was staring back at Ginny sitting on an armchair by herself

with another huge, bluebell bottle in hand holding two bottles of Firewhisky. A couple seconds later

they were both running down towards Neville where Mrs Longbottom was standing between himself trying

not so much help but look like someone who would be going mental if she saw something wrong. ‘It‘ll

work okay, Nev. Please tell me what happened after we got here.‪ Hermione spoke up slowly once more

letting out a sigh. ~~~*~~~~ Three weeks after her first time being sent back home Bill Weasley went

into his office when he couldn`t get through Christmas break without getting sick. It had been

almost five months since he left Hogwarts during sixth year and it had only grown worse because the

days passed quickly and ever since then Ginny has been in constant pain. He spent hours crying every

single day while she tried desperately hard make sense or try straighten things out about how he

felt sometimes, especially regarding his relationship issues with Lily Potter. “That is a different

issue. I have tried to think of it more in detail than you did,” he said slowly as she stared at him

sharply for several seconds before nodding again and walking away. The two men stayed outside of the

dorm until they had made their way into Grimmauld Place. Harry and Ron were sitting on one side

while Hermione was trying not even look up when Snape returned from an appointment that evening

after the weekend. She had gotten her wand ready without permission so quickly, but he couldn't be

sure if those wards were still working properly. It seemed like forever, since the man had been

sitting there all week. He could tell by how tense Draco looked that Severus wasnt going anywhere

soon; although, given what happened next, perhaps he wouldn- ‘I believe me!’ ~~~*~~~~ On Friday

morning Tom went back to bed thinking about everything he would need done tomorrow night to get

through this day and this night ahead. Even though he hadn—to himself… He didn' have any idea where

he was heading today. His magic knew exactly where it should go now because of Dumbledore's death

last year. And then there just came another blow against him tonight that no sooner struck him than

he felt the door open. Before anyone could knock, however loud or shrill maybe anything else sounded

off somewhere around them: knocking on doors wide awake. There must've heard something deep inside,

and Hermione didn't know why she was so surprised. She'd never been a fan of books before when it

came to their subject matter or presentation; she felt that the older students were more interested

in the stories on magical creatures than in what they found interesting about them now but not at

all pleased with her lack thereof knowledge regarding such things as mythology & ancient magic (and

especially the non-magical ones). Apparently, most of these students weren’t very fond Of the lore

behind certain types scientifically or magically involved in healing spells either…she could only

guess who those people had asked for interviews earlier this year. However, none seemed particularly

interested nor interested enough right now anyway. The first two questions took her by surprise,

since neither one knew any other wizarding literature beyond Ancient Runes from the time they‘d

entered Hogwarts and hadn “done anything new” research into the topic. No doubt they wanted answers

yet! At least three other students looked confused after the first question while fourth and fifth

year witches and wizards kept asking if there even existed a particular magical creature among the

various magical beings known today...but then again perhaps some teachers would be better off

focusing exclusively upon the newer topics like history because they couldn' t get too far up the

rabbit hole without getting caught. In fact Umbridge wouldn wager that someone might have wandered

through an old book just knowing exactly how many bits there actually are amongst ancient magical

texts. Maybe

## Chapter 3

“Use me…” she breathed, and immediately felt another thrust against her hips. It was a small moan

that reached down and grazed on the underside of his shorts as he continued to push harder until it

tore at every hole in hers completely apart from one other than his cock where both hands clamped

onto each cheek tightly together between them while they pushed him back up further into Draco's

mouth and then again when their mouths met. Hermione shivered slightly before she leaned forward and

pressed herself hard into the slick headboard of Ron Weasley; feeling the pressure of the large hand

gripping her flesh causing the hairs around her arse prickle with goosebumps. She grabbed the

hairline of Ginny Bellatrix Black and squeezed lightly inside her, pulling away instinctively

knowing what it would do to the other witch if she did not stop pushing through her orgasm faster

now. Her body began pulsating wildly under her own thrusts as she fought to catch all three fingers

within her grasp just enough for her eyes open even more. The only thing keeping her out of this

place was their combined breathing and how deeply she gripped Harry’s shoulder holding him close

over everything else surrounding them. ‘You should be quiet!  Hermione cried louder but still

managed despite Ginny shouting behind her. They stood there for several seconds trying desperately

get control because they were sure they wouldn't hear anything except themselves, but soon they

heard voices coming closer. All four wizards tried standing straight so they came face-to’face,

while a group of three witches and wizarding folk laughed at the sheer delight in their expressions.

Hermione couldn't help but to laugh as she watched the proceedings unfold. It was an interesting

game of cat and mouse… The Wizards had both been raised by family members who were proud that they

hadn't had children yet—they had kids with their own magical families that didn -their children” She

finished, watching them exchange looks. “The first one was a redhead named Ronald Weasley Weasley,

whose father is killed during his funeral... He doesn? Really isn.' The witches laughed, each

laughing at her every word as they shared their excitement about it for themselves; Ron smiled back,

and Harry joined him on some other side duelling course that afternoon. They all looked up from

passing pairs when Draco Malfoy arrived just after lunch. His eyes landed on Pansy Parkinson before

he knew what happened next: Daphne Greengrass stood beside herself and gave birth under cold water

several hours later than she usually did. Popsicle sized twins Katie Bell (who still had babies),

Tracey Davis Longbottom III lay on topof Neville's lap, clutching Teddy between two hands as well

like Ginny cried over the news this morning. After a few moments more into training classes,

Professor Slughorn introduced himself once again amongst those gathered around tables and sent out a

single class invitation containing a question where everyone would answer by answering the question.

There were three more to go, and Hermione was determined not just get one of them right, but then

they all could play their own game in what she hoped did nothing to undermine Draco’s confidence

that he would win. In the end Malfoy turned around, ignoring her every attempt at hiding his

annoyance with Granger or putting up any resistance as if it were the only way to defeat him for

once: “Did you find out about my confession?” She finally asked. Draco nodded again; there had been

no response from either side so they both focused on other things instead — whether he really was

confessing or not. He knew now that they were together enough already anyway because of the Dark

Mark… But even though the two men didn't seem upset, it was clear they felt compelled (which gave

him pause) towards questioning something else. The fact that Granger had taken notes meant she was

aware—and likely actively trying against everything he had tried to keep to himself – that this

might be the last time anyone saw her. And maybe someday when the war ended, someone who could

challenge him wouldn-be able too. Maybe Voldemort would show some interest in the young witch. It

wasnt going very well. Finally Lucius snorted at the thought before turning back to Severus giving

Snape an apologetic look. Then Dolohov sighed at Bellatrix sitting across her from Potter watching

her intently while Daphne took a seat on the armchair in front of him. She was sitting by herself

looking at one page and flipping through it, trying to remember what she had read that day. "Well?"

Her voice came out sounding quite strained when she finally spoke. Harry turned his eyes up into

hers. He didn't want their conversation disturbed if they would need more time to get settled. His

hand cupped her cheek and then rested against Hermione's. When he looked down at himself again for a

moment as he thought about her comment earlier this week about being too sensitive during class so

far away… "I think you should have said something." She shrugged slightly before turning back to

look at Draco. There were times where he seemed completely flattered with just seeing her smile even

when other people around them were clearly uncomfortable; but also when things like that happened

sometimes. It wasn’t surprising to him now that she was here knowing how she reacted. “What?” Ron

asked, not bothering raising his eyebrows or leaning forward closer to her. Hermione nodded. They

continued to sit there for several moments before nodding once together. Eventually, Ron pulled off

his shirt and stepped over to place an elegant kiss onto her forehead. Then, he leaned close enough

to whisper gently into the soft skin that formed between her lips. As soon after, Dora rose up next

towards Harry who stood beside Scorpius and looked directly at him curiously. While all the other

girls had assumed he was a sex worker, Hermione knew she didn’t need to hear them out right now; she

wanted Severus in her life and getting engaged would be an important piece of information for both

their budding love lives—and they were already in the process that could be used as evidence in

court. “I know you are open about your sexuality but I just can't imagine how much more time we will

have if any one else is involved? It seems like such a long wait..." He started rifling through his

books, then took another sip of his coffee before turning back around once more into Lucius's

waiting room where Draco sat behind Snape on Narcissa' bed with Scorpius at each side looking over

Malfoy by ear while Goyle stroked himself. With tears dripping from Harry eyes every few moments

until nearly spilling down onto Ron when Theo turned away to look at Ginny who smiled at Blaise.

"We'll see what happens," said Draco after a momentary silence stretched between those two adults

watching this scene unfold. Ginny nodded slowly taking a deep breath holding Draco still close to

hers kissing her cheek softly closing her eyes clutching his shoulder whispering into his chest

against which the heat continued spreading up her body. It had taken several minutes before she felt

completely safe enough to come face-to -face again. She closed her mouth finding the gentle hold of

Riddle's lips pressing against it gently squeezing her hand away. She felt his fingers tugging at

the fabric of hers and she shook as though he were trying to break free, but in a desperate attempt

not-yet released from being trapped under him. He held her gaze for several moments before he

finally let go once more and Hermione couldn't help noticing that her body was starting trembling

slightly with panic attacks. It was only when he pulled back towards Snape's office that Lucius

noticed what had just happened between them; Draco Malfoy was standing there in front of their desk,

looking terrified. "Draco," Severus said after an awkward pause. His eyes narrowed dangerously as

his forehead wrinkled slightly. The man had been lying on top off floor of one bed while they waited

outside over dinner. When Granger asked him about something other than how long ago this weekend

went by without any news or updates to come out within minutes then Marcus quickly moved forward

putting both hands behind himself keeping them firmly planted on either side facing him down hard

enough so no matter what anyone else thought or saw."She says you're not going anywhere," Riddle

said softly. While everyone stared up his glasses Malfoy gave another nod before turning his

attention back to where Kingsley sat. "...what is it?" With everything that has transpired since the

last time they had sex Hermione didn’t even know if this could be worse than it already seemed until

now...but perhaps tomorrow? They would all get together again soon. Chapter 17: A Simple Guide

Summary: Prompt: "Did you enjoy the book?" — “Mione,” Harry says as he sits down at a table in her

living room, looking out over his balcony. Hermione has never wanted to share with anyone what

happened during their fight last year and it wasn't until she learned that they were dueling for the

first time ever! The anger from when Malfoy got hurt on Halloween was palpable; however...he had

also been angry about everything else because he didnned robes or did something stupid after leaving

Hogwarts due to guilt. They talked through the whole thing but werent able tell anything apart from

'I don' and things like this. She can hardly believe how much better than just being friends now

without him - knowing who Draco really is made me happy by his bravery. Plus, I know there's always

an element of revenge behind every Slytherin party we go too. It was kind enough for me not want my

family involved." Pairings: Weasley & Potter Notes: (See the end notes before editing) Hermione POV
