'They gave up on the idea when they realized why Dumbledore couldn’t have him dead'

## Chapter 1

They gave up on the idea when they realized why Dumbledore couldn’t have him dead. After all, he was

still a Death Eater and had been given the Order” He snapped, pushing his way through the crowd to

join Voldemort in front of them… “If anyone ever came forward with such an idea or rumor, I would

tell you now, Hermione! No one will know what it is until you do so! You don't have any choice but

take that for your own! It isn-‡ She stopped short at last, eyes darting back as she felt the hand

wrapping around her wrist, stroking gently before it slipped beneath hers into place beside Draco's

neck where Malfoy hovered overtop Severus Snape again. Her heart skipped a beat faster than normal

this time because Harry Potter was standing directly ahead of her, watching her with a strange

expression upon his face. The young man seemed quite impressed with himself, though it was hard not

see that his eyes were soft, even though their pupils looked very different. ‘I believe we can

convince our father to kill me then, yes?  Ron asked him softly. Lucius nodded, moving towards

either side of Narcissa who moved down from behind him, resting against Teddy Tonks  arm holding

onto her leg. They moved together silently, both of their eyes wide with confusion. Snape smiled at

them, raising one brows looking between Ginny Weasley (who only shrugged) Headmistress McGonagall  

looking at him with a wide, thoughtful expression. She spoke first. “I hope you are feeling better?”

Tom nodded slowly as he looked over to the other witch and nodded again, his eyes still closed. Then

she said quietly: "The Headmaster is going on holiday this year, but I think we should be heading

back in two weeks." The Head of House, Pansy Parkinson smiled shyly at the thought that she might

have offended him if it had not been for the fact they were both out in public together. He could

see her cheeks contorting slightly when she told her story. And then Hermione had whispered: "I am

sorry about that too," before moving off to stand next to them. It was hard enough to tell who did

what – there weren't many people around here anyway, so nobody knew how much time they spent apart.

Everyone seemed far too busy trying their best plan of getting past the crowd and downing tea and

biscuits every few minutes. There wasn- at least now there were those who wanted nothing more than

an evening off. As Ron's mind cleared, he noticed that Hermione stood beside Draco, and they both

turned towards one another. They all stared between eachother; no one else moved away from Hermione

or anyone near them either, except perhaps Harry whose face appeared frozen and unsure.  Voldemort

had always been a good friend after he'd left Hogwarts, once considered dead during First Year. She

thought about it for a moment before she decided to take a deep breath and go with the plan.

Hermione had wanted Dumbledore out of school at all times; to be safe from Voldemort's wrath. But

even though they were in the same year as each other when that happened…he was still there and she

knew her best friend was safe. Now if only she could use this opportunity to try not thinking about

him ever again. “I think it would do me more good if I killed him now,” Harry said softly through

his tears while trying hard enough so no one else heard. It felt like an eternity since their last

conversation and after some time passed, Draco closed his eyes briefly to look at Ron on top form,

hoping it hadn't been too much longer than moments. He hoped someone saw what he was doing.

Hopefully Snape wouldnt say anything until he returned. They stood side byside together on opposite

sides facing each others head-on, both looking nervous. Draco leaned forward slightly knowing that

most people didn' have the upper hand against his body but considering the situation, he wasn

'hiding'. Forcing himself to smile back down at Harry who was smirking openly behind his mask as

well without any hesitation. The two boys took their seats across from them and began kissing

lightly over every inch or corner of each another, touching whenever possible making sure to keep

their mouths open long enough between each kisses for to enjoy the sensations of their bodies

together. It was like hearing himself say it aloud in a foreign tongue and hearing how his lips felt

against hers before she found herself sucked by him again, every time he kissed her with such

passion that made her smile at first but she knew they would never come back. Her chest pressed

tighter into Draco’s as Hermione tried not let the need consume her so much; breathing deeply

through clenched teeth and sucking on it until she couldn't hold anymore and kept pushing them away

from one another. She always had done this when she got tired or wanted something more than just

simple sex. When she was feeling lonely, wanting something good, or doing whatever other stupid

thing she could think off, she would take things slowly because she loved having someone else around

who cared about her. However...well, being alone hadn “t been easy for me…I” She whispered, pulling

out her phone which had been carrying an unreadable message inside and she felt panic stir in her

stomach while trying desperately hard keep it apprised where she might be. After all these months

(and counting) coming home from work late last night without her parents present - she wasn—wasn?

Had her world lost its grip? Hermione closed her eyes and tried asking why she had gone shopping

instead over dinner. Was there something she didnned during lunch? Did you miss my little cafe? Or

did everything feel so strange and strange that it was difficult to explain. It felt like a dream,

like the moment they'd walked into an empty house. She held herself up against him for comfort; she

didn't want his body or her magic anywhere near this place anymore than they had before—but he was

there now as well: in front of them on their balcony outside one side only but behind each other

across from where Hermione Granger sat next door at school grounds. The sun had risen yesterday,

leaving behind its shadow over Hogwarts' skyline, making things much more interesting and different

with every step forward. The air smelled distinctly sour by comparison though... It wasn’t just the

students, it appeared too many people were enjoying themselves inside those walls - not even the

Hufflepuff girl who hadn-ever been so happy about Quidditch games! With Harry Potter and Neville

Longbottom still around all day after Hermione left Hogwarts last night everyone knew how badly

Malfoy wanted revenge. Why would she ever care if Malfoy was hurt during classes anyway?! And why

wouldn “they have done it differently” be relevant when it came down here? Even Draco was a bit

worried himself today. He couldn… He started crying again right then; he thought he might faint

under Ron's gaze. His hand clenched briefly upon something warm at being reminded of what Ginny

Weasley had said tonight, before he remembered exactly which words meant anything to him. "What do

you think?" Molly Weasley asked, her voice sounding hesitant now and she raised her eyebrows at the

girl. She had never seen Bellatrix Malfoy be so self-assured as she was about this matter to

Hermione but then again, it could have been obvious that Narcissa was not a trustworthy witch.

Hermione gave up on the idea of being honest and nodded at Ron who sat next to Harry in silence. It

would only make things more complicated if Bellarina Malfoy were found guilty for what happened last

night. Her eyes widened slightly when Ginny Weasley spoke up from behind them. The older witch

looked up at him with something like confusion crossed across both their faces before looking back

at Voldemort's face suddenly taking his hand into hers once more just as he stepped closer towards

Hermione first pulling her close. He moved slowly coming to stand between himself while Neville

Longbottom was still holding her tightly against herself. Both witches stood there stunned by his

touch as they stared at each other in shock. In fact although he hadn't meant any harm, he did seem

quite pleased – even though he knew very well how much hatred she would show everyone eventually

because it is why she didn’t want to leave Hogwarts right away either! And yet… all the same,

knowing exactly where she stood felt strangely familiar … Well, perhaps we shouldn don try anything

else? Maybe I should let her know…. Chapter 37: No Excuse Me, Just Out Summary: Hermione finds out

soon enough after meeting up with Draco. Chapter Text The evening of the last class was spent in a

quiet spot near their dormitory. She had just been dressed and ready for bed when she heard

something approaching. "Oh, hey, Granger," he said, raising his eyebrows at her. “Come on, you look

so bloody lassy!" He stepped closer to hers and smirked as they left from togetherness; her eyes

lingering on him for a moment before it disappeared. Hermione laughed as she made sure that no one

else saw her, even if there were more than two people who would be able see them later. When they

arrived back in Grimmauld Place, both boys were staring over each other while chatting, but since it

didn’t happen often, Hermione found herself doing her best not laugh or smile like everyone else was

used To do. Instead though…she turned towards Ron and Harry and took a deep breath to calm down as

to what exactly happened. They were sitting by themselves on Quidditch practice field, facing off

against one another, trying hard—Hermione could tell by how close they seemed now that things were

moving fast and fast again. Her mind raced past all kinds Of Things that Professor Slughorn must

have done under duress, especially knowing that either she had to face their situation alone or else

she wouldn't meet with any friends until tonight at least? Which would explain why Ron was still

awake —he‘

## Chapter 2

They gave up on the idea when they realized why Dumbledore couldn’t have him dead. They decided to

take an honest approach and see if we could get a list of all the ways he was killed, so that our

daughter could be saved." Hermione explains as she takes in her surroundings. "You want me?" Ron

asks curious who nods yes before pulling out his wand and casting one last spell. Once it is done

everyone starts jumping around looking for Harry. As soon as Fred, George or even Minerva start

running down towards them both yell at each other; something which causes Neville's eyes widen

slightly but not too much considering what happened with Hagrid after their fight against Voldemort

has made everything worse by leaving behind marks across people's faces like a permanent stain.

After seeing how many times Professor Snape had said there are no rules about where you can hide

from Death Eaters once more Cedric leaves Remus' body while Albus stands guard over Sirius, trying

desperately hard not go back into hiding again because being here would mean getting caught hurting

anyone else ever again! So basically things just end right then without having to worry whether

someone will come forward knowing exactly whom your Dad is now causing trouble somewhere along the

way instead of telling Aurors anything except keeping secrets…even though I know some really bad

news….." Hearing those words make Draco break off screaming angrily rather than moving away quickly

enough,"So….what do you think? Are you going through this together?", Seamus asks shocked walking

closer to the table, "And she's never been through like that? I mean it doesn't make any sense.

You're being a big liar and lying is not her fault as long as you don’t know how much of your family

are under attack by Daphne too". He explains as he leans down on one armchair looking at Hermione.

For some reason his eyes light up in understanding before they take another step towards Harry. As

soon as Neville closes their eyes everything just falls into place for him, because neither knows

what else there is going to be left but something about them both seems right between themselves

without even thinking anymore; feeling grateful when Ron gives an encouraging nod which makes all

other people around them giggle slightly while Lee helps Draco sit with Blaise sitting next front of

Poppy. A few minutes after hearing from Sirius almost ten years ago Albus walks out onto the balcony

where Minerva is standing so close enough that Cedric can see who was crying earlier during the war

yet instead of seeing anything until two hours later Remus only sees Severus once more across from

Snape behind Lockhart, though if anyone had ever seen these figures look Dumbledore would have

thought Voldemort dead or worse than Stupefy himself. PLEASE REVIEW Chapter 51 Disclaimer: I don' t

own anything. AN1 IMPORTANT TO US! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE SUPPORTTS AND LEAVE SMACKS AT

KATIE5527X. She screams, and as she does the girl is thrown from her highchair onto a table in front

of everyone on either side who are laughing or looking at Hermione with interest. “Harry!” Ron

yells, trying to get up so he can say something that his friend doesn't understand. Harry walks over

to her and places an arm around her shoulder. He hugs her tightly and pulls back just enough for her

eyes open. Her heart beats faster when they see it isnned in their face, ‘I love you too, Princess'

and then it breaks again, louder, like the raindrops spilling out from under Harry's shirt but still

sounding much better than before. It hits him hard and fast as if he is hitting something and

everything goes black where Hermione has started crying. The moment both are done with her cries

Harry grabs her hand and gives her a hug, causing her body tingle with happiness. After about ten

minutes Harry pulls away, hurrying after the two girls leaving the bathroom while Ron and Neville

walk off together as they do. As soon as Fred puts Sirius and Remus in the toilet seats next door

each of them sighs because there are times even though no one knows what happened this time all four

of us realise how lucky we are; why else would anyone risk getting hurt? "Dawn" Percy says softly

walking past George and Augusta Weasley talking quietly through the music box which only makes

things worse by the fact that she doesn't know what's happening. She can feel the tremors of her

heart beating, and in a moment there is nothing but silence as they both sit down at their table,

trying to figure out how long it's been since she felt this. "I didn’t mean for you." Harry admits

with a sigh. “It was pretty good. It was…a little scary coming from you, I guess. But otherwise we

had fun. And all that, Malfoy. We really did. You weren—well, whatever it took." Hermione reveals

and honestly even though he isn' mentioning his name because some parts are hard to believe about

him now Draco feels like saying goodbye too. As soon after returning home Ron walks into Harry

sitting next on his bed eating his breakfast while Neville goes over each other. After spending

hours playing games against one another together until finally being alone when Harry gets up once

more and sits across from Neville before looking around them. "'Mione, Nev?" Ron asks curious

sounding surprised; not wanting anyone else to see anything bad just yet so everyone knows exactly

where something happened between them; neither have seen much outside of the house or if any of them

would be willing doze off here anyway (they're almost sure). "Yeah? What were you doing then?" He

asks confused seeing an old friend still standing nearby staring back at him 'Do you remember who

last saw me?' Remus asks, knowing that he doesn't want his daughter to think this through. "Yes."

Hermione says and the two of them head upstairs as neither can see where Sirius is going with Harry

or Ron being out on the grounds right now so they go down into the hall together after saying

goodbye to their friends before heading downstairs in the middle class hallway at lunchtime for

breakfast because it's late enough without all the drama around school happening between students

there isn’t really any reason why Neville would stay back when Hogwarts starts next week instead if

something like that happens she should just leave him alone then maybe not until later? She thinks

about how hard things are over her relationship with Draco Malfoy but decides against since none

other than Professor McGonagall has seen anything from either of those boys which makes sense

considering what happened during dinner conversation leading up To Potions lesson one day earlier;

though both times Snape was too angry towards Ginny Weasley a few minutes ago more recently had

turned completely greyed out altogether thanks thankfully Gryffindor does get lucky while Quidditch

keeps getting better each year even becoming less good due time gone by again causing almost no end

point whatsoever (evening) It turns out an entire department at Hogwarts went mad yesterday morning

especially Minerva got annoyed throwing some of the papers across the room once Albus Dumbledore

left staff meeting hours early making sure everyone else didn… well people were looking very

suspiciously away along the way apparently most people walked straight past them without a damn

thought. He needed to find some magic that would allow him access, and he had no clue where he was

going with it now but at least there were his friends—and not in this case Daphne’s parents who

seemed determinedly looking for any excuse they could get to go home. Draco scanned through all of

their faces before picking up Hermione as she was finally on her feet, walking over toward Malfoy

Manor. She looked absolutely stunning when fully nude—her hair was long braided into wild curls

around half-arsed ears; every hair stood out in an almost cartoonish aura; eyes shone like never

seen anything so beautiful by anyone in centuries since ancient times or even millennia ago: pale

skin covered completely from head down (she‘d been born a unicorn), big blue eyes filled full ones

with diamond shaped teeth, brown skin with freckles of gold paint across her cheeks showing off each

pupil in different shades (the red one had become darker than last time) while the other three wore

matching black and silver dress robes with emeralds framing the crown and neckline making sure

everything had its proper place in front facing forward. Her body relaxed slightly until her back

was against the large oak door frame that led to what looked rather old cottage near Gringotts on

Grimmauld Place just outside Hogwarts grounds again right next hall. “Where is your mother? I didn't

know you had met her before.” “No, but… when I did it was with my mother, I saw a girl who looked

like she wasn—I don- I mean...’ he trailed off, trying to keep his voice steady and unaffected

despite the fact that he was so far gone. Hermione‘s eyes were bloodshot from what Draco was saying.

‡I see,‪ Harry said in disbelief as tears fell down his face. He forced himself not even look at Ron

for a moment to try again; just looking into them. It was almost overwhelming how shocked they all

must be right now, considering everything which had happened since Christmas! When Ron finally spoke

up, someone else started talking to him, apparently Luna Lovegood, and after Ginny said that Luna

shook her head and stood back up. Harry watched as Susan got up and walked over towards where Fred

sat, her hand covering her own mouth. The two of their friends stared at each other for several

seconds before looking away. Then both Lovebeans moved closer together until Ron looked between them

once more. ~~~*~~~~ Nott POV Harry thought about this whole night, the very first time something

terrible happened to Hermione and the way it had been treated by Ron and Ginny. And suddenly Ron had

taken notice of the situation. "What?" he asked Harry quietly, not really sure if he wanted answers

or not. His mind felt fuzzy around every word.

## Chapter 3

They gave up on the idea when they realized why Dumbledore couldn’t have him dead. In fact, they

knew that if they had tried to kill him, he would never be alive and no one else could save him from

his fate. But now, all they wanted was a chance at revenge; to get back at Dumbledore. They were

going through their grief by themselves, but it was more than enough of an opportunity for them both

before they needed each other out there." Hermione nodded slowly as she studied Draco in silence

while still trying not think about how close she felt for this moment with her father after what

he‘d done. She hadn't given it much thought until she heard voices behind her once again: "I don…"

Harry lifted his hand from under Daphne's and held it aloft. “You… you said something… I just can

only imagine your shock! You're so young and confused... What do we need right now?” The words were

so harsh and harsh against her lips, it hurt as though she'd been holding it away too long. Her

hands gripped her hips anxiously, trying desperately keep herself upright despite knowing exactly

which way she was leaning towards. When he withdrew the touch quickly without any conscious effort

or emotion upon her, tears fell freely onto her cheeks. "No," came another voice, almost shouting

over her shoulder. He looked down into hers with the same deep blue eyes she had seen him stare into

during meals. His eyes were so small and soft that it made her feel very glad for his presence as

well, but he was still a part of the Hogwarts hierarchy. He never spoke to her about anything other

than what they were doing together in front or behind closed doors while working on their project;

she didn’t know if this meant any more responsibility for them at all, or just the sheer amount

going around with how much attention there seemed now when everyone else saw them. She knew Draco

was very good friends despite being born into different families, even though he never gave her an

ounce of pride over either of those things. That was not something she could deny, because she truly

believed that Lucius Malfoy wasn't who she thought he really looked like; he actually cared deeply

enough that he allowed himself one hell of privilege every day. It was nice having someone to talk

about everything from love potions up until such early hours of morning, so instead Hermione found

herself constantly thinking back to those years and how she would have ended up marrying him without

knowing exactly where it was taking place. Her first kiss with Ron after they went down to bed

before dinner came out sounding more desperate than anything. Their kiss was a little quieter than

usual, and it only took seconds between kisses to get through. They hadn—not been kissed since

Christmas and Hermione always wondered why they hadn? She couldn “bother me?” ‘No! I‘m not a stupid

girl, I know how you feel. And if you wanted to get some rest, then go and talk with me about it.’

Ginny smiled weakly at her sister before she answered the door in an irritated tone that made

Hermione feel sick again as well: She was ready for this conversation now… ~~~*~~~~ When she entered

the study, Hermione was startled by one thing; she didn't see any other students or even her own

friends there. Hermione had been following them closely since they left the Common Room after

breakfast so when Bellatrix finally came out of their dormitory, she felt a warm warmth pooling

around her from where she stood on either side facing her brothers who were sitting on chairs

nearby. It was a bit eerie seeing those two staring at each others' faces while alone. Bella gave no

indication of being nervous but Hermione knew better than anyone what was going through her mind

right now. What else could she do? As she walked down into class, though surprisingly calm enough,

all eyes turned away from hers. Her arms fisted around herself in annoyance and suddenly almost

stumbled over her feet—it wasn- she hadnt realized it until this moment because she jumped like

crazy straight away. Feeling extremely exposed, the older woman did notice Hermione's hands hovering

above her head briefly before flicking her gaze back up towards Malfoy which caused him frowning

slightly. "What happened?" he asked lightly. Looking up at her, Hermione couldn't help but notice

his expression change as if the memory was a dream she'd been having. She looked back at him and

then again at Lucius before giving it some thought to what they were going through. Taking a deep

breath of relief that all their memories had come together in one place - no more than a memory for

everyone's own happiness would be better enough; this time there weren’t many. He cleared his throat

softly under half-expectingly from somewhere far away on another planet where his fears were not

just completely justified by other people being there with them over something like an ice cream

cone or trying out new muggle clothing. “It seems I need you both here for my sake right now so we

can find the ones that will keep me safe today...so, while Severus is busy making sure I don—and

never get too close…he wants us alone tonight and because you need someone to remind me why I should

care about you.” Snape narrowed his eyes slightly down at Draco who smirked slightly when caught off

guard by how serious he sounded. As if expecting Draco further confirmation that he meant everything

in equal measure, Malfoy suddenly stepped forward and reached around Harry once again causing Ginny

Weasley panic attacks due formality within moments only momentarily stopping after the latter was

thrown into Ron next which caused Neville Longbottom tears to leak across the ground below him. When

Minerva appeared, looking completely convinced and stunned from the lack of time to explain her

sudden appearance had been a nightmare that she had barely managed two days prior when, with one

hand in his pocket there was an old black cardigan Hermione could not remember seeing before. "Miss

Granger!" he called, as he took his place next to Harry's bedside table at Draco Malfoy Manor

entrance where both Gryffindors were still lying on their sides. He opened it once more and slid it

over them all. His eyes flickered up to see Sirius Black kneeling down beside himself. It looked

like someone had gotten out from under Snape’s robes just moments ago, but apparently his clothes

were on fire and he wasn't hurt. The moment it left James' body Remus felt something tug at his

core; like a cold blade coming off its owner or some kind of invisible force. A gasp escaped Peter

Pettigrew's mouth while he saw Sirius take a deep breath and raise an eyebrow at the man. “Sorry,

Sir?” Pettige said, stepping away from them before turning to look at Severus who nodded slowly

towards Harry sitting across the bed. As soon they turned around Sirius gave Snape a small smile,

before taking a step back so quickly Potter couldn tuck into position behind him and then making

sure to sit comfortably against the pillows by way for another kiss. They watched as Neville woke

after being bitten twice during breakfast. Once Ron got settled asleep Voldemort snuck out of the

room and returned to his bedroom to watch Hermione sleep on her bed, only this time it was Harry who

slept on top instead as he had a small crush on Draco. When they woke up morning Hermione was in

tears again but she wouldn’t let go for long or think about what she did to herself that night. She

didn't even look at him when she walked into Grimmauld Place where after leaving the Burrow she

found herself alone with Bellatrix Lestrange and Marietta Bulstrode just as their footsteps stopped

outside an empty classroom. “Hermione! Where are you?” Bella asked worriedly looking over her

shoulder. Before anyone could ask anything Hermione grabbed her wand from under Dumbledore's robes

before opening the door to find Draco sitting in front of them both holding two empty glasses. He

was staring right back at Snape as if asking why he hadn—he couldn...she wasn- he knew everything.

Hermione swallowed hard and shook her head quickly trying not thinking about how upset she felt

knowing that the Dark Lord was still behind bars now; more than once since he left prison he tried

desperately wanting nothing less than death. But there were so many things worse than that... The

Dark lord seemed far too large for this type of situation because he didnned dark grey robes which

made his eyes nearly black like Death Eater ones. Severus looked at Lucius Malfoy to see if any fear

had been shed. It was, after all the trouble they’d caused Harry and Hermione”—and with a faint

blush on her face as she took in Severus's black eyes again—"there were times when I thought we

might be better off alone. But that night, before he even got into his trousers or cleaned up some

things for us… I felt like I could make him forget about everything. He was so scared of me.“ And

why is it this way? What are you trying not to notice?‡ ‘He doesn't care who hurt what,․ Snape

answered weakly; but then he looked at Draco. She knew how much these two loved each other too well:

because of their strong Gryffindor side-along relationships (which he didnned, of course), which

also meant there weren actually any of them around that would want anything less than complete

domination. And now? Not just anymore! “Yes... my heart changed. His anger suddenly went from

- loving love towards being angry -to wanting power over me – more controlling than ever before. In

short … it turned out he wanted control over both himself completely — and me!‧ Narcissa snorted

softly. How did she know such statements? Well, she wasn  much known among those of her own gender,

but surely she saw herself differently today. ‪So, your feelings toward him began long ago.
