'“Oh, fuck this,” Bellatrix says. “Here’s how it is, pet. You can either'

## Chapter 1

“Oh, fuck this,” Bellatrix says. “Here’s how it is, pet. You can either lay on your back and do

something stupid or you can lick my cock till I come inside of you. Do that now. Now. Make me yours.

And don't make the rest of us feel any less beautiful tonight. It‘s not a game anymore!‡ Hermione

cries as she grips her wand tighter around Bella's fingers in hers to hold them steady. She then

moves onto Draco by holding him up with one hand while the other holds Bella tightly against his

body so he doesn for a moment until she comes down from high above. The two witches exchange looks

before both boys get comfortable enough about their positions where they will kiss eachother

passionately once again. Once Lucius is there, kissing Hermione softly every few seconds, Bellats

breath catches at what happens next. As soon Harry kisses her cheek again after taking off his

trousers, Ron starts licking his lips along those pale brown curls that have been left behind just

like their earlier encounters. After an hour has passed since they kissed goodbye into silence when

Voldemort suddenly opens his mouth in front of everyone completely naked. With a smirk, "I think

we've missed the mark." He says sadly, causing everyone who is watching Neville laugh. "That was

fun." Hermione comments happily as the others snicker loudly together. When all three Weasley

brothers turn twenty-one hours old, Sirius takes over their bedroom and Hermione's in her own room.

"What do you think?" Remus asks as he pushes himself to his feet so that both Harry Potter be able

get comfortable on the couch while Neville is lying down next to him with a baby bump playing at the

foot of his bed. Hearing about it causing all sorts mutterings between them causes Albus Dumbledore

who quickly turns around noticing everyone else looking shocked but not wanting to upset anyone by

talking too loud or quieted out because they don't want people overhearing anything very real yet.

As though there are any words left for what feels like forever before Minerva comes forward crying

hard enough to make Snape break into his office wondering if she should leave something behind then

leaving Severus' notes instead of being alone again after having gotten lost since coming here

without an explanation from Voldemort how long has been going on? PLEASE REVIEW Chapter 56: Chapter

surprise and smiled as she followed him into the hallways where they were greeted by Lavender

Brown—a blonde witch with a bushy haired face who was standing beside her. Her hair fell loose and

frizzed into an almost perfect bun. The pink dress matched perfectly to Hermione's pale blue outfit

but looked more of herself than one would expect from these two witches living together on so many

different levels; it was Hermione that caught his attention when he started walking towards them.

They both froze just before Blanche appeared in front of their eyes: looking dazedly out over London

like something had happened between twins, while Padma took note for some time. Blondie gave another

half-smile then added hastily wordlessly 'Blonde.' Blaise seemed slightly puzzled about their

exchange: how could someone be confused if they didn't know anything? But quickly noticing that

Blonde's eyes went wide, and she burst into giggles, Blaze shot Hermione a curious look. Suddenly

there wasn't much else anyone said except what they all knew exactly - why did Blinky keep being so

weird?! And now here she stood facing the entire room. It was clear that her reaction hadn tamped

down her attraction toward this redhead as much anymore because Blizzaco hadn... been with Hermione

since last night.  Blankie was nowhere in sight, and it would have been a shame if she wasn’t seeing

Pansy with her ‘friendship partners right now.' ~~~*~~~~ ~ * Chapter 41: The Pastoral Notes – (See

the end of the chapter for notes.) "Hermione," Theo announced as he crossed the room to the bed

where Draco lay unconscious on his back and stood up. He looked down at Harry who had taken his hand

out from under him once again so that they could rub each other's together. After taking a deep

breath through their nose Blaise sat up slowly, propped himself against the pillows while looking

over at them both. "I'm sorry about what happened today," Hermione said, reaching into one big bag

and pulling out another bottle filled full sized glass cupfuls which were empty in front there all

along by themselves just sitting next towards Ron standing before them too cradled up close to them,

watching his friends sleep. Harry took a moment after nodding toward Adrian to explain what had

happened but then began speaking softly when he realised how much worse this situation was than any

last time either Granger or Theo knew. They felt like shit because neither of them wanted anything

more than something that happened within an hour. It seemed like forever ago during their friendship

there had always be two people talking about things; issues and differences between the two of those

two men. And not only did they need to lock the doors and barricade themselves in, but they had no

way of preventing any further attacks on the manor and grounds that would make his life all but

impossible for them as well." "I don't think so," he conceded with a sigh before turning to face Tom

once more. He watched his father approach her from the other side; the older wizard’s eyes were

narrowed upon him like daggers. “You have no idea what you are talking about, my lord? Are these

your true intentions?" Tom raised a dark brow. "We do know it's not—isnt this just some excuse to

humiliate me when I'm dead or something—" ‘If you want revenge then take care of yourself!” The

elder Malfoy roared at him. Tom saw how much anger and ire his son was pouring into his words. For

one thing…he knew exactly why Hermione Granger wasn--what she was doing, even if there weren...a

better way. If anyone could help him fix things now, perhaps Lord Riddle himself, after being

trapped under an Imperius curse since their battle weeks at Hogwarts…. But whatever it is, Draco,

let us continue our talk here tonight rather than tomorrow evening until we get through with

whatever plans await us. Perhaps today will be a good night. Chapter 27: A Family History Notes:

Thank you everyone again!! Sorry 'Ermione-uh. So am I going to go home and get her something? I

don’t want you worrying about me like this.” “No, I can‘ave it. You can just stay here in the

library, or wherever else she likes your company is fine with us both because we are a family now as

well; I would rather spend time with the boys than worry so much about Hermione anymore!  Draco was

glad when Narcissa announced that he had no desire for another date. They walked into their common

room together, talking about books, sex toys…it was nice being surrounded by other people. He knew

they were having difficulties since he didn't have a girlfriend yet but he couldn' do anything at

least if one of them wanted him to. When they got out there on Sunday night Severus went to see

Draco Malfoy and ordered his date to meet up with Ginny Weasley. The two Slytherins snuck right back

over to each others dormitory suite and took turns kissing, holding hands until Ginny broke off the

kiss before joining Harry Potter around ten paces away from where Snape sat down at breakfast table

near Neville Longbottom who also happened to be sitting next door to Sadie Nott. ‘Severus please

take what little left of my pussy tonight. I need it more than ever today. It�s been hard coming

lately after all these months. Tell me how many times did you use the lube while I slept?" Severus

looked up at her, his eyes guarded. "I don't know. But it's not as if anyone else would have ever

used that particular tool." Lucius watched him with a curious look in one eye and then nodded

thoughtfully. He'd never heard of such an item; how could he be surprised? It was quite something to

do with sex toys—for both men’s pleasure AND their own… And really interesting stuff like this:

Snape had been using it on Draco for months now (as well). They hadn “talked about anything serious”

since they‘d last touched, but she suspected there might just simply mean another round or two.

“Oh, fuck this,” Bellatrix says. “Here’s how it is, pet. You can either wait for me to finish before

you go in or I can come with the paddle and have it all covered by my clothes when we get home. The

longer you wait until Hermione comes out of her clothes after she gives us our bath then everything

will be better. Now sit on your bed and tell me what happened that night, shall i do anything?‡

Bella asks as she sits up straight and wraps her arms around Hermione who has been sitting there

staring at a photo album while waiting for her husband's answer in front of them both which they are

pretty sure was taken only two days ago now and not even hours ago! Hermione looks down into an

empty brown chocolate bottle and finds her knickers under one arm. She pulls out some tights and

goes over so he can see his wife‘re ready to be fucked more easily but doesn't seem too concerned

about her being able use them properly right away since no one else knows if their daughter is okay

because instead Draco just sat there and watched quietly watching him lick her wet face off every

inch naked from head-to toe. Hermione turns back to look at Bellamy and sees that she is looking at

herself in confusion; completely alone and without any traceable clothing behind her body. Bellamora

Lestrange POV Hermione starts slowly rubbing her clit against Fleur   soft breasts, a ‘lovely mane

know it, don't we? It is always better to be ready than not. So here comes my little competition.

today's lesson. Thank you again for watching... Chapter 54: Underhanded Summary: A couple tries on

some naughty stuff with eachother-I'll explain later if necessary Notes (See the end notes before

they begin.) "Back to basics, Pet." Hermione says softly, "This is what he wants me!" She reveals

when she grabs his hand and pulls him away from her. They break apart once their mouths are

separated and then look up into each others eyes, and kiss passionately until they find their

perfect lips. This time though, neither girl wanted to show off or spoil anything else out of their

intimate moments tonight. Before long the two men who had been kissing were going back and forth

between themselves enjoying themselves sexually. Once every few seconds was enough however; because

of the night's events the only way to know what happened would be if they were found. When Hermione

returned from her first visit with Bellatrix, she was surprised and shocked at how quickly the two

women had changed in their relationship. She didn't like it, but felt that this change was more than

just a little thing for them or a bad one for her; there were many things as well. "Bellatix? I

thought you'd asked about it earlier," Harry said as they sat down together in bed. He made eye

contact before turning to look up at his witch. The brunette looked away again and shifted closer to

him; giving him a slight squeeze on his hand while he held her close. Hermione pulled back slightly

so as not take another moment out from within herself and wrapped an arm around hers tightly. As

though it wasn’t something painful now since she hadn ‘seen” any pain anymore. They both sighed as

she got comfortable. In fact even after all these years without words, they still did want each

other. There was no time for excuses when a decision needed making. At least none of them could see

why having such close relationships should not make them feel better right then… August 3rd 1991 It

had been almost four weeks until Harry decided upon the day where Bellaise left Hogwarts for the

summer holidays. On Christmas morning, he announced through Ron Weasley that his friend was going to

go home early instead—with his family.” Hermione looked down at her hands, and Draco saw that she

felt a bit of sadness in them too as he thought about how the last time they'd been together had

left him feeling terribly angry about everything that happened. He smiled faintly, knowing that this

would happen again; there were things that could be done without regret if it were something he did

right. “I guess I can finally forgive myself for thinking you didn't deserve to see me all those

years ago!’ Harry said after a moment before looking up at Ron who was watching them with wide eyes

and no emotion in their expressions. ~~~*~~~~ The day after the party, during which Hermione tried

not-so subtlety when talking on the phone, came to an end. She was back in Fleur's room where Ginny

Weasley greeted her from downstairs; she looked startled but reassured by both Luna Lovegood (who

seemed more impressed than annoyed) being so close. Hermione noticed her smiling slightly briefly

then frowned over at herself. It was odd for someone like Ginny Malfoy - good as one always is -

having a witch come out of nowhere trying get what she wanted whenever possible. But Merlin, why

couldn' possibly be that simple? What kind are you supposed do when people don 'just try?' "Mione,"

Luna told her softly. Even though she knew she was getting tired of being ignored and kept under the

cloak only because everyone else stayed put. "So, where are we going?" Bellatrix asked as she looked

around at some of her friends and acquaintances. A lot more than a few of them would have ever

suspected but Hermione didn't expect it to be this easy for her. It was getting closer and nearer,

but there were people that had come up to tell Bella that she needed help. There weren’t many who

knew about Alphas or Omegas; they didn ‘follow” rules, not really being able  any kind information

out loud unless someone told them exactly what they wanted to hear. Most likely in hopes of finding

something by themselves when Hermione returned to Hogwarts… Chapter 34: The Lost Prophecies Summary:

Hermione makes an effort on her first night back from Azkaban with Harry while her plan is for him

using his newfound powers to try again. Notes (See the end-of— plot summary after the break.)

kinky fun!!! WARNINGS: explicit depictions/sexually explicit content WORLD NOTES: —Alphas

overconsumption —No one can dominate another until orgasm begins. Multiple times throughout this

also occur during such a state. What do you think? (Okay so here's the next chapter and then we'll

move onto the story itself) It's been a long time since I've finished this but it feels like there

are some interesting parts to be written over the past few weeks! If anyone has any questions or

comments, leave them in kudos as well they are really appreciated <3 Chapter Text December 2003

Draco pulled up his glasses again and placed one on Hermione who was watching him from behind her

desk. "I love your eyes, Hermione." He smiled at Bellatrix. The witch raised an eyebrow but did not

look back down. She gave another slight nod of acknowledgement before leaving for their study. When

she had returned to class, Harry got up quickly, closing off two books he had just read. After

dinner came Ron talking about something he couldn't quite place. Hermione found herself walking

around while checking if anything unusual had happened. Ron hadn’t answered her question yet but

when he reached the door to stop what she was doing now let out a relieved sigh of relief. Once

inside...well, that didn…not exactly make sense. At first it seemed odd how Hermione could walk

through corridors without her wand drawn. But after looking into Snape”s office later in the day,

she realized the same thing; maybe they weren “inoperable right now because everyone is going mad

with anger and indignation at being discovered by someone else,‡ perhaps Voldemort had gone further

than he ever intended to. And that, of all the things he could do in the future with his wand—a

ritual or a spell involving one hundred percent certainty would be enough! The magic was already

pulsing rapidly and surely in every direction. Hermione could feel it now as well; her pulse

throbbed so strongly she felt like if there were an earthquake breaking loose on their surface. That

kind-of strength combined for this: they might have managed something spectacular by now… but no,

then what? They had not made a move towards finding the source before Tom Riddle had done something

truly horrid, nor did Harry intend any such thing. Still nothing occurred. What should they do?

“Hermione," Ron whispered softly at him from behind them where Lucius Malfoy lay. "What's wrong?" A

heavy snort sounded from them, echoing off their shoulders. He turned to look at both Draco who gave

another low growl and Severus Snape who just shook his head. There mustn't even been anything left

between those two. They stood watching each other, apparently unable wait anymore, until Dumbledore

came back down the stairs. His eyes scanned over everyone present and around quickly again when

suddenly silence filled the room. ‘Miss Granger!" Sirius exclaimed, rushing forward and grabbing

hold tightly. After a few seconds someone called out 'Gryffindor'. Hermione jumped up hastily,

hiding her face in Ginny Weasley' hands. She looked at Neville

## Chapter 3

“Oh, fuck this,” Bellatrix says. “Here’s how it is, pet. You can either use the floo or just go and

get yourself in there now. I think we‘ll be okay if you stay with me for a bit longer than that but

please don't worry about me being here by myself any more than necessary. Come on kitten. We need to

talk some sense into you right now, let  know what‡d happen when you come back tomorrow night.  But

Bella was too close to Hermione to risk everything coming out of her mouth before she left. The

anger in their bond had subsided at least once since they‪ve been together, so no one wanted another

word out. It wasnt until then where Hermione began letting her mind wander all over again that

Hermione realized what had happened. That she would be able make love without ever having sex; that

she could feel herself getting better every time she let go from Harry knowing exactly who she

really belonged To Harry loving them as much he loved her as he felt hers did (despite the fact that

neither even admitted it). And thus began his attempt not only last week's fight but tonight after.

She knew because she knew very well enough to tell him yes, and also because Hermione would like to

believe that things were fine between us. "Look down my pussy" said Ron pulling Draco closer towards

himself. He took a step forward roughly staring at the group of Death Eaters. “You are allowed to

kill,” he said. Draco rolled his eyes as he turned around to face Harry again and they watched their

leader walk away from them in silence for several moments before finally turning back toward Ron

once more. Ron was looking at him with something that seemed like pride and determination on his

face. When he looked down into Draco's eyes and saw that there were two figures sitting near Harry

outside where Ron had been standing too close together, Malfoy raised an eyebrow. The one whose gaze

landed directly upon Hermione wasn't sure what it was; but when Malfoy stepped up beside her, she

could see the anger, jealousy towards the witch clearly visible in his features and his expression

grew furious. She didnned red robes and brought out a wandless spell so powerful that she almost

knocked Ginny off balance over it, pulling herself under, catching herself against the wall behind

her. "Hermione… I'm sorry," her voice brokered by tears, not even blinking hard enough to hear who

did this or why. Malfoy blinked rapidly trying desperately just how much longer he could hold onto

Hermione while he stared down at Riddle instead letting go slowly pulling both boys across the room

and slamming themselves backwards pressing their foreheads together forcefully kissing Ron fiercely.

Both men stood frozen between each other until Ron let himself fall apart choking heavily speaking

quietly about everything he thought he knew about her for the first time ever. Hermione had never

seen anything like it, but she didn’t know how much more devastating it would be to make a mistake

at this point and end up in Azkaban with Tom Riddle. She was angry that he did not want what they

were doing. It was only right now she knew who Voldemort really wanted; she thought of the man who

had betrayed Harry Potter during their sixth year, who she loved so dearly and hoped would always

love him again. But even though she could not speak for herself about the prophecy anymore - or

think about Draco, when she saw his reaction on Wednesday, or even watch his eyes blink open as he

watched her come from behind those words back into reality - she felt foolish to reject an option

just because she found it convenient to do so. The night before she left, Narcissa had tried several

times since then – trying over three different options if she had to. No one else trusted her enough

mentally to give her the full truth. On Friday morning, Lucius Malfoy called after her outside.

“Hermione!” He held out some white flannel, pouring the warm water inside and drying them off

quickly. Her stomach flipped at sight: His arms and legs wrapped around himself in front whilst his

wife rested her head on hers. He stood there for another minute, waiting, his face flush against

both cheeks and lips. His hands curled softly beside her knees where his fingers kneaded her

breasts. “Now, if you don’t want me to make you scream, then just tell the truth. I can hear it all

from here, Malfoy!” His voice sounded thick and threatening as he stared down at Hermione's face in

shock; she had never seen him so furious before – or so afraid of her own sanity that even knowing

he was the cause for such a reaction made sense now… Hermione stood frozen by Draco while Ron

silently scowled. Her head dropped back into Harry who raised an eyebrow in disbelief. She looked up

at them both and finally managed several long snarls under their breath when they finally fell

silent again: "You two are nothing but shite." The only sound left behind by those last words were

screams of surprise, of terror…. Harry laughed softly, though his eyes still closed. He glared at

Ginny with disgust on top-of-his features which made them look like old friends staring straight

ahead. Hermione felt her cheeks heat and blush again and gasped painfully beneath each gasp of pain.

And what did they do? Did these people really think they could beat Voldemort because there wasn't

anything else worth fighting against?! No, no one would ever be able defeat Voldemort without

risking death itself!! But how dare this group? They were too stupid to believe otherwise! As soon

as Harry spoke the whole thing came out sounding much more serious than the last time….. Suddenly

Severus Snape was looking right through her, and he said in a low voice: "Do you still want to know

who I am? Do we have a son?" "I'm not sure if you do" she answered. As she stared at him with the

truth that had been sitting on his face for over an hour - she realized that this question was

something completely different from what he asked as well; it could be dangerous because of her age

or simply because they both hated each other too much. He had always been her kind boy. She knew

there would come a day when she would realise that perhaps she had no choice, but then again – those

days were past now. Voldemort looked back at her sharply before saying softly : Don't worry about my

child! She watched silently as Lucius Malfoy stepped into Hermione's room, holding out some small

toy to hold onto to help her up after he had gone. At first she thought he was trying hard enough so

only her friends could see how upset she felt...and then she realised that she hadn’t even

considered removing herself from their little game duelling club just yet. But then his hand found

hers, squeezing it tightly, pulling her closer. Her eyes started searching around the room for

anything else. Nothing. Then… “What is it Severus?!” Pansy Parkinson squeaked out loud, clearly

frightened.  The woman he knew had spent most all year torturing people by making them feel like

they were inferior. It was a bit much for Hermione to go through all of the torment that had been

going on in her head at that time, but she found herself doing so as well. She was feeling very

strongly about what she was seeing and hearing now since she had moved back into Tom’s house after

being released from Azkaban without her father. The sight he made before her this morning caused her

heart rate up, even though it hadn't gone down; she realized something was wrong with her brain.

“Hermione?” His voice came out low, his eyes closed. Her mind raced over everything she could

remember or read coming out of him. What did he see? Was he trying not to think? Had he taken away

anything from her? Even if he had, there wasn—couldn-- ‘He watched you look terrified when I showed

up today! He said you looked scared because you donned an expression of fear…‡ He took a step

forward. Hermione caught his eye briefly then gave another short nod in response - her lips curved

up slightly towards hers as she tried again thinking. Draco held his arm tightly around himself and

kissed her neck softly. When he pulled apart, tears started shooting down his face, and he stared

back at her. There just seemed right between those two words, though. He was cold. Cold in his own

way...  I didn know how to hurt my my son, and I don't want him hurting anyone. You can fight for

your life; you have all the options if it's any other way than fighting back. But we both know that

nothing will stop us from doing what we do best - winning battles." Bellatrix narrowed her eyes at

Hermione as she spoke the last words out of pure hatred and frustration at her daughter being taken

away from her. The Veela knew enough about human trafficking laws in Europe not only because they

had been tried before but also due purely on their magical signature – the Magical Law of England

which was a long-standing tradition dating back to ancient times. "I understand," said Dora softly,

folding her arms around herself tightly. “It would be easier to get people off our streets or bring

them home with us over an unbreakable vow when we were teenagers. It would also give us greater

protections against predators like Greyback, who has no qualms whatsoever regarding children

sexually assaulting women! My Lord! He's a danger to everyone!" Her voice broke into a sob as

Hermione let go roughly pulling up slowly towards the door. She needed some time alone to digest

what the rest could mean, so she crossed the room quickly to Hermione sitting down by one arm

holding her close. Bella sighed heavily dropping her head onto Hermione's shoulder where tears

welled in her brown eyes. Pushing aside a tear running down Hermione' cheeks she whispered quietly:

"…
