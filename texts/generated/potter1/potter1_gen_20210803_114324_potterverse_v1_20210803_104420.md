'Hermione knew the curse, but she didn’t feel that it was a valid one'

## Chapter 1

Hermione knew the curse, but she didn’t feel that it was a valid one. She couldn't deny he had made

her do something awful and probably killed someone during their time together and she wasn—I

suppose—sorry about that too? She didn-she just felt bad for letting him in on his secret so much of

what happened after they had arrived at Grimmauld was off limits to Hermione because the pain

wasn…wrong! And now she thought, how wrong were you if he saw us here alone? If I hadn ‘moved”,

maybe I could have found them somewhere else; maybe we could be with each other instead...so she

started talking again. When they returned, Draco looked confused. He tried not looking suspicious at

all as he sat down next Ron who spoke up, "I think we should go." Hermione nodded once. They talked

for an hour or so before finally deciding themselves that whatever she told herself would be better

than nothing and then decided no more to tell anyone without permission either. It was almost eleven

o'clock when Draco pulled out another piece from behind Harry's back where there must've been four

pieces inside. The Dark Mark appeared, like two golden ones, glinting orange, as though ready by

itself. But Hermione wasnd know anything about this mark, not even knowing how old it really needed

being on its own. "That," Theo said cautiously. His eyes widened slightly seeing it glow green, blue

sparks shooting through the mist. “What?” Tom asked with an amused grin on his face as he slowly

stepped forward and pressed a silencing charm to prevent any possible explosions from occurring.

When the fire was extinguished, Hermione leaned over to inspect the sight of her daughter in bright

red light shining brightly off some sort contraption. It looked exactly like this: two children

holding each other's arms while their eyes burned. The child looked just perfect, almost human

looking. She was wearing only black clothes which were all lined up neatly against one another on

either side for easy visibility when they were standing directly behind the other person who had

been holding them. And she looked even more beautiful now, no longer so skinny but still very tall.

Her hair hung down perfectly, though not quite falling out due to that part; instead reaching back

into its place where Gryffindor Hufflepuff girl could see it. That part caught attention too,

because both girls were looking at her curiously, and then Bellatrix turned around quickly, her

expression dangerous without being overly stern. He shook his head slightly before turning away to

look at the situation again – clearly avoiding looking between the children. Still far away, perhaps

there was something else about her appearance that made him wonder if he would be able gain access

or control those few minutes later. Maybe… maybe I should get rid of my own books! Chapter 10 Notes:

Hello everyone! This is really good news indeed, and I am so glad to have you all joining me on this

wonderful journey. As a thank you for your continued support of the FFN we are going into

hibernation because it means that every new chapter will be free from any pesky bugs or errors (as

well as some other minor changes). If there are anything specific in particular that needs to go

away please let us know via our discord server: tsunderexpert dot com Chapter 27 Notes: (See the end

notes at the bottom.) Chapter Text "And here's the part about Harry." Ron says with a smile. A few

minutes later Neville picks up his robes from where they were discarded over the table and starts to

remove them off again; but before he can do something more than open them another hand comes up

behind him holding his wand. The older wizard gasps when he sees Harry and walks forward taking out

his right hand and pulling back slightly looking down upon it with an expression which belies his

fear of Harry being caught. "Well then what?" Harry asks surprised by the looks of surprise around

him as even though he doesn't believe anyone else believes him Sirius just takes one look at Harry

before grabbing both Harry’s left hand from under Ron who just gives it a quick squeeze while giving

a nod towards Harry. Moving quickly Hermione moves her hands backwards along Harry's arm until she

finds his middle finger resting on top next to his head as if trying not only find the source of her

rage, but also get at him. She didn’t know how he would react with a stranger—but she knew that it

was wrong and that he couldn't just abandon the girl without a fight or anything like this happening

again in their lives for fear someone else might see them differently. Hermione stared at Malfoy

before glancing down at Harry who still wasn “silenced by Occlumency? You” Again Ron looked offended

and Hermione saw tears coming to Draco's eyes. When they reached Neville there were gasps and moans

of surprise. Harry groaned and gave up on looking at anyone, instead focused solely upon avoiding

eye contact between himself; Harry turned back to look at Lucius whose face had become

expressionless. There seemed nothing to do except stare back at Snape and then back out onto Remus

when everything went black, so Severus reluctantly led all three of them over towards where Dean

stood with Scorpius' limp body wrapped around him tightly against theirs while Professor McGonagall

carefully laid away his body until his clothes cleared from view. ‘What happened?!‘ Sirius asked

angrily. He struggled against every single piece attempting desperately unbuttoning his shirt which

caused Harry stiffen slightly thinking about how much he wanted revenge through pain alone and how

very angry he felt right now. Luckily Hermione found herself kneeling beside Bellatrix, she pulled

her wand slowly and held it above their heads until she felt another tear slip from her eye. “He’s

safe, Hermione! He—he's been here for hours and he came back with no trace of us!” The pain in the

corner broke again, and Hermione had to blink several times to clear it away before letting go off

his hand as though someone were dragging him through a hole into an abandoned building without any

knowledge or control over them at all; the same feeling that had haunted Ginny since first seeing

her dead father last year. "I have to tell you," Draco continued bitterly after a moment while

Severus tried valiantly not mutter out loud so they could both listen properly (as if there was

anything more important than having Potter around). His expression conveyed nothing but worry about

himself because his godfather still didn't know how much longer he could hold on to the memory of

those four children forever attached together.  And then Snape finally spoke. A heavy sigh broke

free, startling everyone else from sight.    "We have time now." Notes: This story is part-written

by TBC and will be released within days of its official release. I'm just glad my partner Kole and

editor Katie are able enough behind closed doors to get this book published when I can spare them

some time. Thank you very much for your ongoing support ❤︎ Chapter 23: Flashback 12 Summary: Minerva

has just finished preparing breakfast lunchtime dinner plans ahead of schedule duelling students?”

Ron asks as he puts down his quill and sits across from Hermione. “I don't know why I should, but

you did this for me! You promised us that we would be together forever and with no one else in the

world to see it through. But now here we are today, three years after your birthdays – more than

ever before! And look how things have changed since then… Merlin help me if Harry is being a dick

about it or not. He didn- he just has so much love on my face right now, isn't he?" Hermione says,

her voice quiet so she can hear him. She doesnned the last button to her hair, it was only half

pulled back by Theo's. "Harry said what happened between us," Draco whispers into hers, "And all

day." He says sadly, tears running freely up her cheeks again when they start crying. For everyone

involved Hermione knows everything will be okay because there is nothing anyone could do except give

their word once people realise who had done something wrong; even Neville knew where exactly someone

might go next. The moment they wake at Grimmauld Place an empty hallways are formed around them,

causing chaos and noise, creating confusion. They haven taunted each other during the first few days

of school, until Minerva told them both two weeks ago: there was no way Professor McGonagall

wouldnnther be able keep anything going any longer, so he left to go take a shower. Harry stayed

with Draco until the sun started up and then went back downstairs to get dressed before heading

upstairs to bed. Chapter 42: A Bit More Summary: I know what you're thinking! But please don't worry

about me being too slow when it comes time for my next story!! Also...I hope that this chapter

contains some action from Hermione/Draco (it's pretty hot but not in heat). Let me give you an

example of how she feels now as well. So much fun!!! Love xoxo Notes: This one is super long already

because I've been busy writing these chapters :) Enjoy? Chapter Text It was almost nine am on

Thursday evening and they were all gathered at Malfoy Manor home having dinner ready since Ginny had

missed her meeting with Kingsley after his arrival while Molly and Arthur were out shopping

together. They walked down the hall and paused outside the door where Draco could see the house-

elves, which meant something. He stepped inside and found himself looking around frantically

wondering if Hermione would be there or just sitting quietly listening to them talking. "What are we

doing here?" Ron asked once they entered the room. Hermione opened their door and followed him into

another part; behind, sat George Weasley who stood beside Luna Bulstrode by herself playing cards

without even trying – it was weird. The other witch looked angry duelling. She looked both serious

yet shy and happy

## Chapter 2

Hermione knew the curse, but she didn’t feel that it was a valid one. The magic was only a short

term sort of protective. It was almost like trying to remove an element from itself by means other

than creating new molecules and building up old ones for use in more complex projects. She could

only imagine how much time she had invested into this project over the past few months. “Can I help

you? Can we not just go home?” Draco asked as he made his way towards her. Hermione pulled out two

books with him on potions ingredients which were already hard boiled together onto parchment paper

using charms, scrolls or whatever spell they weren't used at all now would be useful if they needed

extra training since Hermione was still technically her age when these texts came with their own

instructions. When they arrived at Hogwarts, there wasn-not really anything else besides homework to

do aside what felt like hours spent under heavy rain and all sorts kind lighting spells. Draco took

her hand and helped her sit down so that he could lean back against each sideboard while resting his

head on hers again before laying down next to them on either end facing the wall. His hands moved

slowly along between both girls as his lips brushed over every part even though she seemed reluctant

because it wouldn' normally take longer than necessary to get comfortable after being kissed without

having to pull away completely sometimes. With careful touches, he started pulling off her shirt

causing her legs slightly bumping beneath him. He paused gently, allowing her to get a better look

at his face. “It’s all right? It was pretty intense.” She nodded slowly and placed her hands on the

back of Draco's neck as she began rubbing her fingers along it with one finger until he felt himself

fall into complete calmness again just before falling onto top-level flight level. Her eyes widened

in surprise when Hermione immediately lifted up to look down at them both staring back at each other

blankly for another two seconds then they all stared back up at Ron who had taken his hand off Harry

Potter entirely without hesitation or question. Hermione didn't need any more reminders that Harry

could have made an excellent leader; she already knew this. Ron started to smile sheepishly over at

her but instead took a deep breath and moved towards her feet so fast that he looked like some kind

jackass. She found herself shaking completely from the cold air surrounding her, as well knowing

exactly what to do next. "Ron." They all turned their heads toward the doorway and waited while

Hermione opened the door behind Harry inside Hogwarts following closely followed by Snape taking her

place. As soon Bellatrix came out of hiding she was immediately pushed aside causing Harry suddenly

wincing under whatever force was being thrown at him and nearly running away through the castle

doors which only caused her own rage even further surging forward. The moment she saw him she raised

her wand and pointed it at every single person in sight. Hermione was surprised to see that Ron had

been hit with a curse, but she could only assume he hadn’t even blinked his eyes out of fear of

being knocked down by the spell itself! As she watched Harry walk back to where they were standing,

her heart sped up ever so slightly as she thought about what she would do if she tried anything. She

felt the pain from each strike coming from behind and knew that when it got to them both their magic

was going crazy under control right now – all three wizards were falling over one another and she

knew there must be something wrong; an object crashing into their side or someone else trying hard

enough to get him away… The sounds sounded again, and then they went still. Harry pulled Ron's cloak

tighter around him and said softly: “We don't have time for this here. We have more important things

to worry than Harry Potter dying on our hands. Let”s just go find Harry and move forward…. Chapter

21: Part 1 Notes: (See the end-of chapter notes) Chapter Text "I know you love me, I know," Ron

whispered as he reached towards Ginny Weasley, who stood beside him as well sitting on either

armchair. "Hermione, please." He turned and looked at the man who was holding her tightly, his gaze

dark, cold..  "You need us to work together until we are ready…" "It wonll be a while, after all,"

Draco promised. "I'll see you tomorrow." "And then I'll have to make an appointment with the healer

before-" He stopped short as he watched his son get up and leave the room at once. He didn't know

what was going on between them in that moment but knew they had no idea it would be anything more

than their little game plan. Chapter 9: Sticking Together Summary The bookworm finally found her

voice when she opened up to him again. She wanted so badly for everything he had done for her. Draco

was always willing or able if needed; but this time around...he just wasn’t holding back. And

despite their differences—their love stories were still something of hers even though the situation

changed every few days. Notes:- One last thing - Hermione is not pregnant! I'm glad everyone has

agreed to let me finish writing my next two chapters- thanks to Kyonomiko (miss ky) for pointing out

the missing section about Draco's mother/parents and who knows how many other issues came up during

those last couple weeks because she seems very happy today..and by now, Kudos will come in handy!!

Chapter Text Ron was sitting outside the Slytherin common room watching his friends play Quidditch

practice near Ginny Weasley‘s house. His mind wandered over each member taking notes from various

students' homework assignments being held throughout class where Harry Potter, Sirius Black and

Albus Dumbledore are. “Mione?” Ginny asks as she sits down on the edge of her bed while Neville is

in a corner with Luna Lovegood and Seamus Finnigan. There isn't much time for words right now

Hermione just stands up to hug Fleur who is shaking so hard that even when she looks at her daughter

she can barely make out what it's saying. After all this time Hermione has been okay, but nothing

ever feels like normal again because everything seems to go wrong by the second they get back home

from school or dinner break; there are no answers here nor there either. "I think I'll see you

tomorrow." She says before heading over to her dormitory after work leaving them alone together

until Wednesday night So glad we got our homework done! Notes: Want some stories about how witches

were treated during their OWLs/Owls classes Chapter 11: The Darkest Days Summary: Hermione tries not

look guilty today due notice Malfoy making sure everyone knows he did something horrible... And then

Ron comes walking into the room yelling his name angrily…. A couple minutes later Hermione walks

through Hagrid's hut crying quietly behind her couch.. Cries louder than usual… Suddenly looking

around once more feeling terrified….. Again realizing why Gryffindor was always such an easy target

Draco pulls himself away without another word towards the door which opens softly enough for him

Toogy to see herself sitting across from Remus, both of them smiling as they watched her. "Oh god,"

she whispered, looking away and making a gesture towards the other girl. She didn't look up at

anyone but Sirius. He was staring down at his daughter with worry on his face. Her eyes were drawn

to the spot where Remulus had punched Tonks in the chest when she'd been crying earlier that night,

not wanting to hurt Harry's feelings for her mate so badly. The fact that he didn’t take it well

made sense given how much time Draco spent with Remiis; after all, Hermione hadn ‘recalled” during

the battle over the year, and even though every single person who had ever spoken about it said it

wasnned out loud against Voldemort, there hadn' been any real questions or apologies sent forth by

either side before their friend came back. There weren'more lies, more lies' written into everything

right now, which meant that if anything happened here, things would get worse than just what

Dumbledore told Potter - unless something really went wrong? As far as being able access to

information like that Hermione didnnt know whether she could be trusted anymore because everyone

knew each others whereabouts! So why did she keep talking?! Forcing himself to calm down completely

while he walked through the castle full force forcing light inside his head seemed to make Granger

almost hyper aware of everything going on around her and thus saw Snape's scar coming up behind him.

"That boy can't possibly live to see the day," Hermione mumbled, looking over to Harry who had his

back turned to Voldemort as if he was a ghost in disguise while staring at Potter with fear on each

of their faces before turning around again so that she could see Snape now standing there alone for

a moment. Harry swallowed hard at this news, not wanting anything more than what he'd just heard

from Severus. He couldn’t believe it; everything they had told Dumbledore about Severus made him

feel like shit. The man had been a known Death Eater all along but hadn “gone” when Dumbledore

learned of Harry being his own son and how he felt towards Severus Malfoy. It was no wonder then why

Potter was acting strangely after hearing them tell Snape? What would Snape do without knowing

something else? Why did he always act strange because everyone knew—he didn-know, anyway! And Draco

was doing really well right now. If they ever got out of here yet… Well that was probably too much

for both of us. Still thinking about what Snape might say next: it was nice having someone to talk

other people into staying somewhere safe until further notice rather than waiting outside for them

or going inside themselves instead?! But I don' think we're done talking anymore either, are you

guys?" Bellatrix asked quietly. She was looking at Bella directly, and she must have seen some kind

expression of panic set upon

## Chapter 3

Hermione knew the curse, but she didn’t feel that it was a valid one. So the only reason why Harry

could find her safe and be with her felt like an act of God. “So you told me I had to marry Draco?”

Hermione asked softly as they walked down another hall together through their dorm room at Grimmauld

Place just before dinner on Friday night when Ron was still sitting in bed curled up against his

mother over what looked more than asleep beside him in front of them after spending some time

reading. He wondered if he should tell her about Bellatrix now. She would know everything. How did

that mean for her? But instead because how do you expect Bellatsimoniality not exist in this world?

And so she decided that she needed someone who wouldn't give away anything or take something from

her without doing whatever was required by law for it — no matter what happened. That was then. The

first day that things were normal again. Not entirely new anymore. They had settled into fine. It

wasn' weird being back here alone, even though they had been getting better grades each week since

school started. There weren'd any real surprises around Christmas. If the three girls hadn-' - she

shook her head, her mind racing as thoughts raced across its surface; there really couldn 'Malfoy'

look like this, maybe different. Her eyes widened, and suddenly panic rose within her chest. What am

I supposed- When she saw Ron and Harry standing in the kitchen, they both froze. Hermione shook her

head. "Ron?" She asked as he took a step forward. He was holding his hand out to stop her from

pushing it away. But he couldn't make an escape. “No…” A small voice said. It sounded familiar yet

Hermione could not tell what it meant. The last thing that came over her mind was Draco waking up at

this moment with no idea of what to do or who he wanted so desperately for as long ago when he’d met

him. A faint smile crept onto Malfoy's face as Harry turned to face her again before she could think

of anything else but this confrontation between them on Sunday night — he was standing right next to

Lucius while Snape stood behind Ginny Weasley; staring directly into their eyes. With all due

respect Severus had never been one hundred percent comfortable either side should anyone try

something like these; however once they were aware enough about each other there wasnt much stopping

them. She forced herself to focus her gaze back down and then looked back up to see Neville sitting

beside Luna Lovegood; just underneath Professor McGonagall sat Dean Thomas (who still watched the

duel). After a pause Miss Granger let loose another growl. At least it was quiet now; thankfully

neither girl dared say anything as tears fell freely falling upon everyone around them from across

class alike which left both girls in shock as quickly following after being caught by a pair of

guards. “What happened?” She asks confused. Neville says nothing, while Harry, Ron and Hermione all

break the silence that is forming between them for once before they both turn to look at each other

curiously. About an hour later Hermione has come back from her meeting with Draco Malfoy and there

are still some things she wants answers about but none are forthcoming so when she finally gets up

enough time she hurries into Snape's office looking around it without getting too excited or

thinking much about what he will be saying because honestly no one knows anymore how bad his

daughter was feeling during their long time together even if Lucius Malfoy did tell him something

very important; since Voldemort would never get over whatever had hurt her feelings towards him ever

again due only weeks ago on Halloween dinner which meant someone knew better than anyone else just

who could do anything – this made sense considering every single person involved saw proof that

Granger wasn't hurting herself worse yet having gone through multiple different potions lab tests

anyway! "It's alright Miss Granger." Severus tells her softly speaking the last part out loud

causing her heart rate slow to increase despite her best efforts to ignore the pain that seems

always growing within her throat where every time he speaks it can seem like he isn taunting you

more often then not… And why does that bother me Mr Potter?" He asks suddenly sounding shocked

hearing everything Lily said coming out almost harshly behind him. Then Snape nods approvingly

taking another sip of his wine, and Draco feels the rush to drink as he is given a taste by Lucius

again—but not before giving it back as one last lick. When all that has been said about her looks

Malfoy turns around and walks towards Hermione’s bed with an almost sad expression on his face.

“Hermione…” He says, glancing over at Severus, who raises his eyebrows in surprise. In response

Harry stands up and sets down his glass. Looking over Hermione sees there are tears in both eyes as

she tries desperately for calm. Hearing a sob Harry turns to look at Ron trying so hard but failing

miserably. Seeing how sad Hermione seems Harry realises that if he gets too far away from this

conversation then he might regret what he did here. As he does Harry notices something else, which

causes Harry's eyes widen slightly when someone touches him, though they don't react very strongly

either way; no matter whether it be Remus or Sirius. Suddenly Hermione can hear Snape whispering

something under their breath while he sits between them. Turning toward him Harry sees the corner

where Remulus hid himself behind and leans forward kissing Hermione passionately, causing her mouth

open wide even more than it already was, before sinking into herself once more. Taking care also

keeping eye contact with Snape Harry kisses Hermione deeply, wanting nothing less than complete

freedom — especially now being able to do things like that without seeing anyone looking after him

instead … And hearing that my wife is sick.” Hermione nodded quickly, her hands falling to the floor

in a silent outpouring of relief. “I didn't see anything except shagging on Friday. It was quite

nice. I hope you enjoyed it. Hermione, have you talked about this with Father? He's just worried… he

thinks we're too immature for each other. Maybe not mature at all, but still very immature! We don-’

‘Daddy said something about Draco getting jealous and hurting his parents before Christmas,  she

looked away sharply, †but what does that mean exactly?! Do you know why Mum was upset or how did

your father do that for months? When Dad started to abuse us during the school year, they brought me

up every summer so that everyone could watch them play together whenever possible. They were both

cruel, even though our mother was an absolute jerk who acted like nothing more than an idiot when

she got into trouble. She tried everything to stop him and made sure that no one ever saw through

his lies and misdirection, which really hurt since those two things are always true. But then Mom

died because of Draco drinking three glasses of wine while sleeping with her friends, and Mother

went to get some help from Draco as well. Daddy spent much time thinking about how bad love can be –

losing loved ones hurts people badly sometimes, especially if someone isnt willing enough to talk

their pain out properly. If you feel like there’s anything that you can do for her, please let me

know and I will start working on it. Chapter 38: The Next Step Summary: Hermione tries desperately

notto kill Voldemort...but once she knows exactly what he plans to do to her next steps are soon

going very wrong. Notes:-(See the end of the chapter for notes.) Chapter Text As Severus walked into

his office with a stack in hand and papers neatly folded over them both had been filled up with so

much more than they could handle. It was odd because after all these years the only person who ever

would be able finally say no or leave him alone was Harry Potter. He looked back up at Draco looking

entirely drained as the older man took in all this information and everything that had happened

between them before Snape had even seen him. "I just want answers," Sirius said before he gestured

towards Professor Dumbledore's desk. They stood quietly together and Harry gave an irritated sigh

when his eyes landed onto something he couldn't quite place. There were a few books that Hagrid kept

tucked away near one corner under piles of paperwork. In the middle lay some kind old paper which he

noticed Ron had written down during class - it wasna hard unless someone else did too - and in front

sat two scrolls from Minerva McGonagall herself sitting down beside Dora Tonks in Transfiguration

classes. She didnned glasses and put on thin little dresses that she had bought for her parents, as

they hadn't seen each other in a while. "I can do magic," Hermione told them. They nodded. The next

day was more pleasant than the rest of their lives at Hogwarts; everyone were happy to see people

like Blaise Zabini, who lived with his parents at Grimmauld Place during term holidays when they did

not have time out from school, or Katie Bell (who had been at one point pregnant), and Nymphadora

Tonks whose mother was a former Death Eater. Fleur felt warmness wash over her once again, but it

wasn’t enough to satisfy all of them, so she made sure they stayed together throughout their first

week. There would be no other parties this weekend since neither they nor anyone else could come

visit any longer. After lunch, before classes began tomorrow morning after class ended, Hermione

walked into her room and turned around to find Ginny sitting in an armchair looking up. When

Hermione looked down, Ginny looked completely lost. “Hey, Weasley! I'm sorry you missed dinner

today. We should go get some sleep.” Ginny waved her hand dismissively. No matter how many times Ron

called her by name, she never really got used too much anymore. For lack-of-reason he found himself

avoiding Ginny because if he talked about her anyway...it would only make things worse. Harry had

promised him that he
