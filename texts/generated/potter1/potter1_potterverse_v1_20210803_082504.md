## Chapter 1

She smirked at those red eyes who were watching her carefully. “We’ll see about that later,

Bellatrix” he said in a low voice as he rose from the sofa and slipped down the hallway to leave

Hermione alone with his lover. When he turned around, he walked towards Harry and Ron, placing their

arms around each other tightly before taking a seat on either side of him without looking back at

them again for another moment until they were standing close together so Draco could give some

space. He looked up into Fleur's blue eyes, feeling her magic still rise within her. She smiled

warmly at him while she took in his form completely but did not look away when he closed the

distance between them slightly enough so both could feel it for themselves once more after

everything that had just transpired. Chapter 19: The Tale Of Bella Bella Notes: Sorry I don't have

this chapter yet! For all my readers out there love you boys!! :D (See the endofthechapter for more

notes.) Chapter Text BETA LOVE – TBC "I think we should get married" -Severus/Lucius Severus met

Lucius' gaze briefly and, knowing that was exactly what they wanted right now because neither witch

actually believed that things would ever be any better than they already are, turned to kiss him

passionately. Without hesitation or shame at first glance nor even a hint trying anything, Snape

pulled himself closer to the younger man. As he began unbuttoning one of her knickers, Draco felt

himself becoming aroused. He was sure his insides had been piked with arousal since the first time

they had sex, but now that it wasn’t too much longer before Hermione were all over him and having to

pull off her panties again...he knew she would be able take what needed being taken care not just on

her own accord; so he reached for a handkerchief and started cleaning up and wiping down her body

while moving his hands slowly along each corner in between them as if searching for something

unfamiliar. Draco grunted under Snape's intense gaze and moaned out loud when Lucius pulled back

from behind her to give Severus more room and then pushed open her arsehole slightly further. Once

he had gotten into place around three quarters inch of exposed flesh—which he did within mere

seconds as well —Draco turned his head away and let go only when an audible crack sounded against

their parted lips. “Fuck!” His face heated at this revelation which he immediately understood

because he instinctively moved closer to show Lucius how aroused he could possibly get without

losing control. Just another little reminder that even though the only way to stop Draco Malfoy is

through taking advantage there are some very dangerous things he can do about Granger after

tonight…but why? Why should he feel guilty like this instead?! Notes: I love this story and want to

thank everyone who has read/reviewed my work ❤︎ Chapter Text She walked across the floor to her flat

and sat on a large velvet sofa, reading. There was no one else in sight. A door opened at their

backs and Hermione stopped, looking around. “What do you see?” Luna came rushing over and looked at

them with wide eyes before she looked back at Draco as if he had just asked her a question that

caused pain but not concern. When they were alone again it felt like an eternity ago. They were

sitting together on comfortable chairs, staring at nothing but books and newspapers. The sun was set

behind closed doors between two towers of trees and from behind trees sprang leaves that seemed

fruitless by comparison; every single leaf glowed bright orange-red. It wasn't until she approached

Harry or Ron that everything started moving faster than usual—and then, very suddenly there appeared

something behind the covers above Hermione's bed where someone had fallen asleep. Like Ginny held up

paper for him when things got too out Of control. Ginny's expression shifted once more and she

glanced down toward his legs which hadnt been able nearly enough already and the soft weight pulled

her closer. As if expecting some sort reaction, footsteps sounded below the curtain. Her heart

skipped a beat despite herself because even though this situation didn' seem so much different than

last time about anything other than sexual matters all day long… She stood frozen halfway up in

front watching Fleur disappear into thin air after another minute passed. The brunette started to

kiss the blonde, and she’d said it was just a simple kiss… but as soon her lips had left Fleurs lips

were curled around Hermione‘s waist again before turning her head away from them with the other

witch gently. “I can't wait to see you in my arms for hours!” A knock on the door startled Hermione

from where she was standing up. She leaned over to look at Luna who had the distinct feeling that

she didnned an eye-catching brown sweater tied to everything she looked like tonight when in her

uniform... no, pants or something. Her eyes flashed red all of sudden, giving off more than usual

excitement. It made her blush a little as she opened one long finger towards Draco Malfoy slightly

higher then the others; which caused Harry Potter's expression go completely blank as he did so.

Instead they both stared down at eachother for a moment, Hermione knowing that this meant Lucius

would be doing some kind action while Severus continued his kissing, as if doing so wasnt necessary.

~~~*~~~~*********** After spending about half an hour in bed, Draco finally spoke. "Did you really

not notice how hard you hit your mark?" He asked with obvious arousal as Harry felt his throat begin

clenching painfully against him. His hands moved slowly across between Ginny Weasley breasts where

there are several tears rolling out onto their swollen cheeks. Ginny sighed heavily under her

breath, and Hermione's eyes widened in horror as she saw a pale red face that was wearing nothing

but his usual black robes; he must have been naked since they were dressed this morning either way

due to the cold weather or maybe because of what happened at work. "You look like you're going all

night," said Harry who had just returned from visiting with Dumbledore after he had spent more time

alone than usual. His voice sounded much quieter now that it seemed. He gave Ron an apologetic smile

before turning back to him once more, looking a bit lost again. It was clear that Harry was upset

over something, especially if it made sense to do so on a whim. The rest went rather well until

Molly stepped out of bed leaving Harry and Tonks both looking worried. After everyone left the Great

Hall for dinner, she got up and headed downstairs where there wasn't any sign outside. She picked

one side of Snape’s head, stood next to Poppy sitting next Neville in front while Severus waited

quietly behind Pansy staring down into space as the others did too when he finally emerged. Once he

was sitting down, Draco, Nott Sr., Cho Chang...and Professor Sprout rushed forward, trying not to

look alarmed. “He knows about your assignment, Mr Potter?” asked Minerva. Her eyebrows shot up. At

least she didnned Hogwarts uniform today. Snape smirked at them nervously then quickly turned away

from the couple. Hermione continued to stare at him for a few moments before she finally came back

and sat down on her bed, looking up into his eyes before looking around as if expecting something

bad would happen next time they went out. Chapter 22: Ron Summary: Prompt: "I told you so." — “You

know what I want" Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger Notes : Hey guys! So now we're going in

together again...again :) Here's my second prompt chapter (and it has some pretty lovely visuals).

It isn't all raunchy and there is definitely lots of sex between the two girls; but not much sexual

action really that I can say about this one though. Just please don’t let me ruin it forever by

leaving comments or anything ;) Alpha Chapter Text When Harry and Draco walked through Diagon Alley

early last week during their first shopping trip over, Hermione had gone with more than just her

things. They were going outside. She was planning everything, taking care off-leash since she knew

she wouldn 'get' any extra work done while doing it. No matter how many times he pointed out that

people should be allowed an extra day because elves needed extra money, or even hours worked each

night without getting sick, he always seemed like someone who could do whatever was required of

them. Sure enough when the three boys entered Madam Puddifoot's office, both men were looking quite

good. “Come in, let me know if anything gets wrong with the room you have in here before I send word

to Daphne that she’s alright and will be back as soon! Oh my god, this isn't going to end well for

you guys, because Draco is starting an argument so it could get ugly right about now - he doesn- he”

The doors opened on their way out of Harry Potter Manor. Hermione saw a familiar face at either side

her and then they were outside where there was no one around to greet them; they had just apparated

into another part within Hogwarts called Hagrid House (in Hogsmeade). ‘Hermione! How are things?�

asked Ron Weasley who looked up from his copy over to look between Hermione Granger sat across

behind him in front by Albus Dumbledore sitting next to Neville Longbottom. He took in the small

group of students facing him while looking sternly at the others. When he realised what they d been

doing he sighed. This was not how he felt anymore. Hadnt he started a fight already when the first

thing he did after seeing the new Headmaster being named Headmistress McGonagall was ask Ginny to

join the other three wizards running towards her house. They all followed her line and gave chase

down Harry until they reached Hagrigar Black, who was pacing closer than usual giving Hermione a

glare. She

## Chapter 2

She smirked at those red eyes who were watching her carefully. “We’ll see about that later,

Bellatrix” he said without hesitation and she rose to leave him alone with his parents as they left

the room to take their leave. Hermione had a feeling how much this was going on between them when

they walked into Grimmauld Place together after Harry walked in from Diagon Alley trying not to hex

the other girls around him. She felt herself growing colder than she ever did before; anger and

worry crept up over every word spoken by the others and it made her feel like she wasn't just being

taken advantage of but also needed someone to protect her. The foursome headed back for bed next

morning. When they returned to Hogwarts, Hermione was still angry all night and even though they

weren's only friends, they didnt get along well. They never got past eachother more than once or

twice so it wouldn— ‘I think we should go now‡ Draco muttered under one breath while Ron groaned

against Blaise. He thought that if he wanted to be able fight an argument then he would have kept it

quiet because he knew what happened during the last war. However...what could they possibly do?

Would they let themselves go anyway? What choice does anyone make… How can I stop anything?! If

neither one is here anymore, maybe someday people will ask me why you don-- No- One has any idea

where my mind took me! And yet here I am, waiting for the end. ‘Granger-’ The girl was still there,

twitching slightly when Hermione spoke again in her ear and let out a sigh as she looked down at

them both looking up at Bellatrix who stood by herself staring off into space. She had no idea how

long this would last; it seemed like forever if she didn't make some sort of deal with the mudbloods

or whatever they were doing to her. All Hermione could think of was that something must have

happened between her, after all. What did she do now? Where should she go next? But before she knew

what exactly happened inside Narcissa Malfoy's head lay on an agonizingly slow path to getting rid

from her body. Once she was certain she wasn "there" she turned back towards Lucius' bedchamber and

began slowly pacing through his rooms. After taking inventory just before leaving Draco he made sure

nothing else went wrong so Voldemort couldn get around him. He even got to take a shower which only

served to bring more pain and discomfort along with being at risk for waking someone but not

necessarily death. When everything cleared away Hermione walked over beside Harry holding onto Ron

as though praying that he wouldnt wake anyone other than him knowing things about her whereabouts.

"Harry, can you say goodbye?" Her voice broke apart because she felt tears coming welling in front

either side of her eyes. Her lips parted wide giving a small smile to the others in front, "you'll

see". When she said it, they all burst into applause for their bravery and Hermione was sure that

everyone else had been singing along too. At this point Harry glanced up at Ginny, and when he did

not look back his gaze returned towards them with determination. "Now, now, I'm glad you've decided

to join us." The girls exchanged looks as well before quickly disappearing from sight while Hermione

took her leave. They headed out of Grimmauld Place feeling incredibly nervous about what might

happen next. As soon as they got outside the door to get ready to apparate away Ron called after

them, but without looking or speaking word came over him. He dropped down onto one knee watching

closely where the last of them were standing on top platform two. Voldemort's voice came through the

barrier like thundering water making his shoulders drop off slightly knocking lightly against his

head. The girl behind him looked scared even more than Draco had felt once upon moments ago, her

hair hung loose around her face as if trying hard enough so no one could see anything, though there

was no doubt either of the girls wanted attention anyway. Feeling reassured by their new

surroundings, the man reached forward grabbing his wand hand and holding it aloft. For some reason

he didn't need any help pulling himself free until he was fully clothed again. Chapter 9: New

Beginnings Summary: A little bit about me...well....I’m sorry for the long wait. I know you two are

making things so difficult, but we need to work on our relationship and make sure this story is

accurate before any of us can have anything important happen. If you notice that I don't appear in

many scenes at all (that I do), I apologize! But there is no reason to worry - these chapters are

just a few more steps forward towards realising what they will become if we continue to be apart.

*EDIT* Now, as always with reviews- my love?! And thank you again everyone who has taken their time

reading through the review or commenting!! Chapter 2 Notes:- WARNINGS: BDSM/assault scene, sexual

scenarios, etc; smut by draco3k, lotsa scene where multiple times pregnant woman gets fucked while

trying not take full responsibility) WORLD NOTES ABOUT CHARACTERS : This chapter contains mature

themes such homophobia, blood purity issues, and some violence against women without consent from

either parent(s). See those notes after the break up because it's very clear how much emotional

turmoil characters may experience when faced WITH one another alone regarding an unwanted pregnancy

AND whether someone else was involved during the same scenario. So please keep being respectful &

understanding until next time.. (See the end plot summary under "COMING SOON" below.) Chapter Text

April tick tock Hermione awoke early once more, feeling slightly lighter than she had since waking

last night. She got up and walked around the corner of a small shop that was decorated in dark green

paint to make her look like someone who had been with her all day. A man called Fred in for a moment

then he turned and looked at her. "Ron, what are you doing here?" He asked as he grabbed her hand

and pulled away from Ron when they were alone again before turning back toward him again after

another minute or two without saying anything else over his shoulder about it; Draco couldn't help

but think how much better this would be if Hermione wouldn’t have gotten detention during class

because of it. The man sighed heavily into her hair and kissed the top lip once more where there

hadn- ever seen it so close between them. He reached out and touched it gently enough not causing

any problems but also making Draco feel some sort thing within him. It didnll do to get caught by

anyone though, which meant that even knowing exactly why Harry had done what he did would give

Hermione something new to know about the man, especially considering how completely different the

two boys seemed now. “Ah, I see… You can read my mind?” Hermione smiled widely through clenched

teeth. This time she only shook her head loudly against an ice cold wall and leaned forward until

Draco felt her stiffen on either side of their face and press her lips together just below the

collarbones of theirs while the other slowly sank down next towards him. His fingers twitched as

they slid over his lap, their breathless movement causing a tingling sensation to run through his

body and into every part it touched; the backs furrowed and he opened his eyes wide in fear, hoping

that something was wrong with Hermione’s hands on her thighs; she had been trying not to touch

herself because there were so many things that made her feel like this...he couldn't think about

what she might be doing right now. “Draco…” The words came out slow and lifeless but loud enough for

Draco's ears even though their entire body shook at how open he could see them from all angles. He

didnt know if he should say them or not, just want answers first, especially after hearing those

last few words coming from the man who had asked him such questions - Harry Potter! ‘What did you do

to us?  Draco almost choked when he felt his head jerking back up slightly under pressure to keep

from swallowing. Now that everything seemed settled and done then he knew why he had wanted more

from Harry, no one would have believed him before. It had taken some time since Ron said anything

else but that he wasn—wasn--not going anywhere anymore. Because it had never mattered until now,

neither ever cared where Harry lived or worked or whose family he was with. And yet here stood Draco

Malfoy looking out onto his own feet, and the look in Bellatrix’s eyes said something. “You will be

lucky if you are all right with me. I am not going to hurt you or any of you—unless that means

killing myself again,” she continued quietly as she turned her face to Hermione who had taken a step

back from him before she could say anything else… ‘Do we have time for this conversation? We need

more than words about that kind of thing!‡ he mumbled, not really daring show himself down there

anymore. She ignored it completely so far; she wanted an outlet for things she found wanting inside

herself… but what was even worse were being unable at least some part-of-him to hold on to her

feelings either. It was clear to everyone watching that they needed their time to grow and move

together without any fight. The moment she realized how much longer she would have to act like this,

Bella looked away and left the room. Once outside Lucius entered, followed by Snape giving them both

privacy. He wasn't exactly sure why he was leaving behind his daughter now knowing everything except

that Narcissa already knew too. Maybe Voldemort hadnt seen through Granger's lies though… maybe it

was because of him… Whatever it is they want, whatever the Death Eaters think they can get across,

just know when it has been stolen…. Chapter 15: A New Beginnings Summary: This chapter contains a

new beginning

## Chapter 3

She smirked at those red eyes who were watching her carefully. “We’ll see about that later,

Bellatrix” he said, looking down at the tiny witch in front of him before turning to face his father

and raising an eyebrow slightly from where it was visible on their faces with a smug smirk running

along its length for just a moment longer than necessary as if they thought she would be offended by

hearing his voice again. Draco gave Hermione back what looked like genuine amusement; a smile that

only she could have imagined being used by someone so uninterested in getting caught laughing when

she was actually enjoying herself. When Bellatsia began speaking he raised a brows towards them, but

did not pull away or deny any comment while she continued talking. Hermione stood up hastily around

Bellin's desk, throwing her arms around the older woman  shoulders to block out all light coming

through the window. She smiled sweetly into her pillow and took a deep breath before leaving the

room. As she left Hermione tried desperately trying find a way to get some sleep which had been hard

enough due to everything else. Finally after taking long strides forward against every wall Draco

stepped onto one side next door to Snape sitting opposite Lucius looking over his shoulder. He felt

nervous because he knew exactly how much time he was going take until he finally got to himself and

spoke. "We'll head home," Malfoy said softly. Narcissa nodded and went upstairs. They entered

silence. The only sound came from inside the room, but no one was looking at them except for Lucius

who seemed to be staring blankly at his daughter as she walked towards him in an almost-drunk state

with a look of pure desperation on her face and that expression alone made Hermione's heart skip all

over again - he looked just like Narcissa before the war ended; like Draco when they were young or

younger. She swallowed heavily as though it had been poison staining his mouth. “Are you okay?” Tom

asked her softly, pressing his lips against hers so the hairs between their bodies stood up. Her

head snapped up into question, looking around confused. He placed both hands upon either side where

there would have normally not appeared any trouble, and then leaned forward gently while whispering,

"I need some rest." Hermione bit her lip and reached down to wipe away tears. It took several

seconds for Tom let himself drop back onto her lap, his eyes widening slightly until he could see

everything clearly through those glasses. There wasn't much more than a bruise on either cheek which

reminded her greatly how bad she felt about him, especially now that he was gone. His voice was

quiet and almost afraid, as he closed his fists behind his knees tightly, resting his forehead

against theirs. Hermione gasped out weakly once every few moments, trying desperately hard within

herself mentally this time because she knew exactly what she needed to hear. This might still hurt,

if he was so sure she was okay with it as well… "Hermione…" Sirius gasped, his face red and swollen

from the shock of seeing her bleeding out. "I will not go on about this right now," Remus said

softly before reaching up for Hermione's hand again where they were resting. It took a few moments

until Hermione let her fingers drop away from him without even looking at them or pulling back in

fear that something was wrong. She looked around once more, and found Harry kneeling next Toogy. He

sat down between Ron who had already made himself comfortable and Ginny, who both looked horrified

by the scene. After hearing their voices coming from downstairs Remused what ever he wanted, then

turned back to Kingsley who sat beside McGonagall. 'They did' the man began speaking quietly but

clearly warningly; 'That they could never get past the Head Boy and Healer….' 'You do realize I am

going after this Mudblood?” Dumbledore demanded harshly. The man nodded quickly. “Goodness knows we

are here to make sure you stay calm.' He added smoothly, while making sure it didn't sound like

anger. McGonsagall stared at Remirius dumbfounded. Clearly, there was no way any information would

be leaked because of these two boys. And given how dangerous this situation is - Severus, Lupin-

Black – Voldemort must have known everything else! If only James and Lily hadnt been so desperate to

save the day,” she said. “It was a lot of work, I know—and then you saved them both from death and

all that shit! And now they're in my house, living with me. They can't help it, but there's nothing

for them here. Even if they were willing enough…they don't have anyone who would take care of their

family. That means Severus needs someone, someone he could love. Someone who will protect them. It

won-‡ She clutched her wand tighter as tears started pouring down her cheeks again; the pain had

stopped. Her mother had never let a tear fall or trick into something like this before – she could

feel its sadness, which left Harry wondering how she would ever forgive him. But what did Snape

want? ‘If only we could talk about it through some semblance normalcy…but just because his feelings

weren tinged by anger doesn...not mean they aren - the things are different.' The words had escaped

her lips at once when suddenly an angry voice broke out of nowhere, piercing through from within the

room. Hermione smiled sadly, knowing that this person might not know where she stood. A shadow fell

across Draco Malfoy on cold stone ground below and slowly began moving towards Voldemort himself:

'Where is your father?' He stood stiffly against dark stone walls, his posture stiff, eyes guarded

as though he was afraid lest come to blows with her. “I’m just waiting for you both here before I

move out of the building.” She blinked, shoulders drawing back in a tight stance, trying desperately

to contain the full intensity that overcame him. He clenched his jaw at last and released a slow

breath. His father didn't sound too pleased by their abrupt departure, but it wasn—not entirely

unexpected given the circumstances this time around; Severus hadn't been involved since she had

taken his hand during lunch. And perhaps it would be best if they stayed away from each other until

such an event arose? It only served Hermione s interest better that Riddle decided on something

different. Hermione stood straighter than ever, staring past Lucius into space beyond Draco's

shoulder blades while Snape navigated them through rows upon row without interruption or reprimand…

The silence was oppressive, suffocating even when one gazed up sideways once more. But despite its

stifling weight all those years ago- ‘Mione! Please don keep me informed!  Harry started down

another aisle of patients as soon came to mind– "Oh no!" Luna's frantic voice echoed loudly across

every surface within reach, muffled by glass bottles and heavy chairs. Her stomach twisted painfully

as she opened her mouth and peered over heads at Potter alone sitting beside McLaggen looking gaunt

against frozen blackness at Malfoy Manor entrance where Granger remained seated beneath Pansy

Parkinson. Hermione was sitting on her bed, holding a book of books and some parchment. Podski's

eyes were fixed upon hers as she stared at them all in amazement. “I thought you might like to see

how the two have become so good friends since their graduation.” The older woman glanced back up

from under one eye before answering with an innocent smile that Hermione could feel radiating off

its surface almost to herself now for being so innocent when such love had occurred in such a tender

moment of moments between mates or lovers? ‘I can only imagine what it must be like for your father

after everything he’s been through during his time here. You would think him dead right then and

there but..  I mean, Merlin, Ron will always hold me hostage...he just seems more loyal than ever

-and therefore feels entitled to do whatever he wants! He has no idea anything is amiss because he

doesn't want to let my mother suffer." Her gaze shot up to meet Draco Malfoy's grey stare and she

felt his brow arch. "And even if he did?" She couldn't help smiling over at Daphne Greengrass who

smiled back at Ginny Weasley who nodded slowly and added "I'm sorry about your hair. It's lovely

though." Draco smiled shyly at Blaise Zabini who was staring down across towards Neville Longbottom

whose cheeks flushed faintly. 'They're both bright and talented.' she added, her voice barely

audible. Hermione saw his eyes flicker to the side. He was talking about Snape's deathbed confession

that he had killed Voldemort in a bid for revenge on him – with only minor details of what he'd said

or done. The Dark Lord was alive now? She tried not to cringe at how easily those words could be

lost on such an elderly man (who probably hadn't been in her head long). A death-by-' Death Eater

who no longer existed. Who lived somewhere near where it took her forever - 'You are dead?' Another

round filled up the airwaves. In a split second they vanished. They were gone again! And then there

came another explosion: as if from a very high, dark tower. Suddenly something flew past them,

almost skidding through the sky itself; everyone stood frozen against their sides while Ron Weasley

moved away from Harry Potter once more before collapsing back into himself. His body fell forward

onto its own accord, just above the rubble below it so tightly packed like smoke they all felt like

bones shivered beneath theirs without taking off. There seemed nothing left but dust that had

settled down around Harry since Snape died and drifted outwards slowly towards Draco Malfoy 'Snape'

breathed Ginny softly 'I'm sorry' she whispered, pressing a hand over hers briefly still buried deep

within herself 'you're sorry I murdered you. It happened too many times.' 'What about
