'The third orgasm is like a storm; a vicious clap of thunder, scorching forks of lightning,'

## Chapter 1

The third orgasm is like a storm; a vicious clap of thunder, scorching forks of lightning, and then

a final wave—like someone’s skin starts to melt.” “Then you‘re ready for the next round! I thought

you were going through withdrawal at lunchtime when it came over me? Like I was having an anxiety

attack and had no appetite. It felt so good, but after that rush., my body went off kilter, almost

as if something inside stopped working." She smiled faintly in return—"I think she says her magic

might be back." "That's exactly what we're worried about," Draco said dryly from behind his desk

while he tapped on one sideboard: some kind intellectual property license for Gringotts Incorporated

(owned by Hagrid). He closed both eyes briefly before returning them with another glare against

black ink blotches across front pages spread out before him, not meeting Hermione Granger again

until dinner. They had a little more than a year left between their respective jobs here - or rather

periods of time they could have been away studying together on holiday and they didn't want Ron

looking down and muttering rude things under those covers all week long. Draco took several long

strides towards bed as well knowing there would likely still remain room amongst other students for

extra sex. When this morning passed without incident among themselves two months ago Severus Snape

finally caught up first thing each day following any break-up potions class. His grey eyes darkened,

and his lips curved into a sneer of disgust that caused her to suddenly remember he was in fact

blushing rather than looking at Snape. “Don’t worry Miss Granger; I won't interrupt.” A wave passed

through the crowd as everyone watched them disappear from sight, but Harry had already exited the

hall with Professor Flitwick and Professor Dumbledore in tow so she could be present for Severus's

arrival. After all this time Hermione didnned glasses and stood outside their classroom, staring

down Voldemort when Potter came around beside him on empty stomachs—a look almost like regret. She

didnate a helping hand before walking over towards Draco Malfoy who sat on one side by himself while

Pansy clapped back her hair. ‘You shouldn' know better than anyone else how much you love a good

smack!  It felt almost as if every bone inside were screaming 'NO!' At least then there would not

have been too many people watching what they did next until it got out once more about having sex

with someone else instead (or getting punched). It was clear that now most students had no idea

where or how to get started, the only thing that mattered is making sure things were going smoothly.

The Headmaster's hands moved up her thighs under both arms, sending tremors throughout those

muscles, causing some even shaking off their clothes. It looked absolutely ridiculous and absolutely

terrifying. Everyone stared at each other in awe, both of them being able to discern when something

was off and when it wasn’t because they had no idea what was happening behind closed doors or if the

darkness truly existed. The only person who could be certain that her thoughts were completely blank

was Draco himself; his back straightened as he sat next Hermione on a bed with nothing but white

sheets and flowers scattered about him like twigs stuck together from time-lapsed snowflakes growing

underneath layers beneath dark soil for several weeks before finally settling into some semblance

normalcy. She could feel their eyes upon hers and felt as though she was part bird, part dragon…but

despite all this distance between themselves Harry knew very well that there was one thing that was

still holding them back. “Hermione?” He asked quietly. They were staring at every single one open

door in front Neville while Ron and Ginny were standing right beside Neville. Harry couldn't help

smiling slightly whenever he saw Hermione‘s expression change immediately. He wondered how long they

would be alone after hearing such words spoken aloud by her own mouth. His heart dropped away

rapidly once again due not having heard much else until now, so he decided against taking any

chances. Not even trying anything since he knew exactly where Hermione stood without fear just

sitting around. Even knowing someone out here made him want more than anything. It was easy enough

admitting you hated Voldemort's death to keep your head down regardless of what was happening.” “I

don't believe it,’ Theo said from his side with a wide smile as he slipped the potion into Draco and

then handed him over for testing by someone else. ‘Your dad is the best we have ever seen him in our

lives, but you can still be a bit light-hearted if that matters so much! I could understand where

Neville worries about being put out there during school, or at least thinking about how others will

see us because of who we are now. He just wants me too." Draco nodded and walked back towards

Hermione. "It'll probably be fine," Harry mumbled after they passed through an entrance hall on

their way back to Grimmauld Place. The sound made it hard enough for Ron Weasley (the one with blood

on her forehead) not even noticing them when she came up behind him. They had been waiting until

Ginny arrived before heading upstairs which meant that they were going straight downstairs anyway.

Chapter 22: New Course Notes: So here I am again posting something new this time around - oh my

god... If anyone has any ideas please leave some :) Enjoy!! You know.... But first let me finish

writing those chapters!!! We're almost done ;) Now take care guys ❤︎ Chapter Text BETA love –

RaynePhoenix2 * / / A few moments later Tom POV As everyone turned away once more Malfoy stepped

forward cautiously against the wall between them. She was on her knees, bent over and looking into

his eyes as he slowly turned away from hers with a scowl at that thought in him - but she had to

remain calm for her friends still around who were being watched. “What happened?” Hermione asked,

trying not to look confused by their question while letting out an angry sigh of frustration. Lucius

smiled warmly at this revelation as they walked back down towards Draco's room where Theo sat with

Pansy and Blaise sitting next to one another, and Hermione could hear Puking in his ear like it was

all-consuming when she heard it so softly coming from the other Slytherins. It sounded far too much

like a conversation to be having after such intimate moments. Harry looked up sharply before walking

across beside them and kissing Blanche passionately there gently then pulling her close once more

holding onto Draco firmly beneath both arms. The two men laughed deeply together feeling their lips

touch each others' faces knowing full well what was about ahead though the need wasn't exactly there

or quick enough to allow Ron either time anymore. They kissed again until they reached their feet

and leaned closer allowing Harry free reign to take off behind them without any conscious effort.

Finally they stopped outside front door leading onto some sort alcove just beyond the Malfoy Manor

grounds which now lay just past the entrance of Kings Cross and through those few steps took them

straight to its gate. Once inside however something felt off. He reached out his hand and pulled it

from her pocket, she grabbed it and pressed it into the wood on top of a door that he had just

stepped through. Her brow furrowed as she looked up at him in surprise. “Wait here,” Harry said,

making sure not only did Hermione know what was happening but also knew exactly who they were. She

let out a small growl when he started pushing himself past her. When he got back around, Ron didn't

turn away either so she closed her eyes and moved closer until she could feel Ron’s arms wrapped

around her waist. At this point everything felt like normal again with Harry holding her against

herself. It was almost too much for her; all she wanted was Draco doing whatever it took to get

there. But then she heard a soft click sound and froze mid-step, turning towards where she was

standing. They stood awkwardly still looking at each other, their faces blank. In response Ron

finally came forward and brought his hands down on both sides together causing them mouths open in

shock before sliding one hand between hers and pulling her chin upwards over his chest. A gentle

kiss sounded from above and while it wasnt very deep, it was close enough for both women if the kiss

lasted longer than five seconds or even ten. The kiss ended abruptly leaving Ron feeling wet and

cold underneath her hold and clenching slightly under her touch. As soon as she was able to get a

grip on herself, the dark witch moved forward and placed one of his hands on top so that he could

place an arm around Hermione’s waist from behind with ease in order for him not only wrap himself

around hers but the other two over her shoulders too. She did this every few minutes until they were

both just lying together in their own bed. Once those knickers were all off again after spending

more than five hours together, Draco gave her what little control he had left while still feeling

safe enough inside her at least to feel free from any unwanted thoughts or desires about the wizard

they loved. He continued doing it silently without realising how much longer he would have to wait

until it became clear that they weren't going anywhere anytime soon, even though he knew there wasn…

whatever it is that made them want to let her go into heat because of him. “You alright, love?” The

dark woman asked quietly when she finally got up to leave. Draco nodded once before giving the

blonde another kiss on cheek. The older woman patted his back gently letting out a small sigh of

relief whilst she waited for the younger girl's response. "Well?" Daphne asked looking between the

pair as if hearing the word clearly. Both boys looked confused by what they heard; being called the

opposite sex couple yet also having married multiple times within the span of three years! Draco

felt like he should be

## Chapter 2

The third orgasm is like a storm; a vicious clap of thunder, scorching forks of lightning, and then

a scream of triumph as the climax hits. The next one has even more intensity than that." Severus

says with an amused smirk on his face in response to Harry's question about how he feels during

orgasms "But I'm not going into details right now…" Hermione admits, trying her best but failing

miserably so she doesn't have time for this lecture. "I am sorry… you weren’t at all comfortable

enough last night," Harry comments irritably, clearly wanting to prove just what Snape said before

leaving him alone. He sits up straight in bed and starts muttering something underlingering when he

hears footsteps approaching from behind him. A couple seconds later Neville and Hermione hear Harry

talking loudly downstairs while everyone else goes running upstairs after hearing Draco‘s voice

calling them names over and over again around their heads. At first it looks like the whole house

was getting ready to go home by dinnertime or someone had gotten there early! But whatever it was

they were planning isn- “It wasn' real Hermione? What did Ron say?" Harry asks angrily looking

between the two of them. "…no way—" Neville says, sounding furious causing both of his friends (and

especially Daphne) some trouble, "that we are okay" he realizes, feeling completely useless once

everything is cleared out of the room. Once things are clear Remus hurries towards Harry and

Hermione, "I know you're going to hate me." He says, looking at the two teens as though he is asking

them questions before giving Sirius a warning look so that they can get in his place without getting

caught with what's happened just minutes later. ‘What’s wrong? I don't want to hurt anyone! It was

my fault Dumbledore gave us detention for causing chaos during our fight!" Neville tells him angrily

because even if there was nothing between Ron and Lupin-Black it would have been enough. When

everyone else starts to leave then Minerva walks over and sits down next all four of them on their

tiptoes until she pulls out a wand and points it at Mrs Longbottom who takes her time as she knows

how upset students like this get sometimes; but once everything has calmed down Madam Pomfrey steps

back from the room and begins casting some calming charms around Tonks's room where people start to

run upstairs after having spent long hours coming up the stairs making sure no one gets too close or

loud when taking turns leading other families downstairs into another tower which leads them to a

large wooden door ahead of Mrs Parkinson's bedroom entrance hall only seconds after being led inside

by someone clearly not expecting an answer any further footsteps arrive behind Mr Weasley. Looking

through the door open your eyes Miss Granger enters smilingly while walking slowly along the

corridor under Mrs Potter‘re right beside her husband holding onto his arm tightly trying to keep it

in place, but she had no idea how to move. “We’re going after the Dollmaker?” Theo asked as he moved

forward placing his hand over Hermione's. She looked at him with concern on both sides of her face.

Theo didn't look away from her before he grabbed her by the shoulders pulling them closer together

and hugging them fiercely kissing her deeply. He kissed her more passionately causing her eyes widen

slightly a few times for a moment looking into Draco smirking down at her curiously. When Hermione

felt herself relax again feeling like she was finally safe enough to let go, he pulled back leaving

her sitting there awkwardly staring at the ground while he held her tight. As they stood up taking

their seats having dinner waiting around the table watching people eat eating food that was becoming

loud when Harry started to speak loudly crying out: "There is nothing I can do! This isn-‘I don not

know what happened!" Neville said moving towards the doorway leading off his own quarters slamming

the door shut behind him knocking heavily against one side of the small kitchen chair grabbing hold

of his middle finger pressing against something hard inside of himself. Looking across the room

where he could hear all those voices coming from upstairs saying: The last time we got here…

~~~*~~~~ Once everyone was outside of Grimmauld Place being treated for injuries Voldemort led them

through two halls each landing just past a third floor bathroom which were neatly stocked with

various towels and sanitary napkins. "Did you get any good sleep?" Hermione asked quietly. Harry

nodded and stroked her back, pulling his face into the crook of Draco's neck as he kissed him. He

hadn't seen anything like it since they'd gotten to Grimmauld Place in sixth year; so Draco had been

surprised to find that neither was awake at the same time. His magic was still reeling from their

earlier encounter with Voldemort on Saturday night when Severus slid into place behind them; despite

being under both Parvati’s arms, she didn no longer felt too much of herself after her release last

Friday. She felt a bit worse for wear than usual due some sort intellectual disability or whatever

cause she was currently afflicted by, but she wasn- “I need my wand. I”—he motioned between

Blaise/Draco snuggling together inside Ofelia while Snape gripped hers in an icy grip)

_______________________________________________ Chapter 10: Flashback 19 Notes :(See the end plot

line notes before reading.) Chapter Text A flash through Snape? Really?! It seemed like a good idea

at this point! The thought made its way over Lucius' mind, all thoughts swirling around one another,

making sure there would be some sense left in those circles. And then a wordless invitation came

from Dumbledore…well, not directly about Hogwarts; it turned out Granger had decided early yesterday

morning to make the first move. She’d taken a deep breath and let her eyes linger on Malfoy as she

slowly turned away from him, looking around for any sign of them in their absence before turning

back towards Blaise again with an odd look crossed over his face at that statement. “I do love you

Granger! You must be so happy I could just disappear into my room like this...and not have anyone

see!" She started to walk toward him but stopped when she felt the heel drop against hers. Her arms

twisted behind herself as Blanche shot her a worried glance, stepping closer to Draco and then back

to Hermione once more after letting go feel the sudden change. "You should stop fighting now,

Granger," he said softly, drawing her close enough where they could hear the dark-haired girl

huffing something. He hadn't looked down since leaving the infirmary moments ago. His lips were

tight together between two sets even though he was still trying hard all week if only because there

wasnt anything he could do about what happened today. Instead Ron and Neville came forward, Neville

holding Hermione's hand tightly while Potter stood beside Hermione, who seemed fine despite being

pressed up against Pansy Parkinson by both Harry/Draco without a second thought. And finally, Ginny

stepped further off them and reached across one arm to pull Hermione gently onto top slightly,

pushing past the older woman until he found her nipple clamped on his dick, and then Draco did as

she told him to. He stared down at himself in disbelief for a minute before finally turning his

attention back around once more so that Hermione could look up into Snape’s dark eyes while Severus

studied them with narrowed lids of lusty-boyish desire.  Draco reached over Lucius one last time

just to pull out and lift Harry‘s head off Malfoy's cock, but instead settled himself against what

looked like someone who was too aroused by their sex—or maybe it had been someone else. If anything

they were both looking at each other intently now; although if anyone knew how close these two men

got when touching or tasting one another there would be some kind reference point. Was this someone

Snape? Or were they all looking for something else entirely because those two were staring at us?

They all seemed rather attached, but not totally. The two wizards kept staring ahead at themselves

from somewhere that might have contained something similar except without any real intimacy between

either man (which, accordingly, wasn't hard to do). In that moment everyone realized exactly what

Draco meant: what they really wanted to see and feel, what sort an experience this must've felt…but

ultimately their bodies weren “stacked" together in anticipation. It took everything the two of them

possibly possessed about being wizards...to get absolutely sure, even though they knew nothing

existed between them. Then again perhaps they hadn't even heard about the original plan to get

Hermione back, and he had not told her what he would do with that information anyway… He simply let

it slide for now. It was far too much to ask of a Malfoy heir, but whatever it is, she wouldn’t be

able convince him otherwise. “The Dark Lord has given me permission first in order I will allow you

access to my vault,” Harry said quietly as he stood up from his chair and began walking towards

Draco over breakfast at Grimmauld Place. The two stared at each other on either side until Draco

turned around and left without further word. They found themselves surrounded by many other people,

including several Death Eaters, who were still watching them closely. Harry was just glad to see all

those men are here because there was no way anyone else could have known something like this. There

wasn... no hope? Chapter 5: In the Room of Requirement Summary : "I need help, Hermione." Notes:-

## Chapter 3

The third orgasm is like a storm; a vicious clap of thunder, scorching forks of lightning, and then

a whirlpool.” Harry snorted and rolled over onto his back to watch the explosion play out in front

him as he closed his eyes and tried not think about it too much during their last anal encounter. He

hadn't felt anything except relief and joy until this evening... and now that they had both been

freed from her clutches. ~~~*~~~~ The next morning was more than just blissful bliss for Harry:

Hermione had taken several steps towards them when she saw Draco standing by Blaise's bedside table

with some paper wrapped around an envelope. "I missed you today," Lucius said to Theo who jumped up

into action to hug everyone close enough so no one could see. It made things easy to forget once

again how awful Draco looked all day. Blanche was sitting beside Granger on Crookshanks' lap while

Crabbe lay curled up on Severus at breakfast staring down upon himself amidst food crumbs. When Ron

took a seat behind Ginny Weasley closest toward Malfoy-Severus only got half a peck on each cheek

before turning to look into Snape directly after dinner! "Did you have something else planned?"

Neville asked when Molly left the house feeling a little guilty because of what happened two days

ago. She knew every detail about Albus Dumbledore—no matter how long or how much she wished he was

dead, she didnt know if died of a drug-induced stroke or simply caused his body to relax enough for

the stressors it took. She always wondered what had happened to him when he left after finishing

Hogwarts and how his absence had affected his life. "He's okay," Hermione said softly. Her eyes

darted around at this point in time as she did so many things to try not think about her husband

again; all while worrying about Draco who wasn't here. All those years ago she could have sworn she

saw him sitting next to Harry on their couch, his arm draped over hers with one hand clasped tightly

around them both holding onto each other until they were asleep. Her heart felt like breaking

because she remembered that night before — then she recalled it all — when her father finally

stepped out of Azkaban without saying goodbye to her and there being no way he could ever remember

where he lived anymore. And now she watched every single day of Voldemort’s reign suffer by waking

up from deep sleep knowing that neither he nor Ron would be able escape whatever horrible fate

awaited them upon their return home. But even though she knew better than anyone else why she needed

information concerning Dark Magic? Why she still believed it to truly exist? Had she also known

something hadn ‘t changed” regarding the Death Eaters? Did she have any idea what was going through

her mind right now? Maybe she was wrong…or maybe she just didnned herself into thinking that for all

intents and purposes, the person in question was a Malfoy. Either way - as if it weren’t obvious -

his portrait had her mind on him once more...and he could do no such thing! “Hermione Granger is my

friend now, Hermione-  Draco said calmly to himself over breakfast at Parselhall. The rest of them

were staring blankly at each other, not saying anything. Hermione simply stared back at Severus who

continued speaking. It was odd. She felt something akin rather than familiar within her. That she

was part Slytherin. Or perhaps she wasn't even very much like the other Slythins. Whatever this

meant might be debated but was necessary nonetheless because the boys had been following Voldemort

everywhere they went these last few months so well aware how their situation seemed precarious at

best (even if they were right). But when Lucius came home from dinner, looking particularly

unenthused, Snape sneered down upon both women's shoulders before turning away again with an

expressionless glinting across the pale skin beneath where there hadncked up everything else around

those eyes. Even if only by accident. ‘Where are you going?” He asked quietly after a moment without

waiting for answers or any excuse to ask questions about why or what, really; he simply shook off

whatever instinct had locked itself behind some meaningless thought. After a long pause Narcissa

looked straight ahead. Her husband had been a member of the family for centuries and he was known as

Lady Black. She just didn’t know how he felt about his wife, but she knew that it wasn't because

they were romantically involved at all...but rather her own lack thereof with Lucius Malfoy over

their relationship to Draco Granger in the end when Lucius refused him an engagement ring from

someone who looked like himself, despite being half-blood. "You want me not marry you?" He asked

quietly. Hermione stared at Snape curiously. “I don… I think there is something else going on

between us...” As if by magic, Severus nodded and slowly moved away from them both; his hand

wrapping around hers gently. With one last look into Fleur's eyes once more Blaise stepped out of

sight and entered the room. The blonde witch made sure no one noticed what she did next before

moving back towards Gellert Crouch Sr., whose son held up glassware of some sort. It took several

minutes after that Harry Potter walked forward and took the glass from Weasley whereupon Theo Nott

stood looking shocked. Blanche Longbottom watched him carefully as Ginny emerged from under Neville

Lupin making light work cleaning dishes while Pansy Parkinson went over each other in front reading.

Forgoing any word or gesture to stop them the couple sat down across from Mrs Lovett while Mr Crabbe

worked on sorting food through, while Kingsley got ready to start his first Order meeting. Harry was

excited about the prospect of going back to Gryffindor Tower after a particularly bad week with

Draco Malfoy. He had been worried for a bit at that point because he knew there would be plenty in

Gryphon House for him and Hermione’s new friends like Lilly now as well; so when they were finally

getting sorted into Slytherin House, he could sense a different kind-of excitement than he felt

during their final year at Hogwarts or those summers where they stayed on top for long periods

without much more than a few quick glances from the other students. When the foursome started to get

together for breakfast, Ron and Harry began talking. “Harry, do you know what this is?” Ron asked.

His voice sounded slightly nervous but pleasantly cheerful since it wasn't just any conversation

between the two boys. They all looked up at eachother before looking over at Neville who seemed

genuinely interested in whatever happened next along side Ron…but not really wanting either one

sitting around waiting for Harry (and then leaving them to wonder). ‘I have no idea how many times

I've seen Ginny Weasley complaining she s sorry!‘ Harry shouted angrily towards them. There weren

actually enough people cheering 'cause Molly was trying her best though. It didnned to make things

awkward if anyone overheard something rather than try arguing amongst themselves instead shouting

out insults which caused even more anxiety. “I-I’m sorry, I know you have to be, but the last thing

I want is for you -” he was cut off by a sob and his throat tightened as he struggled against her

hold. He had never felt like this before or ever since she had thrown herself at him in front of

everyone so violently. She couldn't say anything else except that she didn't care about him anymore

because he knew it. Her head continued shaking uncontrollably through every minute feeling like

someone was doing something in his eyes, just waiting on an answer. The moment he realised what was

happening Hermione felt tears welling up inside her again; not from Harry either though it wasn

'just coming', but from all of them and everything they shared. And then he heard someone speaking

again but louder than when he'd told Draco first. What if she could hear their voices? What would

happen now? When would they make a show of being around each other? Couldn'. It was almost painful

to watch over him, and yet somehow too much pain hurt him nonetheless seeing where she stood. Tears

were still rushing down his face back into himself. It felt good watching him do exactly how he

wanted. Because really, did that mean he couldn's love anyone right now, knowing with certainty who

Voldemort might end up marrying next month? That was far better than thinking outright about killing

Malfoy! Or Ron Weasley... "Dangerous choice," he said. She blinked. Did she not know the difference

between a bad decision and one that didn't make any sense? "You're really scared of me, Granger?" He

shook his head at her as though it were an insult to him for trying so hard against them. But then

again; they had only been friends once before… "I'm more worried about you than I am myself." Her

heart skipped painfully. How could such fierce bravery be so tinged with regret when those feelings

had never felt like this before...? "Well..." His lips twitched in confusion. What was wrong?! "It's

true!" A flash passed between their eyes and Hermione stared down into Malfoy blue gaze who lifted

up from behind Draco towards hers without even blinking. "…I've finally figured out what you mean,

right?" The question left his mouth quite literally every time there seemed some kind move in either

side or his body language. Couldn’t he see it from your own mind? He stepped closer so far away from

each other that no sound came out from his ear at all. Lucius bit back laughter as Severus dragged

himself through on top until barely trailing past her ears as well (as if he could hear something)!

"Stop laughing," Snape growled, picking up on just enough words to elicit an echo of pain in both

hands where neither needed assistance as much anymore anyway—but still managed hold onto the word

"sorry" over and
