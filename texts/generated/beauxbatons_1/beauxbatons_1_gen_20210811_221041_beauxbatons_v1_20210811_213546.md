'“Yes, I fucking did, because he’s a bloody Death Eater,'

## Chapter 1

“Yes, I fucking did, because he’s a bloody Death Eater,” James laughs. “I don't even know what to

say. What else is there for me? Everything… for you? To help someone that they might hate? That I

could do the same thing with them? Because it‘ll make everyone happy and love their lives more than

ever, isn´t really something people are willing or able-bodied enough of?‽ He nods his head, as if

all this will convince him otherwise before he proceeds into another tirade about how much worse

things have gotten when his brother was gone.James‟ Lily sighs quietly. She‹s practically trembling,

her body wracked by sweat from every step on display in front both eyes until she hears himself

again: There it came after everything so well done and so terribly wrong. It had been her idea then;

Lily Potter would be one hell of an actress whose performance at Hogwarts wasn—well...perfectly

parselmouth perfection — but her own heart hadn-, nothing like hers! It mustnâve happened sooner,

right? The word started circulating through the corridors only moments ago; no one knew where Sirius

Black went instead feeling desperate tears of despair sink down his cheeks and down your cheekbones

that were now streaked pink with longing.'The prophecy,' James said thoughtfully while taking in the

small amount upon which Remus's words seemed hollow beneath Severus Snape’s voice. 'He is the one

who was sent to Hogwarts after my death,' he said, and his voice sounded softer than it had in a

long time.'I have told you that Dumbledore has been a great man for many years now-- I will not

lie.''But what does this mean? Is this true?' Harry demanded as they returned, their eyes locked on

each other again like brothers before them but with arms still stretched apart from fingers so tight

between toes Sirius could feel all too familiar being there alone at such close quarters without any

way out of hiding himself or anyone else knowing about him besides Death Eaters spying upon school

life (or the Order if Minerva meant by her word). It just didn't make sense how much longer things

would continue to get worse since Dumbledore was gone.The silence was hushed by whispers and

grumbles, until James took up where Remulus left off; a wry smile tugging at Tom when Professor

Sinistra turned back to look at him rather curiously — then turned away once more as well...'You

haven—""What do we do today?" He asked slowly looking around at everyone else while Ron raised an

eyebrow at Hermione whose face betrayed no emotion. The twins shook their heads quickly, nodding

apologetically absentmindedly towards Luna whom looked far less angry than she had used earlier.

Remaining silent only for his own amusement, Ron continued: “And everything seems alright! We both

have our own issues and I'm sure you're well aware that.” She sighed, nodding toward Harry who was

still sat down on the bench with his books on him as he took a seat next to her in silence. Draco

watched quietly for any sign of Ginny's presence but she continued speaking only then did it move

off into another sitting area where they would continue talking until finally their seats were

empty.Draco opened his book again feeling a slight sting from when he read over what he had just

done with himself which made him cringe slightly at the thought about it being Harry or Ginny. He

knew this was not going smoothly and wondered if it was best to let them talk before having sex

since there wasn't much else to do besides sit together so far away from each other while they

talked…He reached up for some clothes pulling out his Quidditch uniform first brushing the loose

black robes around his waist leaving his hair behind rather than tugging back onto either side of it

yet still staying close enough between kisses to not smother the bottom line within

Hermione.'Merlin,' Ginny whispered suddenly. 'We've been waiting all day.''What?' Draco

exclaimed.'Harry?'The look upon him shocked Draco more now seeing how serious he looked at these

things happening right after tonight—''That doesn't make you anything less romantic, love!'A smile

spread across Malfoy features — clearly realizing something had happened instead."You needn´t worry

about your father," Hermione said. "We don’T have to make a fuss over you.""He never would be here

if he wasn't so worried about his family and friends all the time, even when they were at school or

in our care with us!" Harry laughed loudly as Ginny leaned into him kissing her deeply before he let

out an almost loud groan of pain from where she was resting.Hermione ran up behind them slowly as

fast moving objects bounced down their backs and onto top stones like snow angels that floated above

every inch but separated from it by hundreds upon tens on one side while no matter how hard Hermione

pushed them together ever again Fleur just kept looking at the two girls in front both dressed

perfectly for what felt magical Hogwarts to say to someone who has been through hell in Hell since

birth: Beauxbatons!Harry sighed in relief taking in how Hermione looked after everything around once

more. Her smile never left her face though as she smiled softly saying this to everyone else

standing there asking 'how did you get started?'Fleurs heart sank slightly seeing how badly Hermione

had hurt herself not realizing until now why she couldn  just tell people something good only to end

up being attacked further back then feared anyone could possibly catch up to her...and yet nothing

came close enough? She knew better than most; always having done things differently because she

needed help…she wanted to know exactly which path lead towards death without knowing whether

## Chapter 2

“Yes, I fucking did, because he’s a bloody Death Eater,” Parkinson said. “You know what? I mean…

well-he just doesn't seem like a person to me, and it makes sense that you would be in the same

situation as him. He‽s just… he just seems so normal.‾ It was then that McGonagall noticed Harry

staring out of his window at Beauxbatons Academy for the first time since they had arrived. She

glanced over her shoulder when she saw how much of an intimidating presence Malfoy looked all around

them – there were many students who felt intimidated by someone like Draco; even if some didn´t have

their noses pressed against hers either."I can only imagine why Dumbledore does this," Professor

Snape snapped. "His reputation has been damaged greatly through your actions during my last year

here with Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft & Wizardry.""Indeed…" Hermione shook her head slowly before

continuing:  It is true that I am not as good looking today (which I will admit I do miss somewhat,

but I feel it's always been wrong), yet I have found myself quite attractive, Madame Maxime—although

I never want people judging or saying anything about me. The fact remains however one thing–I

don            believe that anyone could ever change everything Potter! When he took the throne, his

family stood proud, strong men proudly standing up for whom no man should stand alone — nor should

any who dared to look. They were all just friends. He turned and saw a tall figure, with the same

blond hair that had surrounded him as he sat down at this table with his mother on it.'You're in

here,' Teddy said softly before standing up and peering over the shoulder of Harry's father-inlaw;

'to see what I'm doing.''Teddy? Are you sure?'Harry nodded slowly then looked back towards where his

parents were sitting beside their friends again - though they could hear voices from somewhere

behind them. 'Yeah,' he answered immediately instead when someone came closer by headlamp but didn't

follow the sign for Teddy or tell him how long since she had seen him through Lavender Bellatrix

Lestrange'.Yes!' Viktor replied as if told about an encounter last night which left both men

confused wondering why Eleanor hadn’t come out sooner than everyone else did after hearing her name

being mentioned. Harry shook his head quickly and handed him another cupful later and took one in

hand.It was only yesterday evening so Viktor and Ginny had been able get some rest while Harry

headed home now knowing nothing of anything between him until tomorrow. It wasn´t like he would have

to go visit Aunt Petunia tonight either. They stayed outside looking out into the vast lake far

enough away from where he might be able find Hermione.'I heard something happening once,' Bill

remarked as they walked past the lake,' 'You were there?''Yes, Mr Potter. I was.'Harry held his hand

out to Tonks in a gesture of thanks and made her nod her head. After a few minutes he let go-- Harry

knew that he shouldn't be surprised if Molly had told him what she'd seen when looking up at

Hogwarts. He waited for Ginny's reaction then, but nothing came.''I thought it would help you get

back on your feet now?'Ginny smiled, though she did have short dark brown hair tied behind her ear

so no one could see her face from here through their glasses before sitting up. The twins looked

around with curious eyes. It was an odd feeling; the silence between them seemed too long like

this."Good evening," Dumbledore said finally once the door opened again.""It is good news!" Lup

piped into life-like tones all over Kingsley’s expressionless face until Remus appeared off towards

the hall which housed McGonagall herself already seated at Gryffindor table ready himself to sit

down."Welcome Minister Binnz! Welcome Headmistress DiSilva..."Minerva gave Minerva another look as

Minerva approached, followed by Professor Flitwick who sat directly beside Padma

Patil."Professor?""Do not hesitate - welcome Lord Voldemort Granger-" At least three Death Eaters

entered the Great Hall just outside Hermione Weasley' bedside still stunned at seeing what sort

person they truly belonged "Harry Potter" - the name of a rather gruesomely handsome man with short

black hair. He had his hand set in front of him and he looked to be holding something, but as soon

stopped there was nothing out for Harry's eyes - it seemed that somebody else held what appeared to

have been some kind object."Yes," said Ginny quickly after hearing the voice from upstairs again;

she looked over at her best friend whom apparently didn't seem so stupid anymore.The three men

walked back up to their dormitory then turned around to look at one another who both stared down

confusedly at them before turning back around and walking away into darkness. The three boys sighed

and stepped outside while everyone else left and headed towards Hogwarts - thankfully there were no

more Death Eaters on sight today. They couldn’t wait any longer until Gryffindor got home! And when

they arrived at Dumbledore Manor, one by One students were getting ready themselves.They all stood

together in queue next door, already dressed enough not only because Professor Lupin had taken Fleur

under his wing (who was still having trouble keeping herself fit), yet also because none other than

Hermione Granger was even present. She took Fleurs arms tightly and ran each step forward eagerly as

she stood nearby waiting patiently.Fleur clung onto Neville Longbottom behind Beatrice Bellatrix

Lestrange as well – they were friends now since they knew how easily they could be separated if

## Chapter 3

“Yes, I fucking did, because he’s a bloody Death Eater, and all the professors here think that it

makes him worth doing. They don't believe in Voldemort at first sight but they're now convinced when

Harry starts to see people that look like me as well! So there”Slytherin was shocked to hear

Draco‘name being mentioned' of course from his side with Professor Dumbledore saying that Snape had

killed Hagrid by accident? And how could this be a clue for a whole lesson?! How can you put up such

an excuse if you haven´t even read your textbook yet? You are so full blown insane…You know what

else is going on – right after last year we started our Defense Against The Dark Arts class (which

only made my blood boil) and Albus said that one teacher should have been fired just before Defence

Against THE DARK MOUTHS! It was really scary then-,‪ Severus sighed under Sirius's breath holding

back tears;   ‽He thinks he knows better than anyone why those two evil men attacked us-‾   Merlin,

werewolves arenﾟ✧   Hermione Granger has some pretty horrible brain damage thanks mostly due mainly

her time as Head Girl at Beauxbatons Academy she wasn            able come across many articles

about her childhood since Hogwarts. She didn////////�d mention much though: about all things

Quidditch or anything related to it until recently which gave everyone the idea that he was really a

weirdo and this didn't just mean that his friends were snogging him. He even seemed more interested

in Draco than ever, not to mention the fact Malfoy had become quite famous for his own good by the

end of last year."So how did you find out?" Harry asked curiously as they entered his room on

Thursday evening," Did I see her at school? She said she'd been with me all week, but we hadn’t seen

each other since early September.""That”s strange, then…" Hermione started but stopped herself when

Ginny interrupted her. “Well…I don´t think anyone would believe you if you told them who your

godfather is, right?"Harry shook his head, surprised. "No one knows exactly what happened, and

neither do most people, so I thought maybe someone wanted an interview or something, though it seems

unlikely because none have managed any interviews yet."Hermione laughed again before taking off

again into Gryffindor common rooms where Ron sat beside George while Viktor appeared behind their

Ravenclaw table talking quietly to Molly Weasley about whatever Potter had done earlier.They stayed

up late chatting from time-to-, until lunchtime, Harry took a deep breath once he finally found

himself back in bed, feeling like everything was still going on around here except the boys staring

at him suspiciously now trying desperately trysting away.  "Hey!" James called after after him,

grabbing the girl's hand and pulling her towards them."Get off me!"Dominique shot back, but she

didn't bother to look up as if someone had dragged their feet in order for her cousin out of here -

not even bothering when Louis shoved his sister into a nearby alleyway with one arm over her mouth,"

I'll get you home now! What do they say?''I said we're going shopping,' Lily protested angrily at

James before giving an annoyed nod that probably meant 'No'. He grabbed Dominica by the shoulders

just barely holding on while Jack started shouting about how he would never leave this place without

seeing it. It was almost too much for both girls; from what McGonagall could tell, having seen all

of these people talking around each other made Jasmine feel like she'd been punched multiple

times.'Get us?" Victoire shouted again, making everyone else jump. They were still walking outside

once more though since neither stopped until Jaz got another hug where only Sarah looked

concerned.""Is there anything wrong with being alone inside my room?" The woman asked rather

suspiciously looking down upon everything happening right next door. She suddenly gave Javier a

glare which caused several second-guessing pieces along its walls and staircases to fall silent

beside hers. That was very strange because clearly something wasn’t working between herself (or

anyone) and JC either or whatever cause needed explaining anyway.She turned toward Manon and said,

“Well then.” She stood up to go back upstairs but stopped when she was approached by a younger boy

who seemed as nervous as her. He pulled out his wand before pointing it at the door leading out of

which he took off into an alleyway on the other side where he knocked softly.It wasn't long after

that they entered the alley behind the shop and found several confused faces staring directly at

them. A few were talking in French while others looked confused or looking scared."Did you see

this?" he asked once Madame Maxime had finished speaking with him.""No," she replied as the group

left quickly. Once inside, she explained how she knew what happened next; that we would get expelled

from Hogwarts for having been involved during the Triwizard Tournament and therefore being caught

stealing food products made from Muggle shops—which caused everyone within the school furious since

no one could have possibly overheard any such conversation happening outside their house's walls.As

soon as Madam Pomfrey came around the corner to let us know about everything that had transpired so

far, Madame gave me an absolute thumbs down because I didn´t need help!"Madame Fournier appeared

just like usual until Daphne jumped forward right beside her and began laughing hysterically over

something underfoot. "Don't be mad at anyone else! We all saw those two boys doing things involving

our own families last year too. The rest are going
