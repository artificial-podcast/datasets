'Ginny was still staring at a portrait that was unmistakably of Apolline Delacour'

## Chapter 1

Ginny was still staring at a portrait that was unmistakably of Apolline Delacour, whose face looked

like she'd been painting for months. Ginny smiled in amazement at how many people had come to her

rescue and now took to the stairs leading up towards Hogwarts School building."It's beautiful," said

Angelina as they climbed out from behind one wall into what appeared another hallway. "Do you think

I could help?""I don't know if there is anything more I can do, but I am willing To assist with any

matter that might arise.""Angelica!" Harry called as he stepped through an opening that lead into

Gryffindor tower where McGonagall sat down on his lap beside Hermione Granger who couldn’t make it

onto either side when someone opened the door. She waved to everyone sitting near them, before

dropping all of their bags away and placing the bag under Bill Weasley-""Go over to Diagon Alley,

Mrs Potter will escort us," Madam Pomfrey said quickly after Madame Maxime entered first class -

only for everybody else around Molly then heading off to greet her friends.Minerva waited outside

the main door until everyone settled back inside. As they arrived the sound went off around them

making Minerva turn slightly suspicious."Weasley! What are going on here?!"A waiter came by and

handed each student a menu with pictures depicting several famous businessmen and politicians and

celebrities including Muggle royalty suchs Arthur Boudreaux (Headmaster) and Émilie Beaumont. The

four schools held their own tournaments, but they were not bound by any rules or regulations that

would prevent them from participating in the Tournament themselves unless otherwise explicitly

approved of one another.(June 1991 - September 1992): Champions for Durmstrang are sent home to

France with an additional stipulation that all students attending Hogwarts be accompanied on the

trip so as a precaution during the time when the tournament is taking place there…(November 1994 –

February 1995: A new year begins!)A lot has changed since then. Now it was common knowledge that

each school had its own schedule to attend; what did it cost to come out to the grounds? How much

money could you make if you didn't have access while at school? And even now, almost everyone knows

about this magical world around us! It seemed that whenever something happened, people always knew

exactly how much she was spending her free time studying. But no matter who lived there anymore—even

outside Poland's borders where most girls weren’t allowed until age twelve—she still spent some time

at home. She rarely saw anyone else except those two Muggles either. Her mother wasn´t too pleased

though. Her daughter was so young and yet still very much in love after everything happening between

her parents and her brother, she couldn  believe herself that such things existed. Never having seen

Harry before, he looked up when she went back into class. "Ginny?""I thought you were in my year,"

Ginny said with a small smile."Yeah, I was!" Hermione exclaimed laughing as her friends started

talking about what had happened the night of their last meal together at Grimmauld Place this

summer; Ron and Neville exchanged hugs while Tonks sat on one side looking at Remus's face. They

laughed happily again before Harry turned to him.Harry's eyes widened slightly from confusion for

some reason that he couldn't quite place duelling; however his anger was immediately evident. He was

aware all along there would be attacks by people who could hurt them but it seemed not so easily

done away now seeing how much bigger Voldemort really is than they realized. It made sense since he

didn’t want anyone to harm any more students or teachers then everyone else did because of two

things: 1) Death Eaters being able make death threats against people like himself and 2 – non-Death

Eater students living here knew where Professor Dumbledore stood if anything were ever going

wrong.The three of us shared an uneasy feeling between ourselves. We both knew we needed somewhere

safe to hide after everything that had transpired during our time here. Of course Sirius and Minerva

had agreed upon staying behind protecting the girls until further notice whilst Lavender assured

herself they wouldn´ve been too busy keeping watch over the school these past few days. As far down

on Gryffindor table as possible only Cedric even spoke to them’s eyes.  The conversation continued

on, and then it was over – the cup had been awarded to Viktor Krum and Cedrella Malfoy by their

Headmaster who was now all but out of her reach. They were both given a small sum for helping with

his defence skills, whilst Lavender took the honour once again.Professor McGonagall stood in front

reading from an essay she had written about what she thought would be good class work; some of which

seemed more interesting than others. It didn't go very well though; Professor Moody was called upon

to help Hermione when they started talking.  She stopped short before saying “she can read this

too”, but Harry got interrupted because he couldn´t see any other students or teachers around him so

quickly that Hagrid ran into Dumbledore.He stared at Snape whom wasn-so much taller than himself (he

was probably six feet) while Minerva sat across from Gryffindors and Blaise Zabini near Slytherins

where Dean Thomas lived - still barely standing despite being used up with classes since arriving in

sixth year. ‘What are you doing here? You don-, er...‽ he began slowly before he could

finish.Hermione sighed heavily. The Hogwarts headmistress looked down as she said: "I need

time."Harry forced a smile towards Tonks and Fleur, both staring intently at each student. He felt

## Chapter 2

Ginny was still staring at a portrait that was unmistakably of Apolline Delacour, her hair in neat

waves. "You're quite beautiful."Harry sighed and let out a laugh as he reached into his pocket for

the old newspaper from the library with it's titles on top: The Princess' War Against Death Eaters;

A Guide to Surviving an Enemy-Free World In Defense Of Your Family & Friends...and One More Time!

And Another-- The Daily Prophet. This one had been buried in front only by some kind spell or

another but Harry couldn't help noticing how very familiar all those pictures were if they hadn’t

included any spells that affected magic when viewed from a distance. Ginny nodded curiously while

George looked around the room, he could see the new faces too (he supposed they would be there

now).After a brief pause, Harry closed up about half way through reading the article and started

pacing back and forth trying not to look awkward anymore. He remembered seeing this picture several

times over Christmas holidays - 'How To Get Away With Murder By Fire'; she was sitting on Potter

Manor porch and Ron was just outside her window. His eyes widened slightly once more before looking

down at them again and feeling suddenly like someone had taken ahold.'What do you mean?''No. You

can't!'He rolled off the bed and began walking towards Hermione Granger who seemed

stunned.'Hermione?' Luna asked excitedly from behind him,' She's here.''Merlin, that girl is so...'

Harry sighed. 'She doesn't know me like this.' He looked at her in amusement and then asked with a

slight frown if she was alright just now again; they'd have to go on their way before the others

could hear them say it all over themselves for hours or days after-- the whole thing had already

happened between them two minutes ago because he didn’t think there would ever be any chance of

Remus coming back into his life somehow anyway as soon did anyone else do since they had no other

choice.'I don´t understand,' Hermione said quietly but firmly once more-    “It sounds weird! I

thought you knew what your name meant!' Ron shouted.Hermione glared at herself hard enough not even

trying twice before finally shrugging. There were bits about being called Tonks which Harry noticed

were genuinely hilarious given how much Sirius liked people who didn  mean what he wanted when told

by another boy. So many things in himself, really making up to look human for what they were saying

instead leaving everything to make room for whatever happened next- though he found he wasn—well…

stuck inside forever too long.'Dobby?' Ginny stammered, looking as confused still right now out

against Luna while Lavender looked excited as well - especially considering the fact everyone except

Dobby had seen her play Hogwarts first year only last week.Harry stared at Padma whom was staring

down at him with a sad look on her face, “Do you think that we will be able to help them?”  She

smiled and looked away from Harry again as she saw the young man still wearing his wand clenched in

one hand before smiling up at Harry.They sat for just another minute or so until they felt ready but

then came back into view, this time without a word; Harry feeling tired once again after having been

given an Auror badge of confidence. He closed his eyes and listened intently as he watched his wife,

who had stepped out onto stage facing him, smile politely when she could. After greeting her family,

Ginny turned towards Draco. 'Excuse me,' said Hermione Granger.'No need! I told my mother not even

to talk about it!' replied Ron Weasley's voice through gritted teeth while Fleur gave what appeared

to have no intention other than standing by their side. The silence continued all day long and Harry

couldn't wait any longer."So did you know where our new Minister is?" asked Rita Skeeter.The blonde

girl paused looking around curiously eyeing each newcomer being picked up by Umbridge. "Yes,"

answered Lavender Greengrass gesturing to Billingham (who apparently didn´t get enough attention)

sitting next to Susan Bones whose head held some sorta photograph and Dumbledore himself looking

quite worried over its contents - which were a lot more boring than he'd expected.Bill, “If you

would like to come see me for breakfast tomorrow?”Sirius nodded, looking at the two of them. ‘Sure

thing, Mum and Dad will be back soon.’ Harry didn't even think about that one in his mind. He was so

glad it was coming over now; if he had to talk with Sirius or Remus then so much better.'Harry said,

nodding slowly to himself, but keeping his eyes on Tom as he sat down next him: 'You're going

home?'Remus looked away from her; Harry could feel it reflected back onto him, something comforting

inside him too far gone yet still warm enough not only ever being able to sit up again — no matter

how many times she'd cried out against Lily's constant insistence that it wasn´t possible anymore

because she didn''I'm sorry,' Tonks said softly by way just before letting go.''And I haven any-one

else to say anything since last time except what happened after we left Hogwarts all those years

ago. And Hermione already knows everything!' The words were a bit choked with guilt and anger but

Harry felt quite alright about accepting their apology. Removing his head, he went ahead anyway

:)When they arrived outside the Great Hall, Harry couldn' t believe the look around and couldn't

help shaking his own hand again when everyone stood there silently. They saw Professor McGonagall

walk into the room where they

## Chapter 3

Ginny was still staring at a portrait that was unmistakably of Apolline Delacour. The woman was

wearing her pyjamas, and the painting had been painted over in red ink."What is this?" Ginny asked

as she sat down on one knee with Theo's other leg wrapped around hers," It says 'Avada Kedavra' to

me.""That makes sense," said Theo curiously - "I know it was all taken from him after the war ended

- but there's no way he'd want you dead because what did you do? If something happened to you, why

would you have gone home for Christmas? You were so much better off than I am now. When we left your

house, my parents gave us everything we needed. We even got some clothes! That wasn't really enough,

Mum!""Didn’t you get anything else?!" Bill asked sarcastically before sitting up straight again

suddenly shaking his head slightly."No," answered Hermione quietly through clenched teeth while

trying not look uncomfortable when Draco lifted his hand away once more revealing his own black

robes without batting an eye or paying attention until they both disappeared.Hermione made herself

appear under Harry who looked a little confused by where his hands might be. She didn´t think much

about how these things could possibly work; maybe they worked together somehow, though... Perhaps

someone here knew Voldemort and therefore told them exactly whom took him to Azkaban, instead

murdering him himself."So what are you doing here?" she asked, her voice shaking slightly. "What is

going on? Why were you out there with that snake in my house after the attack!?"Teddie looked over

at Marcus and his friends as they continued their discussion of what had happened to him. The first

thing he noticed was how pale Marcus seemed; with a bit more hair than usual around his face but no

obvious scars. It made Tearing it down a little easier since only one person could see this," She

shrugged again," I've been talking to an Auror who said something about me being a Death Eater

before now.""She's not telling us anything either," Derrick said, leaning back against his

pillow.Tears welled up inside his eyes as he stared at the ground where the Ministry officials were

standing. He couldn't help taking a deep breath as if Harry Potter hadn’t taken any chances by

attacking them or even pretending like everything was okay. But then he remembered asking why

Voldemort would want the man dead for once; wouldn´ve ever given him the opportunity to kill someone

else without risking harm. What really struck Derrick was the way Malfoy suddenly appeared near his

room."You think we can trust him?" Marcus asked. "Maybe!" Blaise said slowly while trying hard get

away from Derrick when the boy rolled onto his side.The other four Slytherins joined in, laughing

loudly through laughter mixed into muffled noises until Mason turned to see the wolf sitting on his

bed. He was dressed in a white top hat and red trousers with a grey vest over his thick black robes.

The wolf sniffed as he sat down beside him, snuggling onto his knees."Thank you," he whispered

softly."Mason," said Astoria soothingly but then she could hear whispers of laughter echoing from

upstairs that night. She had never seen someone so happy before. As they walked downstairs again it

became clear what their next steps would be and how much longer this lay. They were both exhausted

as well after almost three months together; more than anything else, for Merlin's sake, did these

two have to take out some homework now?"Have you done any work yet?" asked Jasmine as soon as they

entered the room to find them already asleep."I haven't worked at all lately," Teddie replied,

standing up straight. "The first task is really important.""You'll miss your OWLs!" Mason

teased.Tears pooled in her eyes immediately as though they were holding back tears like water. It

was nearly midnight when James suddenly arrived inside the common room.He looked suspiciously around

Harry Potter who quickly made himself known. After leaving Dumbledore there, Daphne had hurried past

saying, “So I came here tonight to look for Theo.”Dumbledore chuckled slightly only moments later

and stood looking at Sirius about thirty minutes later.Sirius rolled his eyes. “You’re still here,

then? I can see you doing alright,” he said slowly and Harry nodded. Sirius sat up quickly so that

they didn't miss anything from the conversation in front of them again."I think we should head back

to Gryffindor Tower," Remus told him as they exited. "Remus isn´t going anywhere.""We probably need

a place for James or Lily out of all people, right?""Lily is definitely fine at Beauxbatons because

she knows me very well enough not only by my past achievements but also her relationship with

Hermione who‽s been dating Lupin since last year when Jasmine was seven years old! She thinks that

she could use some help finding James and making love sometime soon and Lily wouldn-,""Maybe it

would be better if we went into Slytherins instead?" Tonks asked hopefully after listening intently

over dinner before heading off down to breakfast. Harry was completely oblivious yet somehow decided

on skipping breakfast too. It had been almost three hours long but he knew there were things he

needed answers around, especially regarding why this whole situation wasn-  Harry was still

incredibly confused. He hadn - indeed – gotten rid himself entirely once he found out what happened

to everyone else on top Hogwarts House which was no secret even though he certainly knew half their

secrets from their parents (and Ron too).He had just finished eating lunch where
