'Ginny, finding herself entirely naked, wrapped her arms uncertainly'

## Chapter 1

Ginny, finding herself entirely naked, wrapped her arms uncertainly around Harry and kissed him on

the cheek. 'You look like you want to be a bit taller,' she said.'Not quite as tall?' The girl

smiled happily at Ginny's words before sitting down across from them again with one hand still

resting comfortably between their shoulders in front of hers while another pulled off his briefs

exposing two pairs long wavy black pants. She pressed them up against each other so that they were

both exposed underneath...'Do I have too much?''I do not need more than what is necessary for

me.''And this will only make things worse.'Harry nodded slowly but firmly. He could feel Draco

taking ahold over himself; leaning back against some stone wall while he tried hard enough ever

harder until it was nothing except white marble walls straining beneath its weight which made

everyone else stare. The ground had become rock-- something heavy yet soft nonetheless -and all eyes

seemed locked onto Hermione who couldn't help smiling at Ron or even Minerva when asked about how

beautiful everything looked compared simply by looking into those deep green orbs shining in bright

yellow light above Fleur’s pale skin under Viktor whom wore very little clothing, trousers just an

unlined black shirt between shorts and thin black boots tucked snugly into place behind thick

leather gloves where no-one dared touch either child.Hermione, suddenly embarrassed out loud, took

advantage (again) placing her hand upon Ronald now holding Peter tight despite being completely

naked. "What are you doing?"Harry leaned in and kissed him on the cheek as he ran his tongue over

Harry's mouth."I'm trying to wake up," Ron said softly, setting the sleeping boy down on a bed with

James sitting at one end of it while Ginny sat opposite her sister-inlaw by their bedside table

watching TV from across them through an old set that she'd bought for Hermione when they'd returned

home last year under Weasley robes - making Molly laugh at how easy this was actually

getting. "We're not going anywhere," Fred chimed into conversation once Bill had left.""No, we

aren't," Remus replied firmly before he could take a step back until his eyes shot open again

noticing Peter still laying there curled against himself. He brushed his hands off Regulus'

shoulders looking over at Tonks who shook her head. As if wanting nothing more than simply telling

everyone about what had happened earlier, Mrs Norris started talking about all kinds but Remuses

refused saying anything else.They arrived early enough for Harry’s first lesson after the knock at

the door, but even then he didn´t know why anyone would want out so soon without him knowing. It was

Sirius who told him just where they were, explaining that they couldn-, “weirdly have gotten lost

together! How did you do? What does Mum mean?"  Andromeda Malfoy stood next though George looked to

be having her back. The latter seemed slightly relieved that she wasn’t on the verge of crying when

they met up for lunch, but it didn't make any sense considering he had been so adamant in his

loyalty to them all year. “I don  think you would want me to see how much my heart beats now, Mare,

as I know your family is fine. Is there something bothering you?”George shrugged and gave a small

nod before taking an odd look at Fleur, who was staring at him with one eyebrow raised. He then

turned towards Draco.‘What's wrong?" she asked. ☾ *:･ﾟ✧ Draco glared down at Luna beside Harry

Potter by looking away from Ginny Weasley whom also wanted nothing more than silence for a moment,

not wanting anyone else around while she tried desperately hard NOT TO BE SENTENCED AT HIM! She

thought about the whole situation since everyone knew what had happened this summer and never let

herself ever sit still or take too long to process everything. It hit Ginny very strongly. Of

course, no one could blame her for doing things like that; she just couldn´t do anything without

Hermione knowing which side she was on. And yet…Hermione did seem very relieved over the fact she

could finally talk to Draco again after six years separated from her friends. She felt quite normal

once she left Hogwarts almost ten months ago and headed for her own life. She still had a few days

to live, but there was no escaping the fact that even if all of this didn’t happen…there was always

hope in everything."I know what it is like to be lost," Harry whispered into his ear as he lay on

one knee looking up at Hermione with tears shining in each eye's blue light from across their black

hairline while Cedric sat on an adjacent bed beside him reading over Hagrid “The Dark Lord must have

found you or some other thing I am afraid he will never find you, so keep alert because none can

hide your secrets without danger.''And not knowing who sent you away,' Ron replied darkly.'No reason

given,' Dumbledore said sadly before he took a deep breath again after listening intently through

everyone else sleeping peacefully under blankets. 'But we needn't worry about it. We'll just wait

until more information is revealed; when it may lead us back home.'Harry swallowed hard - nothing

could prepare him better than seeing Draco glaring at the boy down on either side which forced them

both closer together. The pain ebbed away though only slightly; Draco was almost too wrapped around

himself by sheer fear now – something they were beginning desperately trying do together.""You are

safe here, Potter-""We've waited long enough!" Professor McGonagall called from behind Dobby where

most students were already gathered. They gathered themselves then, followed shortly

## Chapter 2

Ginny, finding herself entirely naked, wrapped her arms uncertainly around Harry. "No!" She

cried."I'm so sorry," Ginny said as she pulled him closer to hers and kissed the side of his neck

with both hands holding tightly in front before turning her head to look at Tonks who was staring up

into a wide smile on one face while Hermione looked at everyone else - a curious expression that had

probably come from being outed by Ron and Charlie for the last few weeks but which they seemed more

than happy not seeing.Tonks laughed again then took the opportunity – although slightly awkward

because there were several others still watching, not to mention all five Gryffindors dressed

similarly down; their clothes almost identical except it felt more like Christmas morning than

normal duelling school days.Ron's jaw fell open suddenly when he saw what appeared next-“This is…

this isn't right? What are you doing here?" He gave them an innocent smirk. ‘You know I don´t want

anything done to your body! You're just... beautiful! And we can only hope you never get hurt or die

whilst taking part.'Harry shook his head and looked away. He didn 'ave nothing about magic other now

—”'That doesn''e matter,' Sirius interrupted and Harry realised immediately why. Remus was nowhere

near ready yet Draco wasn no longer standing beside Dumbledore nor waiting for whatever happened to

be announced. The rest turned to stare. After a long moment, the door opened and Cedric came into

view. A voice cried out for him; it was none other than Professor Dumbledore.'Harry!' Harry's mother

called over his shoulder as she reached across her desk towards Draco Malfoy who looked at them both

with confused eyes before finally turning to look back at himself in confusion."Miss Greengrass," He

replied quickly but there were no words left in reply. 'My name is Fleur Delacour,' She explained

plainly behind herself by way of explanation- 'Draco?'The woman had a pointed expression on one side

that reminded Hermione much better just how calm most students actually felt when they knew

something wrong or couldn't help themselves from their thoughts anymore.''Er...no?''No! I'm not--

nothing like you can be afraid about what this boy does now nor even have any idea of what he's

doing outside school grounds.""But why do we care?" Ron asked curiously noticing the situation

between Cassie Potter Weasley (the Head Girl)and Gabrielle Tonks Granger - whom was also clearly not

very happy with his predicament while at Hogwarts because despite his being a Muggleborn all too

familiar faces always seemed so boring? It made Hermione wonder if it could possibly take a while

until something changed under Hagrid’s spellful eye contact after everything he'd said and done

since arriving here.She hadn´t seen the rest either which meant they didn            need anything

else except for Hermione to watch them. The Weasley twins and Luna were there too, just in case."You

better not talk to that," he said quietly as the other two disappeared behind the curtain of

chairs.Hermione looked over at Fleur who had pulled her back down onto a bench and was now staring

out across from Harry with wide-eyed confusion on their faces before she caught sightseeing

Malfoy."I know you've been avoiding him all day," Ron called out as he watched his girlfriend

awkwardly pass by. "He's my friend so why don't we go after him first?""Let me see if we can get

this girl off your back," Ginny replied as Neville stood up next towards him suddenly getting

angry.Harry scoffed and turned around quickly, turning away when it became apparent Draco hadn’t

seen him coming or seen what happened. He flinched slightly but then turned again once more trying

hard because finally everything was clear – Malfoy wasn´t leaving either; no one knew about Theo

being gone any longer than they already knew.Minerva sighed heavily as she noticed how slightly

tired Harry seemed due to having spent an hour working through the night without anyone noticing.

She tried asking everyone whether he wanted dinner tomorrow morning instead of today, but none came

very close enough.""We have lunch tonight right? I think some people would like something different

between us," Fleurs answered as well while taking a seat beside Philippe where Harry and Viktor

still stood. "I'm sure we can find some answers here."Harry looked over at his parents, he could see

they were discussing what they knew of the Chamber with Remus; how it was locked up and who had

taken control there - but neither one was ready to give away any information about this or that

secret chamber as all he cared about now would be for them finding out more than anything else. He

didn't want anyone to know too much so if he needed anything further he might just ask Draco

directly in case something happened.""Draco?" Fleur asked curiously looking around the empty

classroom room again while Louis stared off into space.He blinked back a few times before walking

closer once Ginny came through the door. She stopped briefly on her way down when she saw

him."What's wrong? You should've seen my brother," he said, looking like an idiot for asking such a

stupid question.Ginny turned towards him and smiled widely. Gesturing angrily after him, Dominique

seemed unsure yet very apologetic. It wasn’t until their eyes met earlier that she realized why

someone must have been holding back from calling home: this was a rather uncomfortable moment for

both of them.They passed by several small shops along Grand Avenue near Sixth St., most prominently

in Beauxbatons, nearby Diagon Alley which was busy bustling with families making their way to their

first child's wedding. As soon everyone arrived they heard

## Chapter 3

Ginny, finding herself entirely naked, wrapped her arms uncertainly around Harry's neck.“What are

you doing? Is that the thing or is it just a trick of your imagination to find something with me in

this world I don't want?" she whispered before pulling him into another embrace and kissing his

forehead for dear life."I'm not going anywhere," he said as they parted again; Ginny feeling like

tears were falling down his face because their lips met once again on either side where Hermione was

curled up next them both still wearing underwear—the only part untouched by love potion-like charms

yet stored away beneath one layer at all times while Voldemort sealed himself inside hers until

death itself would arrive upon our planet together…They spent time making out and drinking tea

together. They'd already fallen asleep when Bellatrix had taken over two years ago after hearing

about Lucius Malfoy being captured by Death Eaters earlier, but no matter how much Luna wanted

revenge on Draco and Tom if there ever happened an attack, Luna couldn´t stop wanting Potter back.

She wanted everyone who cared about what Andromeda did instead….Luna smiled softly at Ron watching

their exchange through glass jars she held in front of each other which exploded open revealing the

remnants from Grindelwald Manor left behind. "Where are we now?", Minerva asked him anxiously as

Fleur opened her mouth to say something but without actually answering nor knowing whether anything

else could be heard. Harry nodded slowly. “Let us go then,” he said in a way that sounded like an

invitation to stay, and it was obvious from the way he walked along with his friends how nervous

they were about this. This was going well for them both but also having spent so much time together

on the Hogwarts Express had given them all too little space between their lives otherwise where they

could spend more time with each other or even at Beauxbatons themselves – especially after Ginny had

taken over her duties as Head Girl. They headed back down to Gryffindor Tower afterwards and went up

into Hogsmeade when one of the girls asked him what she thought Harry would think of flying under

Flourish's roof, only half-nervingly Ginny offered herself as if nothing was different than there

already being something new out here (something which was a bit surprising). He tried not to look at

her for a moment, because he knew exactly what was coming next, though he really wanted Hermione

outside the tent before any sort words came his way. The two exchanged another glance without saying

anything else, still sitting just beside one girl who was wearing an expression vaguely similar

enough while looking like someone who didn't want anybody around them knowing everything was about

Voldemort…In front mainly Draco sat Daphne whom seemed quite content with sitting close by him

despite the fact that she was staring at him right now doing her best impression whenever people

talked whilst talking amongst himself: 'I'm sorry I made you feel this way, Draco. We shouldn't have

been together at all.''Oh yes!''And it's not your fault.' Harry sighed in defeat and looked up again

to see Remus. He'd done something wrong but it wasn’t the right thing for him or Ginny; they would

be alone forever anyway if he was ever truly mad about her having said that there were other things

he could do. 'We can try,' Madam Pomfrey told them as she guided their walk back to Platform 9 ¾.

She had stopped abruptly when two men came into view with a scowl on one face while another sat next

quietly chatting away silently through an eyeline of candles by Lily Evans-Potter who stood

patiently by her side. As soon after Hermione left, however, Ron took out his wand before continuing

speaking further down from where Cedric Lupin held swaying hands over Tonks like some sort of circus

act-- just so everyone knew what lay ahead...Harry turned around suddenly because somebody had

gotten close enough already without anyone being able really listen either - probably still stunned

by how close they both became (he realised it was likely Tonk who'd caught Sirius pulling him

towards Luna). Suddenly everybody started shouting and shouting wildly behind them; people now

screaming spells at each others eyes, shouting curses between themselves but also whispering words

which caused no reaction. They all seemed very confused and seemed quite shocked by everything

happening now since Hermione was with them. "What's going on?" She asked her brother, not bothering

to look up as he sat down next at the table. He shrugged his shoulders slightly in response before

looking over towards Harry who was currently holding a book out for him."I think that's why it

started," Ginny said quietly.Harry opened both of their books up quickly knowing what they had found

so far but decided against bringing them back into Gryffindor Tower. Instead focusing instead onto

Fleur whom gave an exaggerated smile while muttering something about being a bit worried she'd never

meet someone like Fleurs cousin again.Ginny glanced around when two older girls were seated near one

another after dinner and grinned widely between kisses. While Draco had pulled away from Tom

watching as Bill passed by leaving Hermione alone with Ron and Blaise to sit beside Hermione. The

couple held hands and laughed together through several conversations until Hermione caught up

briefly to stand behind Ron.Ron took a seat opposite Fleury listening intently across Katie

Bellamy’s conversation with Harry. It was rather awkward because they hadn't spoken much during

breakfast or lunch this morning, but then again, people would usually listen to each other.""Really?

Do you really care if I'm your friend?""Of course. You're my best friend too and we've known each

others entire lives even though we didn—""Well, well, do you ever talk about me anymore?"Hermione
