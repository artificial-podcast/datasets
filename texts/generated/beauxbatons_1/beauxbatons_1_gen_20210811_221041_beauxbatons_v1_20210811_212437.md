## Chapter 1

“I understand the difference,” she said then.  “Between your portrait and mine.  I am unfortunately

dead for being an Auror now… but you are still a good person who could have done more to improve on

my life.  You were one of the first people we met at Beauxbatons…  Now, when you come here, it will

be your own place to sit alone.   If any need arises, please call me before breakfast. - The next

day was no different from last time; in fact everything was fine. It wasn't like everyone was

complaining about her – there had been some that seemed too proud with their performance or even

that they'd made progress towards correcting something that needed fixing. Some were even taking

pleasure themselves by saying that Ginny should be thanking Ava all over again because they've only

just started seeing each other. However much they wished the other Champions would meet up longer

anyway (not that either of them ever did), neither Beatrix nor Shannon complained as well about

their performances, which simply meant that Fleur was getting better every single night. Of course

the rest found it easier than usual since both Beatrice's workload rose dramatically despite her

showing off to most, although if anyone saw how clearly Camila treated Lilith, none would mind

having her back sooner, especially considering what happened between JC after he left school. As

always, though: When someone asked why Arthur had stopped helping out during his break, Hermione

replied to that with a soft smile.“What about the first task? Do you know how many people have been

sent here for this one? And if so… what did it even entail? I mean, who would want to compete at

Hogwarts or in France like Durmstrang and Beauxbatons had already done over there?”Hermione was

silent as she spoke before answering, ‘Well those are all questions we can answer right now.  We

will be arriving back on Wednesday afternoon when our exams start tomorrow. A few of my fellow

Gryffindors were very excited by the chance they could enter their houses again – especially after

seeing Harry Potter return from abroad recently. It wasn't really an issue he'd considered; still in

high spirits every morning waking up early each morning wishing he could take part too!’  She

continued speaking much longer than necessary but not coming across any more words.'So far,' Draco

said with some amusement then interrupted them both, pausing momentarily to admire Harry's face

before smiling warmly at her softly asking, 'Didn´t try to ask him?'‴No, no he didn't!' he

protested, just as he watched his best friend move away laughing - and quite frankly, confused, not

surprised by anything he saw happening behind these two smiles which had made him think he was

telling himself he couldn wait anymore and took advantage enough today without breaking eye

contact.Harry gave her a smile. "Thank you."The two walked back up to the carriage and Harry cast

his own wand, casting another charm on it before returning to Grimmauld Place with Ginny's trunk

behind him as well - he had planned for both of them in there when they would meet again after

dinner.""So, how was your morning?" Fleur asked as she looked over at Ron while he readied himself

to head out onto Platform 9 ¾ next door," Is everything okay? I have my things ready already."Ron

shook his head, "I should probably go get some breakfast later then before we leave so I can check

myself into potions or something like that.""I'm not sure what else to do besides just going about

doing research tomorrow afternoon," Hermione said, looking around curiously. She smiled at Blaise

who nodded slightly.Hermione paused beside where Ron sat waiting. Her eyes widened seeing Bill and

Charlie coming towards them from across the room. Bill smirked down at Daphne and George, both

watching their friend walk by. He saw his friends pass through the Great Hall which made everyone

nod their heads together.After getting off work early (which meant leaving extra time), Fred and

Sarah headed straight upstairs. As soon any one person approached Harry she suddenly felt his hand

on hers but turned away quickly once she realized why. Harry noticed this too."Hey!" Harry called

walking past them all.They were greeted enthusiastically with several smiles on their faces, before

Hermione and Ron both burst out laughing at the pair of them."How are you doing?" Harry asked as he

watched his friends laugh in front him from across a table," I'm alright."Ron smiled back at him

before turning to look at Harry, who was grinning too when suddenly Draco Malfoy's face lit up again

– this time it made his eyes widen a bit as well!"You're going away for Christmas! And now there is

no reason not being here any longer!" The blonde boy exclaimed as they left after hearing

that. "That makes sense - we'll be staying forever together." His girlfriend smiled sadly while Ron

laughed softly; she had been so happy about meeting her new boyfriend since last night; it seemed

like such an odd thing but what better way than spending holidays alone? They arrived outside the

Great Hall then took off through Lavender Brown's door which caused Harry quite some friction

between himself trying desperately hard break free of Ginny Weasley's grip around his neck."Do you

want me home?" He asked with those wide lips kissing his sister-in law goodbye once again.She nodded

slowly slightly peering over her shoulder towards where the other two girls were waiting chatting

about something else; the Champions' Cup match against Beauxbatons Academy. That day during the

Tournament she'd almost stormed into the castle knowing full well Potter was behind on everything;

even though things hadn't changed much either and if anything Potter had gotten

## Chapter 2

“I understand the difference,” she said then.  “Between your portrait and mine.  I am unfortunately

dead to you.  Yes?The man who had put me down was quite fond of my hair now – he had been in love

with a woman long before we left school; after I had finished school… And all this time there wasn't

much about him that could be described as anything but affectionate or loving towards her other than

an open expression on his face which I found most unpleasant for what it did not mean: tenderness

within himself! But if someone wanted their daughter-inlaw's happiness they would have done

something differently...  There were so many things wrong here because Harry Potter is such good at

nothing - and none more wonderful yet does everything right when one doesn´t want any part

whatsoever from his life anymore.'Draco considered Harry briefly for a minute longer,'Then why

should anyone care?'He paused again, and thought back over how little Draco knew of others besides

those around them whom seemed interested by certain things beyond themselves — only curious once

more (and a few more times) when somebody else tried taking another step forward. 'But don-, oh no!'

Hermione protested, looking away.'And yes, well perhaps people aren''e'er to ask us like that

yourself.''You might suggest you do something even though it would be easier without it being

written into our records anyway. You know very clearly—but first let see whether I can keep it

together.”She grinned, but he didn't look too pleased to hear that. “I think you have some ideas for

the next task. I'm going with Harry Potter as your partner now? That would be great! And there is a

third girl… well she's got a name already, isn't her name Malfoy?"He nodded his head and reached out

just in time."Well," Draco said when they were both standing up. "Thank Merlin I don´t need my hair

done so soon. The whole school is starting on me.""That sounds lovely!" Ginny exclaimed happily from

behind him while everyone else laughed around them; everyone was excited about their new friends at

Hogwarts or other magical schools that were still looking after them rather than the girls

themselves who had always been close by because of this tournament being over long term marriage

vows between parents leaving them all in shock. Hermione even hugged Ginny tightly before hugging

her husband one last bit more. Harry turned back to face Hermione. He could see tears in front

almost immediately following their eyes which he caught again. 'You are wonderful,' Ron told Fleur

as Arthur followed suit.'And did you know we won the Tournament?' Tonks asked suddenly moving into

bed beside Dumbledore herself helping Remus write up what information he knew for how much longer

the Task should take.The twins seemed surprised at seeing Hermione come forward like two hours ago.

A smile spread across Fred Weasley blushed at the thought of being in love with a Muggle-born. She

had been so happy that Christmas Eve he’d started to see her, but she wasn't sure what she was

planning on doing next.She glanced over and saw Hermione Granger walking up behind them in front by

their bedside table as they returned from the bathroom together."Hermione?" Fred asked."Yeah," Harry

said slowly coming around the corner.""Good morning, Professor Flitwick!" Ron greeted him before

turning back to Hermione's side giving his best friend an enthusiastic kiss for good measure while

sitting down beside Ginny softly kissing her on top form one arm through hers - "Have you seen my

Mum lately? She's probably busy this week…I'm afraid I am not getting any answers right now. Is your

father still here?""Of course he is! He just left yesterday without saying anything or even talking

about anything," Bill explained quietly," He doesn´t think we should worry too much because it is

going well since last time…"George looked confused when a sudden hush fell over the entire room

causing everyone else all round Hogwarts including Ginny who smiled slightly nervously under George

“So where have you gone? Won there be another trip planned during the summer?"Ginny nodded knowing

full well nothing would happen between school holidays; therefore, no matter how many times Tonks

mentioned that she needed some extra help helping these days, none ever came along. They were in

France and the other three didn’t know much about it, but they had heard a lot of stories from their

friends as well – some of which he could tell to them when Harry was home. It was good for him now

that Draco couldn't have any doubts about what he would find out later.Harry Potter never went away,

so why should this be different?The first time someone saw him in the Great Hall during lunch he had

spent several months trying not only on his Quidditch training abilities (he hadn´t done anything

yet, he really thought about going into house-elves),but also how important things like teamwork or

concentration might become. A few months before Christmas he was sitting with Astoria at her side

talking excitedly about playing Hogwarts. He felt a little sad over something, and wanted nothing

more than Hermione Granger around to cheer him up.At least after two years no one else knew exactly

where he stood in relation towards people; just who he truly believed in most…Draco didnnon still

remember seeing him today, or even mentioning it there in class. But everything changed because

suddenly he remembered being Harry's date to Harry Malfoy; an Auror, right next door!He smiled

faintly despite himself and nodded proudly toward Draco, waiting for all those unfamiliar faces whom

werenned in front by Neville Longbottom. 'It was great to see you again, love,' Ron

greeted.'Thanks,'

## Chapter 3

“I understand the difference,” she said then.  “Between your portrait and mine.  I am unfortunately

dead as soon you leave Hogwarts.  That is why they don't have a living soul anymore… but there is no

way to be truly alive without one person in it! And here we are! You have found a new home for me –

a life that will last forever with you even if this world has gone too far towards keeping us apart!

Now let's see what happens when the time comes! The next task won´t start until tomorrow evening, so

please take care of yourselves before asking anyone else or something. Do not forget to put on

makeup - all that matters is that you live up to my expectations! May God bless you all! Phew… Miss

Weasley, Cedric Diggory, Fleur Delacour-Potter Headmistress: Madame Pomfrey (Headmaster): Professor

McGonagall; Harry Potter School Map Number 78888 This piece from Mr Crouch Jr contains information

about Hermione Granger being sorted into Gryffindor Quidditch team at Durmstrang Academy over the

summer holidays. It was discovered during an interview by Neville Longbottom earlier today that he

had been referring specifically toward Slytherin – which would explain where his comments were

coming from. The article itself states further than any other piece of information regarding Mrs

Malfoy, that although her first name means "Lovely" rather frequently these days many people

associate with the other Champions. When you had been chosen, no one could have predicted what would

happen in your place on this team and it was clear that she didn't want you to be part of the

problem."Dominique sighed as they walked up to the table where Louis was currently sitting listening

intently. "I don’t know if I ever wanted a champion like him back," he said slowly before opening

his mouth again at her words but not so quietly because Domini knew how loud those words sounded

through their ears. He wasn´t exactly used for polite conversation or even casual chatter when

someone made such an accusation about something trivial—like James Potter being involved.""They

never asked me questions?" Sarah repeated after several seconds, now taking another sip from her

wine. She took both hers while still looking over Jack's shoulder. It almost felt like everyone else

were talking about them lately; especially given everything happening around them. That might

explain why there were two sets coming together tonight…but only once did Javier ask which pair are

going to make history by claiming first overall selection? The others seemed too focused already on

themselves to notice anymore than usual.Louis just let out a sigh despite himself. His posture was

steady enough without anyone noticing who pulled down Cedric Diggory yet couldn be bothered trying

either until all four champions approached eachothers and began exchanging notes. From across the

room nobody paid much attention to anything except random whispers overheard by your friends.  All

of you,” he said, and the trio all took their seats across from him on either side in front as they

passed each other, watching them closely. “I didn't see a single bloody thing happening until now,

did I? Is that what this is about…’ He paused for a moment, scanning over his surroundings. Why was

it so important that we were here? What kind or why hadn´t you noticed us yet?' Draco had no idea

where Daphne would be headed; she was always out with her family or at the castle, but not lately;

after spending some time together since sixth year when her parents had returned home again (and

being invited back once more). His eyes were focused solely upon the girls in Ravenclaw—the girl who

had just been attacked by an angry Black, a boy named Bellatrix Lestrange whom he knew only vaguely

enough under various names because if she had known one-by-, then she probably wouldn' have even

mentioned her name—while he watched the others sit nearby, looking curiously around at each else

before he shook his head and looked away. It was clear though how many times Harry had asked Snape

whether he could let anyone enter Hogwarts without permission. 'It doesn''ve happened,' Harry told

himself slowly.'No!' Remus shouted, hurrying forward and slamming into Minerva McGonagall to face

off against another Death Eater. They'd fought in the Quidditch World Cup and had taken part at

several other tournaments, but Harry wasn't sure they could keep up with this one. "Harry?" Ginny

asked softly as she sat beside him."Yes," said Daphne quietly when Tonks followed her back into

their room after she had left for work on Saturday morning that evening - a small group of students

were sitting in front Neville's study and waiting patiently while his father was getting ready an

appointment. He leaned over to where Harry stood and kissed Hermione passionately before stepping

away from them quickly once he heard them.'Why are you here?' Remus turned to look at Andromeda whom

looked between himself deadpan,'It is because I need your help again now.''Please let me go fetch

Tonk-''I know it would be a great pleasure if we can come find Harry,' Sirius replied calmly; 'but…

please don’t get angry or hurt any more than you think is necessary. If there will ever even been

someone who would want us all killed...please stop crying about how badly we have fallen under

Voldemort just yet — no matter how many times we tried fighting those Dark Wizards!'Tonks shook her

head silently. She didn really want people dying anymore—and not being able make it worse by using

magic seemed like such nonsense anyway! But then again everyone in Hogwarts thought so too much

alike: What kind did Dumbledore say? 'We cannot
