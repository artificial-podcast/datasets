'Hermione went to answer but was abruptly cut off as Draco took one of her'

## Chapter 1

Hermione went to answer but was abruptly cut off as Draco took one of her hands in his own. “Can you

feel the warmth?”Harry nodded and pulled Hermione up so she could sit on a chair opposite him,

sitting down beside Malfoy with them both. He looked over at Harry as they sat there silently for

some time before finally speaking."Do not forget to wear your school colours," he said quietly while

pointing out three other areas where Ginny had probably hidden the necklace.Draco groaned slightly

at that statement once more when Ron asked, "What do we do if someone shows us the real thing?""If

anyone tries or asks about it without me taking care first then they will be punished," Neville

replied angrily.Ginny laughed weakly as she watched him curiously. The others chuckled softly

knowing they would need answers later. It seemed like everything was going well until Malfoy came

around and pointed into another room. After a moment's thought what should have been done

differently than what he did, they decided against it. They all waited until everyone else had left

their beds while looking around frantically for their mates who were leaving.They each headed

straight back inside, muttering something underhand whilst Draco made a mental note how much it

bothered Harry especially since they knew last night he wouldn't come home again after this.The next

morning, Harry woke up with bruises all over the skin from previous days having happened just

moments ago; scars that had been covering the corners below his eyes. He didn’t even look like a

normal human anymore, as he was only using one eye to focus on Harry's face; it just so happened

they were both in different rooms. At first Draco felt stupid for not taking Harry into

consideration when evaluating their dormitories or other things involving him and all of this stuff

being about them over dinner because Potter seemed  jealous. Draco couldn't help but feel guilty

about it, but at least now he knew why. It would be better than going back to Gryffindor Tower with

an empty bed and no one else around after class ended already (except Harry). The end result still

didn´t sound good enough either.When Draco got up from the couch towards Snape who sat across from

you, he noticed your owl sitting beside your arm next-to-the-headboard facing away from him. “Hey

there!”You shook your head sadly before continuing down through the door leading inside once

again…It wasnn—‘a few seconds later'“Erm...‧‽But I don-,‾‿No, stay here,‣ said Snape almost

instantly while trying desperately hard yet failing miserably.Snape snorted quietly under his breath

then moved forward slowly until he reached out to grab whatever piece laid upon the desk behind

yours. Draco took it easily, though looking rather surprised by the mere sensation of it. You could

feel her arms around you, holding you close and whispering with you as she pulled away from you.

“I’m sorry… I didn't mean to hurt that girl.” She shifted slightly on her knees then stood up again

for a moment before speaking softly, ‘I don´t think we should say anything more about this now. It‽s

just something between us will be okay after everything happens. And not even if there are any

repercussions or consequences – no matter how much they hurt me!‘She nodded slowly but clearly

inching closer until your body was pressed against hers gently while their hands each held one

another still. Inhaling deeply at his words Severus set them down beside him watching Albus sleep

peacefully through the night behind Sirius‼Draco sighed heavily when he saw Harry lay curled into

his side next to Hermione. He had been crying like a baby all morning; trying desperately hard

pushing himself back out of bed so that he could focus and maybe get some rest during classes

instead….He rested atop Draco's shoulders looking across the room wondering what Hadrian would do

once he realised Dumbledore wasn—? An hour later Riddle stormed off leaving Minerva behind hoping to

help Ginny find whoever brought him to Hogwarts first. Her absence seemed greatly appreciated though

perhaps having seen Viktor storming past Krum almost five hours ago reminded him of the lost day

earlier.....Remus sat near the fireplace where the students were preparing for their classes. He

smiled as he watched them take in what they had been doing at Hogwarts."Why do you ask?" Harry

asked, sitting up straight and looking around curiously.""I didn't know why I wanted to," Remused

him with a shrug before turning back toward his book again after looking over it slightly more

carefully. "But maybe that's just how we made our way here. It was not always like that. We've all

got things going on behind closed doors when people are busy or bored; but sometimes it doesn’t seem

so bad when someone is actually there, and everyone is getting close enough without us noticing that

they're being too aggressive.""It isn´t exactly the same as if this place had changed much since

last year," James said matter-of-, factually while Ginny was still worried about her brother

constantly threatening him.Removing one of Lily Evans from her seat, Sirius led Albus into an

adjoining room which contained several chairs arranged like miniature Quidditch pitches—with small,

light colored candles floating above each hole depicting his favourite team (which he

wasn            sure who) during the match between Slytherin vs Gryffindor, the second task taking

off once more every day until dinner ended. The two boys stood down beside Bill Weasley talking

excitedly towards Professor McGonagall who was seated next to Lucius Malfoy whom also looked

nervous. Harry sat by Minerva curiously watching

## Chapter 2

Hermione went to answer but was abruptly cut off as Draco took one of her hand in his. He stood, and

Hermione held the other close. "You needn't worry about me," she whispered."I'm fine!" Ron said with

a smile on both cheeks when he saw that Harry had been sitting with them all day instead (noticing

how Draco had lost track) while trying not make eye contact or blush at their antics over lunch

earlier this morning -"Draco…" As Hermione turned away from him again – Professor McGonagall came

into view beside Leona's headboard with two large boxes; each one weighing just under twenty-five

kilos which Harry carried around in an easy pouch. She pointed to every single box before asking,

'What are you doing here?'The two witches were rather surprised by Malfoy’s lackadaisical mannerisms

at this point: They could just recognise his face and the smirk they had felt towards him during the

walk across Hogwarts grounds after dinner. All three of these boys looked quite shocked, but

surprisingly pleased at being able help themselves for such short periods without Hermione

noticing. After eating, however—a very interesting fact since they hadn´t eaten breakfast yet —they

made their way back to where they‘d been last night—an empty classroom in front… There would be no

professors there now, so they decided it best if everyone stayed seated until the end because it

wouldn “scare people' out�?” Harry mused.  The sound of his footsteps reverberated through the

castle, and he heard Draco’s familiar voice calling him ‘Draco Malfoy! You are here to kill me!! I

am afraid this is not your way… He shook his head at that last word but smiled.  He was sure he

would be better off in hiding for now because if Voldemort wanted a place with good reason, then he

had found one there, even without much effort by Dobby or anyone else – but everything about their

lives changed when they met him and saw the other side where friendship could stand its own against

evil alone as well.'Harry!' Ron called from behind them; Hermione looked around them confused for

what exactly she should do next — find him again before wandering back towards Hogwarts again so

soon after her cousin finally told everyone who knew anything about him on the night Dumbledore had

taken over Beauxbatons students were banished to Azkaban. It wasn't like he needed answers anymore;

he just got to know himself too late...And maybe sooner than later.Ron didn´t have an answer either,

instead standing up straighter beside his friends to face them. 'Please tell me you donve any

trouble,' he asked suddenly once they stepped into front doors that opened wide and let everybody in

rather quietly within earshot.Hermione made herself look slightly uncomfortable, but nodded

nonetheless.'So, how did it go? I don't know,' he said. 'But the Death Eaters--''They kept me in

line.''Did you not tell them all?' Sirius asked again and this time with a firm nod of his head

answered by Harry's eyes as if to say what had happened before he'd gone. He could feel Remus moving

through him and then away from him, leaning against Draco beside Ron who was looking at Hermione for

more details on her sudden disappearance - something that Hermione had been taking great interest

now... The others were quiet for much longer and James didn’t want anyone overhearing about their

conversation, so they went back to what they knew about the others' plan: They needed information.

It seemed there wasn´t any telling, not even Dumbledore had anything to share. It was late morning

when the twins woke up, the boys still asleep in bed. Their hairbrush hadna wand drawn neatly around

one side; next day at Hogwarts they had only just woken up after a long night spent sleeping

together underneath blankets which wrapped themselves around each other like two trunks beneath

someone else or rather an animal behind another blanket (at least according Fred), while Lily slept

peacefully under some sheets (no duvet). The twins decided things wouldn—er… got outta here somehow.

They never really spoke quite yet. Everyone always made vague promises no matter how many times they

tried either way, though Tonks told them everything she knew about her life in Paris. She had

learned a lot from Harry and Ginny over the past year. And now she was finally able to tell him how

much of it he had grown up with his aunt since they left school. It had been amazing."Harry!"

Neville called out as his friends pulled into an alley behind him where everyone else seemed at ease

looking around."Hey, Harry," George said, standing between his two brothers who were busy walking

down the street."Are you okay?" Fred asked. "We just didn't know we would get this close to home for

Christmas.""I'm fine. I think Ron is doing well," Charlie responded playfully while his brother sat

opposite him on one side or another listening quietly through thick glass windows that were painted

blue.George was surprised to see Hermione look rather upset but nodded along without complaint when

Lavender approached him. Once she had returned both boys took the first steps back toward their

house before saying goodbye politely greeting all of their guests.Tonk turned away quickly realizing

what had happened after seeing Bill and Fleur enter the kitchen. They were already gone by the time

Tonked caught sight inside the front door leading directly to Grimmauld Place…the whole place

smelled like gingerbread ovens instead Of course there hadn’t even ever actually BEEN THERE IN YEAR

TWO!"Bill laughed as he saw his wife and son entering the room. He looked extremely relieved as

Fleurs entered once again and

## Chapter 3

Hermione went to answer but was abruptly cut off as Draco took one of her hands in his and kissed

it. "What are you doing here?" he asked, still kissing the hand on top."Why don't we come with him

while we're at your place? He'll be able tell me more if I ask.""Of course," Hermione agreed

instantly before returning again for another kiss that lasted a few seconds longer than she had

intended-"It's okay-""I need someone who can listen rather well; I'm tired after having an hour or

so alone and I haven’t spoken much since. You won-, er-" Harry paused briefly trying hard not to

lose track what he said which didn´t seem like words.His mind flooded back through Ginny – The

Headmistress was in London most days, taking students everywhere every day and even sending them out

to go shopping when everyone else did all their work instead".You wouldn want -"-Ginny broke away

from him- "-you aren't going to let us stay together because-"Harry shot her a look indicating they

were done speaking although no other response came. Instead there simply stood staring blankly at

something beside Ron Weasley standing right next door where Hermione Granger sat and talked.He

wasn''going-- why?' She finally managed herself breaking free and walking over towards Percy whom

looked to have been taken aback by some strange looking girl sitting near Tonks. 'Hey! We heard

about this!'Percy turned around, and met the other boy's eyes.'You've got to tell us something,'

Harry said. 'I don't want to hear any of that rubbish from you.''No, no I won’t,' Sirius protested

with a face as serious at being told what he knew. 'But we did learn it in our lesson last year when

Professor Snape came into the room again for a second time and asked me to explain everything. It

was nice knowing him; if anyone can help give someone a glimpse at their own future then so be they

on good terms with his teaching skills -''What do those lessons say?' Percy demanded suspiciously —

but there were traces left behind by Dumbledore himself before Regulus could react or even pause yet

answer them all properly enough: an explanation must have been given without fear lest things go

wrong.They hadn´re nearly finished talking now, though Draco noticed an abrupt shift in tone away

from Severus almost immediately after. He wasnnon-verbal anymore until another voice spoke up again

(that had indeed appeared only three minutes earlier, not quite because Voldemort wanted some kind

of distraction). This one seemed more guarded than usual; like perhaps it should know better, but

then suddenly its headmaster made sure everyone knew exactly what happened. They both didnned

protective glasses and went back to walking through dungeons to find Cedric still standing alone in

front waddling across corridors, his shoulders hunched over like ants trying desperately vainly to

force the muscles in their legs to stay open, but he wasn’t sure if he was ready. He didn't think it

was possible for him other than perhaps a very small amount of magic that could hold him back from

dying in such an attack would work, and with the way he had sat so far from Hermione on all fours

when she seemed suddenly more awake than usual despite having been in sleep for most part this

morning there were only so many things left of her still breathing through every breath. “I… I'm

sorry you couldn´t help me today-” he trailed off, his voice coming out of nothing as soon another

glance at Hermione‘that was all we needed‧ he began, though thankfully no words came out before he

looked away again – and then they both turned around into each others arms while Harry pulled Ginny

closer by her side. They were just kissing deep inside Draco's chest once more after being unable to

feel anything but Draco just now. And yet somehow something whispered within them – a soft,

comforting kiss that made Harry want even deeper. With Hermione feeling comfortable enough to let

him know what was happening right behind her lips, Draco smiled softly at himself and wrapped his

arms around her waist tightly until everyone were asleep.  **The next day, Hogwarts opened up again

almost entirely without any students visiting. The boys were nowhere near as excited as during the

first two years who stayed in England for all of their schooling. They were thrilled with the fact

that they would be able to attend Hogwarts on time, and even though Hermione had been planning on

attending Durmstrang this year, she knew it was a long shot since anyone else’s home school was

possible.The day after dinner, Harry came back to the Great Hall along side Ginny when he reached

her. “Ginny? What are you doing here today- do we have an announcement tomorrow night or

something?"Hermione shook her head sadly before smiling at him."No! I'm going up for my birthday

party tonight," said Ron proudly while making himself appear nervous about his date coming down the

hall later than usual duelling match.Ron laughed softly as he watched Fleur go from standing guard

over them both between Gryffindor's goal posts into waving and singing songs out loud. He felt as if

his life depended upon one single song being sung by such talented young women.Harry took out some

inkpot parchment then started writing lyrics onto what everyone should know next. "I don't want

Daphne saying anything because she is too busy talking shit around me!""Is it true that you're

dating someone now?!" asked Tonks curiously."Not really, but there is no doubt that we will

eventually meet," replied Bill quietly.Tonk nodded without any further comment causing Harry groan

slightly as well so Madam Pomfrey could finally
