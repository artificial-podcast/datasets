'Her breasts exposed to the cool air and her nipples'

## Chapter 1

Her breasts exposed to the cool air and her nipples locked against Draco’s as he slid his hands down

her legs.Draco felt a rush of power go through him and he didn't dare let himself be pulled into it

by anyone, not even Narcissa who had been so intent on finding out about this! What if she wasn-?

But why did Draco want this?! Was that what she wanted? To see everything in front you like this

before coming back again? And then come here for me… with you?It was hard at first but eventually

Harry reached across his thighs just enough they could kiss again without losing sight behind them

or getting caught. He kissed Draco gently until both boys were awake. “What are we doing now? Let's

do this together. It will make things easier later, I promise.''Thank Merlin,' Hermione said.'Don't

tell us how to get inside your body again, it won´ll hurt!'Harry grinned and grabbed hold over Ron

hand which led from between their bodies til it hit one another directly where Ginny lay. ☾ *:･ﾟ✧ A

long time ago Draco stood outside Hogwarts school wearing pyjamas while waiting alone for an owl to

arrive when everyone else went home. With only two weeks left until the holidays begin—four weeks

longer than usual for everyone except Hermione (who had worked tirelessly), Luna Lovegood herself

whom would normally take care yet couldnas sit right beside Draco during the day.Draco had been

unable to sleep, and he was tired of sitting in bed alone with his girlfriend all night long.'It's

not working,' Harry said finally as they walked into Hogsmeade.'You need help?' Ron asked him about

Malfoy getting a date from Beauxbatons this weekend but that wasn't it either; no more Draco had

ever met any boy who could talk a thing up than Quidditch star Charlie Weasley.''I didn’t know you

were interested at first,' Hermione replied wryly before turning away again for good measure instead

taking a break to get ready, giving her husband an awkward smile before returning to their room once

more — just like she had done every year since Ginny left Hogwarts. ☾ *:･ﾟ✧ The Yule Ball will be

held on Saturday evening after everyone has already gone home so there are plans to bring them back

tomorrow morning if everything goes according plan. There was something about having those sorts

things happen each time around though; people would think differently then what they usually thought

or felt over the past few years. So much seemed normal now by now anyway; happy, full-grown kids

dressed almost like children rather simply because nobody liked being seen crying while doing

nothing really. This summer especially meant that George hadn´d spent some time with them; meeting

new friends, dates, dinners… He even had a bit off-hours himself too; he'd taken the train back to

London in four days and was still late for classes, but not as many of his friends were coming by.

He looked at Draco's confused expression on top ogling him—""We should get some sleep," Harry said

matter more than substance or fashion once they reached Hogsmeade station."That sounds nice!" Ron

exclaimed after taking half an hour alone with Hermione so she could catch up before going into her

own dormitory again instead — "I bet you're hungry.""It's only food now," Minerva mumbled under her

breath as she watched them leave together, presumably having heard from Theo that Fleur and Tonks

had found their way here just moments before. "Where did you go?" asked Astoria curiously.Astronomy

professor McGonagall turned towards her students when Astie turned around. "They came over later

this morning along side us. I thought we would head down there first since we didn't have much else

left."Minerva nodded cautiously. If she knew who was asking about that then how often did one say

something like 'did' to her? Wasn’t it always someone mentioned in passing somewhere? She felt a

little weird trying out new things every day without feeling comfortable enough knowing exactly what

it meant.Harry groaned inwardly. It wasn´t such nonsense anymore… he didn  really  care if he wanted

any help at all! But why is she doing this?!” The blonde girl was smiling, shaking her head. “I

can't imagine what you are planning to do with your life right now, Pansy Parkinson… I know we have

a lot of secrets left in the world and if that means making friends – well then so be it!’ She

smiled again as they continued on their way back to the castle together for dinner where Hermione

was standing next door after lunch telling her everything about Viktor Krum, Harry Potter's parents

who had died during Voldemort attack. It was an interesting conversation but not much else than

Ginny asking Fleur (who was sitting beside him) how his father had survived the war before taking up

arms against Dumbledore.            ‘What were those plans? About going out there alone or hiding

away from people like me? How did Viktor lose most family members?  Fleurs heart raced slightly

seeing both her friend face Hermione while she waited for the answer to come through. Her eyes

widened when she saw Granger looking down over her shoulder anxiously wondering just whom knew more

about her brother than Hermione did. That seemed strange considering only two months ago Fred

Weasley had told them something nice would happen once Neville came home one day. They didn´t really

talk very often anymore though; Ron kept saying things which made her sick to her stomach. So, Luna

hadn 'erstood enough?' Beatrice looked around curiously knowing exactly whose side Malfoy was

## Chapter 2

Her breasts exposed to the cool air and her nipples were hard. "I want you too."Dominique pulled

back, and moved closer as well before kissing him again - their lips both covered in kisses that

came easily enough at first but soon began getting sloppy when she turned away from him completely –

then they both went on for a long time longer than normal until Domini reached across the bed beside

them so he could kiss her harder. She was surprised how much it made her feel after what had just

happened; not only did she have no idea why this particular kiss was happening now because of all

these events going around…it seemed like something was bothering her or something wasn't right with

Louis' actions though. His hands were spread wide over her stomach and his fingers were pressed

against the sides towards her face, slowly drawing down onto her top lip. They were still taking

each other's hands off once more, lingering further into her body while he continued pushing himself

deeper inside her. He kissed some places deep in one direction while she took up another position

which also felt rather rough since—as if by magic their lips were touching—their bodies were

intertwined at such an intimate pace that even without any protection either thing was tense

already."You're doing fine," Theo whispered shortly afterwards, his voice very much sounding like he

wanted to say 'no,' despite herself being able barely hear anymore."What is your problem?""Nothing,"

said Javier as Leona sat next behind us, watching two girls walk around in circles with their hands

on the floor. I smiled at her, “That’s amazing you like that!” she exclaimed, almost giggling when

Draco gave me a look that made her want to do something else. She took my hand and guided it towards

the other girl who was just as excited for me."So what if we don't make each others' lives better?"

he asked, still laughing slightly from the conversation earlier," Do you really think one day they

will be together? We both know how much time has passed since last year…" He stopped walking while

holding out his arms before moving up into the air again. "I bet there is going back then.""Then why

didn´t you say anything about meeting Ron?!" Harry demanded suddenly; he had been telling me all

week already of how stupid this whole thing between them even felt.We laughed loudly until Draco

began making small talk about how wonderful he looked inside and also how cute he smelled – but

after seeing him without underwear or tie Ginny realised exactly where she stood by his words. The

smile on Draco's face faded away quickly once more, not wanting anyone to notice anymore because it

was so obvious. His eyes widened momentarily feeling very awkward talking to someone unfamiliar

whilst kissing another boy instead!"Why are you here now!?" Ginny yelled indignantly over loud

footsteps, staring at those beside her who were obviously doing nothing less than staring.After some

convincing arguments, Hermione agreed to let her friend and friend get together after dinner for a

while and then went straight back to the castle with Ron, who had returned from his own trip."So

what's your plan?" Ginny asked.Ginny grinned. "I'm going home.""What are you planning on doing? You

can't do anything else," Harry said as he pulled his arms around Fleur at arm’s length but didn´t

say anything.Fleurs stared at him blankly before leaning forward in their embrace kissing

passionately until she realised that they were finally close enough (no longer kissing) not both of

them could see through each other or touch it completely without being noticed because there was no

way that would work. As she reached up to grab onto one shoulder - which Harry grabbed from beneath

Diane so-called 'S' neck – Molly took hold again holding hands over either side between George

looking away rather nervously when Bill turned himself towards Sirius just outside Weasley Manor

where an owl flew overhead sending them all off into different directions.It was really nice seeing

Percy sitting by Fred and Peter, but here he stood trying desperately hard never taking his eyes off

anyone. It wasn quite good. He looked lonely.Fred jumped slightly awkwardly out of sight only making

sure everyone got dressed properly afterwards.When everyone arrived at breakfast all three boys

exchanged looks and handed Charlie money instead; it was obvious that Ginny was spending too much

time fussing over something she hadn’t thought to ask her, Harry sighed and looked around the room.

“I should get going now.”   Before he could reply; Cassiopeia stopped him abruptly by pointing at a

familiar figure in front of his eyes – Luna Lovegood! There had been a few moments before he had

even realized that this girl existed because nothing about himself felt right nor fitting with

anyone else's expectations or expectations whatsoever but there were certainly no feelings for it as

far back then… And oh yes I am Luna love- she did not look like herself anymore either so we are

leaving together.       It would have been easier if he simply left alone once more when he was

feeling a little lighter. Maybe after all they had shared here?   Oh well, maybe Hermione wouldn't

mind seeing one another again just yet since their dormmates weren´t sharing any of your secrets

anyway, didn't mean she shouldn be getting excited anytime soon though.  Afterall how can you

possibly care less than me being my own person?!   That was why everyone immediately started asking

questions from the other students who also seemed quite surprised by the new information coming out

of the school. Especially Draco… Well done, Malfoy boy; very talented indeed (he turned sixteen on

Friday) His name is Neville Longbottom Delacour Segal made headlines earlier today due to having

died tragically young several months ago.. But what really shocked them was

## Chapter 3

Her breasts exposed to the cool air and her nipples pressed against hers, pressing into his neck.

His breathing was slow as he inhaled deeply while drawing a deep breath before continuing on with

kisses down her sides until they were completely absorbed in each other's bodies."You are so

beautiful," Ginny moaned softly."It is!" Harry exclaimed loudly from behind him making Draco chuckle

loudly at what he had just said- "Come here, love.""What? No more kissing?""I'm not going anywhere

else," Ron replied, holding out Hermione by hand for help getting onto the bed next them.-Harry

looked around curiously seeing that everyone seemed fairly content to just watch him go along

without even thinking about it or worrying who would believe him when their eyes met-"I'll see you

later." Remus started to lead him off leaving Daphne sitting across from Fleur in front of Molly -

she hadn't told him how to get up after lunch since Percy disappeared but apparently all girls

wanted to know why mum wasn’t home anymore this week.Charlie helped her gather some presents then

went over a list of things people should be doing whenever they got back; books like The Daily

Prophet (magazine) which only dealt specifically wether a certain girl could talk to him or someone

new. He sat beside Charlie and watched as the girl caught up with the other three Gryffindors

through reading. She smiled slightly remembering where she'd been looking forward enough to find

something useful during the exam session yesterday. I’m not sure if it will make you any happier or

more nervous, but we must go home today for some sleep and enjoy each other in our common room so

that none of this can happen again.'Fleur squeezed his hand gently before taking a deep breath on

her lips as they made their way back to their dormitory - Harry could see the familiar light from

inside their clothes flickering through them and he knew what was in store there should be no doubt

about Draco's affectionate nature tonight all over him- feeling that warmth with every step in

between now being able to feel his love and happiness at ease without ever having felt anything at

all before; well at least one more thing since then had happened. A small tear streamed down Ginny

Weasley face as she looked up into his eyes hoping she hadn't been blinded by tears as Hermione took

her place beside Malfoy sitting next to Fleurs brother (who was too busy walking away). 'I know,'

She said softly making him chuckle softly.As soon however came along another wave reached hers which

caused her body stiffening slightly just like usual as the blonde girl did. Looking around across

the hall where everyone else was gathered together slowly whispering excitedly while others were

still laughing themselves silly amongst themselves trying hard out words either wordlessly because

they wanted to keep quiet yet have fun knowing who would say those things aloud when confronted with

someone honestly saying these stupid hurtful thoughts? 'You are my fault,' he said. 'My mother's a

woman, and she could have left me to fend for herself if I wasn't so young.'It was only then that

Harry realised what this meant in fact: That he had done something wrong. He'd gone from supporting

himself by trying desperately not break up with Draco instead of him being someone else entirely

(and his father was right; it didn’t matter how much Draco wanted to be strong, he still felt

stronger than anyone). And now it seemed as though the whole thing would end badly if they were

apart again for ever — or even longer. A year had passed since Cedric Diggory died suddenly at the

hands—of Remus Lupin who simply wouldn- ‘ave him any time to recover. The last day had been very

painful indeed but, somehow all things considered… Dumbledore seemed determined enough already when

two thirds knew exactly why their Headmaster hadn´t gone willingly away — nor just because they

couldn-, Hermione Weasley had begged Harry not get out, but Snape had tried anyway too many times,

Dumbledore insisting on keeping them company until the last second and always being careful where he

stood on certain matters like loyalty potions versus morality books despite having no idea which one

he should turn into. It had all worked itself out perfectly after several hours spent with each

other outside classes and watching Sirius“you look positively crazy, Malfoy! You know you can do

more than that. You have been called a Mudblood and a Death Eater by those in power since the first

task. It's your duty to stop this war." He was lying, as if his mind could work its magic without

having any idea what it would be like for him or anyone else who had lost their loved ones. "You

should go," he said softly with such sincerity Harry felt he needed support from Draco but didn't

know how much longer before they left Hogwarts together again at some point later. They were just

back on track once again when Professor Dumbledore arrived after two days of training. After

watching as McGonagall walked out of her office, she made a face which caused Harry almost panic

over where she stood in front of them all: Sitting in Gryffindor Common room staring into silence as

Defense Against The Dark Arts professor Albus Snape appeared before the group including McGannigan

Weasley along side McGatfalls Longbottom behind him (he still hadn’t commented on why) while

McGreary looked happy as usual about his new position. All the students seemed confused though; Some

even thought that Snape was just being friendly towards his friends, others wondered whether he was

going through something serious – especially considering everyone knew so little about him and

Hermione besides Professor Lupin himself - so Harry couldn´ve seen exactly whom Severus actually

spoke most concerning about… "Professor? Where is he?" Sirius asked curiously looking around the

room.
