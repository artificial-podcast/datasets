'This was why she was somewhat jealous of Fleur, whose boobs were'

## Chapter 1

This was why she was somewhat jealous of Fleur, whose boobs were even bigger than those they’d seen

in a few months. They‘re beautiful! I didn't know you could look this good on me…I just thought it

was weird that one dress made my hair look so big and blonde. And then again because your style is

such an expensive thing to put up with."As the others watched Remus take his place next – Ginny

watching from opposite ends as Hermione – Tonks took her time to gather herself together in front

not wanting anyone else overhearing them speaking to her about how much younger everyone looked at

the sight before him compared against their usual selves - "What do we have here?"Remus nodded

approvingly while Harry continued," Our room will be used for our wedding reception.""Who are these

two?"Ginny shook her head slowly pulling back into the chair beside Remusing where they both sat

listening intently while she listened silently trying desperately get through what she had just

heard.Harry's eyes fell on another person sitting across from him who was looking very tired but did

indeed have something to say. He immediately glanced over to Ginny; he caught the girl's gaze and

smiled down at once. His cheeks flushed slightly seeing the look exchanged between each other's

faces. "Did Fleurs ask if you wanted us there too? What would happen if we tried anything?"Bill said

softly," Well, most girls think they can charm us without any problems. But the problem is that he's

not strong enough.""Yes, but I know how to cast it on him," She said with a nod and nodded. "What if

something happens?""You could be in an animal or plant for a while, then," He explained as she threw

his arm around her waist."I'll try my best!" Fleur exclaimed before jumping up and running into

Remus.Remused, Sirius grinned at them both before heading out of the room. His friends did have a

laugh when they spotted Bill again after lunch; Fred was still looking over all of their dates'

plans, though most had decided against going back to Hogwarts so they weren't planning on returning

anytime soon…but even there, Ron didn’t look too surprised anymore."Wow, what are you doing today?

You've been thinking about some things lately," Harry asked."That makes sense," Charlie told Albus

quickly."He sent me this last time we were here because...he really wanted dinner tonight," Remulus

responded before George pulled Tonks away from him making everyone else turn red. Bill turned

towards Ginny and smiled slightly.As far as Hermione knew just hours ago only one other woman –

Angelina Lockwood - would be joining the Weasley's now. The three girls looked at each others asking

questions which made Molly chuckle softly.It wasn´t until several minutes later that people started

showing interest in talking to her. By the end everything had gone quiet and she was thanking Jack

for his help, but it didn't matter as he still sat on one of those small benches that Dominique

could sit beside him just behind two other students who were all looking at her with a curious sort

expression."Hey," I said when they finally finished their conversation before heading back up toward

where Quidditch practice might be taking place.""Yeah, alright," Louis said softly. "We'll see you

later tonight?" He waved hello after them both turned around so no one else would have an

opportunity like this because there was only about ten minutes left until dinner time. When everyone

started getting ready though—which meant not having another walk or run away from each other since

almost eight hours ago—they continued down into the Great Hall while Professor Sprout stood between

James' and me. She'd reached out to grab my arm off the bench by pulling some of the loose clothes

onto it rather than leaning against it; apparently none seemed to work properly yet neither did

anyone seem comfortable with holding hands either.'Oh! Didn’t hear anything,' Remus muttered under

his breath as we settled ourselves comfortably next our respective desks. 'I don´d know if I should

say that again.''You can call your own name now then,' Sirius murmured without even trying anymore

effort once more considering how much longer things took us to talk over what happened during lunch

break today. “We really need to go find Professor Sprout,” she said with a sigh and looked back at

the clock on her desk as if it were useless now that they were out of earshot or something in

between both their conversations; she had no idea what time he was currently so she just shrugged

off her own thoughts for now while still wanting some peace before going into another meeting up

right after tomorrow's exams are due…             A week away from seeing his wife again meant all

those weeks gone by without him even realizing how much better Hermione would be than when Daphne

told him about having a baby girl years ago. He hadn't been expecting any response yet but whenever

things went wrong Harry could always count on himself for helping him through it by giving him

pointers along these lines: When to approach first Dumbledore came over saying nothing until dinner

(Dumbledore hasn´t made many promises lately) How often to ask questions afterwards where there is

an answer Potions Master will talk most of the time First-years needed more knowledge Second year

needing new methods Third year coming around Fourth year being introduced to potion techniques 5th

Year knowing which potions ingredients exist Sixth year brewing NEWTS? 8 – 9 hours Riddle sat alone

like this throughout class making sure everything else stayed put 15 minutes later Snape stood

leaning against the wall reading aloud writing notes down words one by word once every few days

Severus Snape left behind taking care not disturb anyone outside The Dark Lord didnnonnt show

concern

## Chapter 2

This was why she was somewhat jealous of Fleur, whose boobs were so big that she could barely fit

through a pair. She had been looking forward to getting back at her girlfriend the next day, but

now, it seemed as if things had gone south between them."Are you sure this is okay?" asked Teddie

after dinner," I mean...I know we are on holiday.""You'll have to see Hermione tomorrow for your

NEWTs and Transfiguration exam - how did he do in those?" Ginny asked," He has gotten really good

with potions today! It's nice!""He's great and he's got all kinds of work to do while we're here,"

said Blaise before they left for London together – once everyone else had finished their lunch. He

glanced over his shoulder again when Harry entered the Great Hall and saw Professor McGonagall sat

down beside him."How much longer will you be out of school?" Dumbledore demanded from behind Harry

during breakfast last week; she had taken some time off just to make room for him until early

November. "What about the other three? You didn't say anything yesterday either, or should I take

care of something important right away?"Harry sighed loudly. The headmaster continued: "-Yes, Miss

Greengrass replied what Madame Pomfrey told me…I shall explain more later tonight—and then Minerva

may ask Mr Potter where you go going into further trouble…"The headmistress gestured to an empty

classroom near which Remus was stood, his head held high.“I heard about your aunt and uncle being

married in France just before the war? They were both of us… it took a while, but I believe that you

have all been together for over twenty years now so they would be proud as well if we are still here

today! Thank goodness their parents never died, how could they not be?! Is that possible?! It’s

true, my mother is still alive and living there, she” said sharply ‘she had no choice in marrying

James Potter, her family did because they were forced into it by Dumbledore and then by Voldemort‽

He turned away from her again. ‥and gave birth right after he left me, our families remain intact,

though some families even try out for positions at Hogwarts like this one. We will be here when

people want them, always welcome, or let someone else go first year with their dreams faded behind

closed doors, maybe later than usual once everyone is home alone. That is why Mary-Anne lived long

enough last year without anyone hearing what happened to her, yet somehow came back two years ago.

So thankful Lily was able talk to these three witches who taught only half the schoolwork during her

time on Earth, despite having more work under their belts trying every single spell imaginable. She

knows nothing about Muggles nor wizards, neither does she know anything about witches otherials,

witchkind (or just anybody that you can name) or wizards. You’re not an expert in them either."

Harry let out a weak laugh as he turned to the rest of his group," They are pretty good at Quidditch

- they also know how much magic we can cast without even knowing the spells.""So, why don't you go

shopping?" Teddie asked Hermione Granger as she came through the door and made her way over," I want

to make sure Fleur gets some more dresses for us both so we could have our own shop next week after

classes start."Hermione nodded quickly before walking up with Theo and Adrian.Teddy was smiling

slightly while Marcus grinned seeing him happily helping everyone get ready together whilst Ginny

helped herself with tea. "I like spending time alone here during the summer but it is nice when

someone else does it too," said Draco Malfoy teasingly," It's really fun!""It is all my fault

though! If anyone cares what your parents think, their opinions on me will be irrelevant once

again," replied Harry mockingly," As long as there isn´t one person who thinks something bad towards

me personally and because I haven a-really-" He gestured towards the portrait hole where he had

started taking pictures of people enjoying themselves while Draco took off his shirt and put it back

on," Now that Potter has finally arrived...we need these new dresses since nothing happened last

night. Plus Dobby wants to know what you think of the new book," she said, "and I want him not only

his opinion but yours too."Hermione rolled her eyes and sat down on one side while Ginny turned back

to Hermione for a long moment before pulling up a chair in front with an arm around Harry's waist so

he could sit down next them both as well - they sat together again after that just sitting like this

for another few minutes until they settled into their new lives. Ron had been looking over at her

when they left Hogwarts almost immediately, even though he hadn't seen or spoken to her about it

lately. He'd gotten nervous from reading everything written by Draco and Harry, so the thought was

good; he knew there were some things he couldn’t control. “I don´ve anything to worry About either

way – we have two classes tomorrow morning-” Hermione began blushing.Ginny looked away slightly

before continuing:  "Why is everyone still whispering about me?"Ron chuckled as he stared out across

Remus' garden outside London which caused Hermione goosebumps every time he spoke to us. She laughed

softly and took a seat beside Bill who snorted loudly.""They all went off to France today because

they wanted something to talk about instead!" George started.Remius nodded. When he heard how

quickly they were getting ready later than usual, he ran straight to take Ginny along with Oliver

Wood who came running

## Chapter 3

This was why she was somewhat jealous of Fleur, whose boobs were just as large and fluffy. She'd

been trying to convince her that they should stay together for a while longer – even if it meant

losing their friendship."Fleur!" "Why?" Dominique asked. "So you can have an open mind when it comes

up in the tournament? Why not stop being such dickheads all year long?""Because I love watching

girls' bodies grow," said Louis slowly now gesturing toward the boys who were looking on with

interest at his girlfriend's breasts (which had grown nearly ten inches). "And my friends aren't

going anywhere near this."Dominic could hear him say nothing because he continued walking forward

before stopping abruptly. They both looked around quickly but then froze—one stopped right after

another. The Beauxbatons students didn’t appear to be having any problems with girls“I know! What

are you doing?!" one of the Ravenclaws shouted back. He turned away from them once again and made to

follow Jack behind more closely. “How dare you… You look so cute over here!”The three teens suddenly

took off down the hall without hesitation and landed upon something else. It was a dark tunnel

leading to two separate rooms; one facing the castle entrance and containing a set table by several

Gryffindors; there wasn´Teddy sitting alone next only slightly taller than Victoire standing nearby.

His posture felt very like someone would pick him up and run away, but he knew it was the right

decision."I can't believe you didn’t tell me what to do," said Daphne as she returned to her seat

beside Teddie with a worried look on her face from across his shoulder that looked vaguely

familiar.""Come back here then," Blaise barked out before following after them."Alright," Theo said,

returning to his spot next against Mason's. "Let‘s go find your friends first thing in the morning

so we don´t have too many questions for you."Tears welled up inside of Marcus' eyes when he heard

Derrick‽s name. He turned around quickly, stopping just short at Harry who caught sight behind where

Adrian had stood leaning over one another and looking around curiously. Teary tears streamed down

Louis', but they were thankfully gone by the time McGonagall arrived leaving Alastor alone without

any sign whatsoever between them other than the ones Cassiopeia received this morning.Bloised

shifted slightly while everyone else waited until Professor Flitwick spoke again; though not wanting

to see why Amalie had taken such an interest into their relationship even if she did feel something

was wrong. She'd known since school days about Malfoy's past - now she almost certainly wouldn

“maze” anyone close enough or genuinely approach Draco outside class every day. It meant nothing to

most people – it just means they would have the best time, and could spend as much time together as

possible. The worst part was that Sirius didn’t care about those things at all. He wanted her to be

happy, he knew she had done well in school before. She‘d probably make a great teacher if anyone

else ever asked her what she wanted with their future careers or where they might land next year

even though she really couldn't tell. Sirius tried not paying attention either when a girl

approached him asking for his opinion on who he thought were the greatest teachers of all- but there

wasn´t any way around this feeling anymore because Harry just kept staring at him… The girls weren?

They looked like small children. Not one single person seemed interested enough within themselves

(the few that did made sure no girl took offense). When Harry stopped staring, Hermione gave an

annoyed look towards them all."You are so young, Harry Potter," Daphne said quietly while she

watched several other girls. "I don  think you know how beautiful you can get from being around

these older boys. You should do your own research into how many different men dress up each month

based off their looks.""It depends," Remus replied softly.Hermione nodded. “We need more evidence

than we already have. We still haven            figured out exactly why some girls only go by

Gryffindors; others believe that Slytherins actually belong in Gryffindor.” “I think he meant to ask

me if I was aware of the boy being called Malfoy? He wasn't one for prejudice,’ Harry mused aloud as

they passed through a small corridor. ‘He certainly didn´t mean what you see here- but it would have

been nice…‪ ‽Because Potter is a wizard. You can understand why people treat him differently than

their peers. Perhaps Draco will learn to appreciate his privileges by now and come out into our

world after all! Maybe then we might even be able somehow break down barriers between us two? That

could be very useful next year so long – remember how many students were expelled last term?! It

wouldn've happened without a reason or with malice on your part ;) This school isn-,  -- no more

talking about it when you're alone anymore! We donned robes again this morning, not realizing yet

that Dumbledore had already spoken with them before entering. One final note from Potter: If you are

going anywhere, please make sure nobody else sees you! Your brother is an idiot sometimes though..  

Dear Mr Delacour Dippet : My dear friends... Daphne took notes during lunchtime today and sent her

owl back asking permission (to keep track). The reply she got only said yes because she thought

Professor Snape had talked to him yesterday evening and therefore told her everything needed

explained. As well
