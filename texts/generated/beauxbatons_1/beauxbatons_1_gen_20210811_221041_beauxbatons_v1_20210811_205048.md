## Chapter 1

“No!” she shrieked in realisation, and her eyes snapped shut. ‘You can do this if you want! I won't

let a witch make another mistake like that! You are my champion now – even if it means losing to a

Muggle! Why wouldn´t you try?’ The Slytherin girl turned around so quickly that Ava didn not notice

how she was smiling down at them all as they walked away.            When the ball came back into

play again on Wednesday morning, Beatrice had yet more information about where everyone would be

heading for after dinner today: She hadn just received word from Gwin that Javier Longoria – who

played with Teddie and Blanche during their year-long Quidditch training sessions – was coming over

later tonight (which meant he wasn—however unhelpfully) to coach Durmstrang students towards the

finals of the Triwizard Tournament tomorrow evening; though no one else seemed very keen either

because neither Madame Pomfrey nor any other staff were present. It made sense given what McGonagall

said but…   Then there is Hestia Greengrass joining Lilith yesterday afternoon outside Hogwarts

School when Cedric Diggory will take up residence inside Beauxbatons Academy just before lunchtime.

Professor Sinistra told reporters shortly afterwards that both Camille Tonks' parents attended

Hogwarts along side Magical Law Enforcement Captain Ronald Weasley and Defence Against the Dark Arts

professor Minerva MacFarlan, who was working on a thesis about how magic works. McGonagall had asked

her to meet with Harry at his home in London last night, but he had refused so she said she would

let him take over as Professor. He hadn't been able find it in himself that one of their professors

wanted more time than normal after all these years."Professor Dumbledore has a bit," said Hermione

quietly; "he wants us back for another week or two.""Yes?" Ron said matter-of-,factly again from

behind them before they could properly discuss what was going through Mr Weasley's head right now —

trying not think hard enough. A smile spread across both Malfoy’s face then passed between Neville

Longbottom by quickly stepping out of view. Hermione sighed softly, sitting up straight and hugging

Ginny tightly.Ron opened an apologetic glance towards the other table where everyone had been

gathered before turning away to go look at something else—something far worse still involving

someone else besides Draco Granger being near death upon herself…Something black seemed coming from

somewhere in front half way between Lavender Browning whom stood silently watching Hermione stand

there as if afraid this very thing was happening without even bothering asking any questions about

why it happened nor whether she should ever have been invited into Hogwarts instead because of

anything. And yet somehow it had managed such astonishing speed and beauty.Hermione smiled once more

when Viktor Krum sat next to Fleur Delacour who had an identical scar on her shoulder. “It’s a bit

different, is it?” she asked.  Fleurs nodded. They were still talking.   A few minutes later Madame

Maxime arrived and they all made their way back up the stairs into class, and Hermione noticed that

Philippe was waiting for them at one of his tables when he came around: He looked as though Harry

Potter hadn't yet gone home to Hogwarts but rather be staying with Ginny Weasley, so he approached

them both quickly without much difficulty which caused him laughter – everyone laughed at this scene

in front straight away!       The lesson ended almost immediately afterwards; Dumbledore, Mulciber

finally finding out what had happened, gave Charlie some extra credit by saying 'it has been sorted'

because the students didn´t have time enough not knowing how those lessons would play out. So Harry

got two more points from Gryffindor instead (he really liked McGonagall) whilst Andromeda managed

just three points while Professor Binnz kept score despite being late to work.'What did you say

about me?'Harry wasn            surprised but also relieved, especially after hearing Lupin explain

himself perfectly and clearly why it was important to get ready again today since everything could

happen tomorrow… and then Remus wouldnât let any doubt settle behind the headsmaster's words.Harry

felt like there must've never once crossed between happiness before now or anything else. “But

Harry,” he said softly to her as she lay back on the floor and rested a hand on his shoulder for

support in bed beside him with an open book still resting against one of them while they sat reading

together.   He looked up at Ginny, his eyes narrowing slightly when she stood there with her hands

clasped behind her head waiting patiently until he was done speaking again that night about their

relationship which was going well enough. But then it occurred not only so that he could talk about

Harry but also about what had happened since those fateful nights; the two boys who were both more

than happy parents, but happier people too — just like everyone already knew. It had taken several

hours for Hermione's emotions have come to light, so much so… he couldn't quite make his words fit

into sentences anymore even though they weren´t trying hard— but luckily the girl wasnnon-verbal and

understood things far better from any other person he knew that liked girls.She smiled slowly over

at Draco, the soft laugh that had filled her voice making her cheeks flush red as well leaving her

expression blankly staring down at the table next door. She felt very close to this boy all along

because whenever they talked about each other, he always seemed to be the one who made her feel

special. Draco bit the inside smooth side off of hers, wanting nothing less than love for her cousin

forever. The girl nodded after touching herself

## Chapter 2

“No!” she shrieked in realisation, and James couldn't help but throw his arms around her. “Come on,

let's go… We can just stay here forever?!’ And he was right, of course! But then the sound went off

again, though it was only a few feet away. Draco grabbed for Remus by sheer force; he had never seen

anything so violent before that could do such an injustice to him — now he didn´t know what would

happen if they did! He reached out, pulled Rem into close-cropped kisses as well with one hand

holding both their mouths. They took each other like brothers and kissed passionately, lips ever so

tightly together as when their breath hitched at something too intimate. The sight made Draco feel

even more secure. There were times when Sirius wouldn—didnn him — stand there with his chest pressed

against hers while Draco tried not to look at them at all despite how much pressure it caused upon

himself inside or around those who touched him physically (which was very rare). In fact every time

Lily gave up her own virginity or offered another one, Harry knew exactly where his heart must be if

this weren? How long would Severus have been able to keep his virginity after taking it from people

without their consent? And why wasn  suddenly so certain that everyone would believe that things

between these two boys hadn            happened because some part is going bad yet others don' think

it will happen,' she added. 'That means you are in the same situation as me.'Draco glanced at her in

confusion, he didn't know what to say. What could be so different about Draco's words? And why was

she not surprised by them?'You won't do anything wrong again,' Harry said firmly and with a slight

smile; his voice softer than usual but still firm enough for everyone else either side of him now

knew that this would never end well between their friends anymore — and even though they'd already

lost one another on both sides (which had been inevitable), there wasn’t much point in worrying any

more while they were all alone together for just today.''No, I don´t care how good you look!' Ron

shouted, pulling his robes off his shoulders as if trying hard! But then he fell into step with

Hermione beside Malfoy who did nothing more than shrug herself out from under McGonagall slightly

before coming back towards Harry with an equally confused expression which seemed too soft at first

glance only because everybody here saw Harry Potter move away slowly like some kinda madman turning

ice cream into powder instead... He turned around quickly without warning and gave up looking down

at where the other two girls sat next behind. Even Blotts who weren-whoops sounded disappointed when

he left himself a single laugh despite having no idea whether he should have thought that sooner or

later. They took each person sitting opposite him awkwardly except Daphne who was attempting to

imitate his posture. “Hey!” he exclaimed. Harry had an advantage over the other students when it

came down to talking, because all of them were going on about their experiences with Slytherin

Quidditch and how he knew that none would dare try anything different or even criticize him for the

wrong reasons as well but they couldn't be bothered to listen. When Teddie noticed her friend

standing next to her, she glanced at Parkinson in surprise. Her eyes looked like a little girl,

though not necessarily very young either – something Draco assumed Malfoy could have picked up from

watching Theo play catch. She blinked slightly before continuing her sentence once more, "So you've

gotten onto your broom?"Draco gave her a curious look. "I thought I'd see what my friends

liked."Tears welled up in her eyes as she shook her head. A small smile spread across her face which

made Blaise scoff, still smiling. He didn´t know why; if someone really cared enough towards him

then maybe there was no point in having another argument against him…But eventually, after seeing

Mason, Marcus' eyes snapped open and he suddenly stood straight, turning away so that only Amelie

remained. His brown hair turned into pale blue-grey instead making the whole room look at Albus

Dumbledore rather suspiciously while others continued looking confused.Before anyone got too

excited, Trelawney grabbed hold of his arm and threw him to the ground. "Theo!" She screamed, her

voice muffled by Malfoy's broken hand."You're dead," Parkinson said loudly as he lay on top Harry

with a bloody nose in front both arms from what appeared like an over-thetop attack that caused

everyone else just moments ago even more hurt than usual due their injuries. He was covered

completely up with blood pouring down his face and body; it was hard not be grateful for the

treatment given by Professor Dumbledore himself.Teddie looked at Mason who nodded after confirming

something she'd never heard before about Teddy Lupin being a Death Eater."So do you think we should

go back inside?" asked Tilly quietly," We need cover now.""We'll wait there until this is all

cleared out," said Daphne.Malfoy rolled around still sobbing but smiling when Tyla backed away

without another word or sound as they descended the stairs towards the Entrance Hall where the

students had been waiting while Draco continued through class. The doors closed behind them again

under Snape making McGonagall turn angrily into Theo. Once outside, Minerva began her explanation

explaining how the time travel spell worked so that one could transfigure themselves instantly

(something which would take longer if it wasn't already known) instead leaving no doubt whatsoever

that someone wanted to know why Voldemort had made the decision. As far ahead as Madame Maxime was,

however - a

## Chapter 3

“No!” she shrieked in realisation, and then a spell was cast upon her.She felt the cold thud of

another Spell being cast on them once more as they took their positions. Harry let out an impatient

sigh, his face reddening. “What are you doing here? You have no idea how to deal with this…this is

just...it's so dangerous for me now that I can't even think about anything else after everything

that has happened. So why don-, what do we do instead or go back to Hogwarts? What if something

happens?’ He tried again but Draco could hear him crying out in pain – it made him feel sick too; he

had been scared himself too many times by things like these since before coming here.Harry rolled

onto one knee at Hermione who was sitting next to Daphne whose hand came up over hers when Teddie

pulled away from Blaise mid-sentence: 'Merlin,' said Andromeda gently enough not exactly whispering

but biting into her bottom lip to keep the tears streaming down her cheeks.'I'll take care off it

tomorrow morning, Professor Snape,' Malfoy responded through gritted teeth which suddenly tasted

bitter and intoxicating while also making Tagg blush slightly inside herself'Oui!' Scrimgeour

ordered, causing a large pile piled high around him where Dumbledore stood. There were several small

portraits set up nearby all full time waiting patiently awaiting any possible answers to questions

posed by Dumbledore.He had a few more minutes before he set out his list of items, all labelled with

the year in which they were purchased. It was as if an old school diary had been slipped into

Harry's hand, and they wondered where it might go. Draco smiled as Fleur pulled out her own copy

from within their box."I'm not sure I know how this works," Hermione said blankly when she saw that

Draco wasn't looking at them together so much anymore - "but you did tell me about Muggle

Studies.""Oh?""Yes! My first cousin who lived in France taught me some," Ron replied quietly after

getting up to get dressed for breakfast on Friday morning alone without anyone else to watch him

work away hours later than usual duelling Ginny over something which made her laugh loudly but also

annoyed herself enough otherwise what happened next would be far beyond anything she'd ever

experienced. She didn’t really have time since Saturday evening (after having finished eating),

feeling rather lost and confused."So what is this?" Theo asked as he stood outside of Diagon Alley.

He noticed that everyone had stopped talking or sitting near a group waiting for the train to take

off; those around Weasley could see people bustling along the corridor until someone even came

calling attention."The Triwizard Tournament!" The twins laughed uproariously while Hermione pouted

slightly because she knew exactly why these people weren´t here."It has nothing whatsoever going

against Hogwarts," Teddie said. "No, it's just another reason why I was worried about your

mother.""She doesn't even know what a Death Eater is," Daphne said with amusement as the others

shared similar reactions to her comment and continued their conversation until Professor Snape

stopped them. He had been talking about the Black Plague in the library when he suddenly began

speaking again before adding that there were many ways of dealing this problem than through magic

alone; from writing curses on people or enchanting items like wards around dormitories for

instance.-"You've heard all about Dark Arts?" Sirius asked quietly after Madam Pomfrey arrived at

the scene- he made a face."I'm not sure if you're aware Harry Potter also happens to be an Auror…but

who are those? We might have better luck finding out later today because my father has already told

me most likely they are Headmasters.""We don’T know anything beyond what our sources say, but…"

McGonagall interrupted him, looking over at Harry curiously"-Professor Dumbledore seems rather

pleased with himself," she added sarcastically - causing his eyes widen slightly.Harry nodded

silently while holding up two hands. They both laughed, though Draco looked a little confused by how

much the room seemed different. It was only then that Theo got called to his common rooms which

allowed him some privacy and he instead turned back to see Remus and Tonks standing beside one other

girl, who’s in her twenties. “Hey!” she says to Harry with a smile of annoyance on his face as he

looks over at the two taller witches next behind him (in fact they were both twenty-two years

old).‘I think I may be missing something,' Ron remarks quietly for Hermione when Professor

McGonagall gives them all some kind approval before pulling out an enchanted bracelet from the

pocket there.'How did you know?' Fleur asks, still looking uncomfortable by now.''You weren't very

good at Quidditch back then; Harry. You never had any real experience whatsoever because it wasn´t

fair that you couldn  try anything new or different than what you knew. So… well?''No magic ever

really crossed my mind as much anymore — that was until maybe fifteen minutes ago,' Draco tells

Ginny immediately after their arrival into Hogwarts just past the first desks where Hagrid is

standing, and although Ginny thinks this isn 'too great', she's not wrong about why Hagrids are

dangerous sometimes but how lucky we actually get to see our heroes again. And yet despite the

obvious similarities, they can always feel like little more...together.' Harry gets up fast enough,

so Draco follows him in stride, eyes fixed firmly onto Bill whilst Cedric stumbles slightly off

balance. He hears something knocking against another desk under Dumbledore himself – whispers,

perhaps - before Lupo comes running through the door
