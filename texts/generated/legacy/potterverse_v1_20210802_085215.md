'Her thighs began to quiver as she continued to fuck into the'

## Chapter 1

Her thighs began to quiver as she continued to fuck into the tight confines of his trousers. “Fuck!
Fuck,” he groaned against her lips and then bucked back in. She let out a low moan that sounded like
it was coming from somewhere inside him—possibly between them now… Draco reached down with one hand
before lifting his head and watching their sex warily while they worked together on each other's
arms so desperately- Hermione whined slightly and looked up at Ron for help taking control over
herself. The grey eyes were hardening, but she could see them still observing her attentions. Their
joined hands rested there together again briefly holding onto an inch or two of skin pressing
against it as if trying not go any further. Hermione slowly pushed forward until both fingers found
themselves pressed tightly together. Her hips twitched rhythmically once more bringing closer and
nearer so just enough pressure could be felt to give them enough time even though she knew it wasn't
happening. A small shuddered noise made its way to Bellatrix who shook violently when she realized
what it meant; Ron had been fucking her off after all. And Harry was too far gone already thinking
about what the fuck this was about anymore. "Do you want me," she whispered under voice crackingly;
knowing she would have to think about it later. But here came right where no man had left her
without warning. Not only had he fucked her senseless yet again, Bellatsy seemed intent upon
continuing to do whatever she could to help Hermione. “I’m not going anywhere if you don't follow
through,” Bellatrix said with a small smile as Hermione looked at her sharply and gave a light
shrug. Hermione saw the smile change into an angry look and then Bellows began laughing. They had
come this far from Hogwarts but there was still time to get back in the Chamber before they went
back up. She would be gone for another year now, maybe even longer. As Bells laughed harder than
ever Bella rose slowly and moved towards them, one hand on top of their head, pulling away when the
other reached down to grab both shoulders, causing Bellto turn his face backwards so that he was
staring down at Hermione while making sure it didnned the best shape possible. It wasnt long though
before Hermione felt herself becoming more nervous around Bellbe's face as well because she knew how
much attention each witch got…and what kind did they get? And suddenly Hermione found herself being
very attracted by Bellany Granger; the one who was always looking after her just like that whenever
they were alone. The only thing different between the two women at the moment was the fact where she
was standing right next to Narcissa Malfoy in front Harry Potter; and no matter how many times Ron
had been told that something was wrong within him or tried unsuccessfully enough, either one kept
coming across as friendly or dangerous. Every time Draco had let her out of his sight, she'd say
something like “Yeah, I guess I’m safe with you in the house. But now you don't have to worry about
me being here any longer. You know how much we love each other and there's nothing I can do that
will make us both happy.” Her expression went a little smug. Severus didn—couldn? He knew Hermione
was not against sharing things between them; he just wasnt used enough for it yet. She nodded slowly
again at him once they were alone together: "Are these some kind reference?" Oh, yes! There would be
no need – if this all worked out between their minds… Yes indeed Harry could relax when his mother
was gone for good. After giving Snape another wiggle before continuing on towards dinner (which
ended up happening more than once), Ginny followed suit, opening one plate after two while Lucius
sat down behind Potter sitting next to Crabbe looking annoyed and frustrated. They both ate quickly,
finishing their dinner by getting into bed and then making up. Hermione had left most meals
unattended so far without Malfoy noticing — but she did sneak glances at Luna and Seamus who got
suspiciously close during breakfast. The only thing keeping Ron from leaving them out was because
Weasley looked decidedly uncomfortable with what happened outside right away. As Hermione began
writing notes on parchment over an old curse book instead laid down to write herself off until
lunchtime tomorrow, and then she’d be back to it. She was still sad when he got home from work the
next day with a letter from his godson pleading for her hand so that they could spend some time
together at Malfoy Manor instead of in bed or studying alone together on their own schedule (he had
called him Draco since before Hermione came along), but it was nice having someone who knew what was
coming up; maybe even something to eat sometime soon? If not after dinner, it would just feel
strange while being so busy and busy with homework. He didn't know how long it might take her again
though… Notes: This story is part-written by TBC, which means I don'st OWN anything! AN1: Thank you

travel.) Chapter Text Tuesday morning, Harry returned to school early—on his way out anyway because
Ron thought he was late. “I have to go see McGonagall today,” Dumbledore said, sounding anxious.
Harry turned around, walking towards them. They were both shocked at the sudden change between
himself where he stood and his new position. Then Ron noticed Harry‘s arm twitch slightly against
him. Ron swallowed and looked away as if trying hard enough. “What do you mean?” The blonde tipped
his head back, eyes gleaming in the moonlight. Harry sighed deeply but nodded slowly before turning
to face Hermione once more on a cold stone path towards their bedchambers again with eager
determination running through him like an adrenaline-spiked high at her back.  ...and then she
turned around nearly losing herself in fear as she felt a hand on her shoulder push up onto hers
firmly pulling her close. She let out a shocked breath of relief when the other woman leaned into
them and stroked her cheek gently while rubbing her heart. Then another hand moved from between
theirs for a moment before drawing it across Hermione's hair and brushing it lightly against each
side until they were hugging so tightly that her cheeks flushed and there was almost nothing left
where he could see her. He pressed himself closer to her stillness keeping his gaze locked upon Luna
as the older witch started forward moving forwards holding the door open behind them. Hermione held
her breath waiting for the blonde girl who didn't give a shit about what happened next to find her
trapped inside and couldn just ignore it. Once they had been separated they both walked over quickly
turning their attention to one last thing before heading down the hall. They followed silently
outside the bedroom along which Draco found several small books and some spare change strewn about.
When they entered this room alone Hermione took a deep breath letting go carefully looking around
searching for anything. She didn't even have a chance to move her head when he yanked at the chain
that had fallen off her arm causing it falling backwards on its own and she toppled over, nearly
crumpling onto herself. He pulled himself from where she was still breathing heavily picking up the
pieces of clothing in his hands grabbing them both before helping himself back out of sight as he
looked down towards Draco who raised a brow leaning against Hermione who wasn’t paying attention to
him. “What is wrong?” Ron asked pulling an item away from her pocket putting it into one hand
holding it together. Harry moved closer to Draco bringing his mouth close enough so they both could
taste each other. "You smell like food." Draco said folding his arms across his chest laying his
forehead on hers making sure nothing else would disturb them. As soon Voldemort's voice sounded
behind them finding their eyes not seeing what came next or just hearing someone say something
disgusting left all three with a look of confusion. Hermione let out a small gasp clutching her
stomach trying desperately pushing past the pain in her legs feeling everything hitting it hard.
Then he grinned moving slightly more pressing kisses along neck and cheek kissing lightly brushing
teeth running through his hair digging his nails deeper inside of her skin opening her lips slowly
sucking on them until finally taking full advantage then turning forward standing there staring at
Voldemort waiting for him once again turning completely pale while his entire body shook beneath his
kiss. When Voldemort turned around, she felt him wrap an arm around her waist and squeeze her hand
tighter as he kissed down the back of it in return for a kiss to both their lips on each other's
skin again one more time before turning back around to look at Draco who was smirking wickedly
behind them. "You're not going anywhere," Lucius drawled, watching Hermione and Ron exchange looks
of bewilderment. They were starting toward dinner when they heard Harry's voice saying something
from behind Hermione that caused both witches panic over what to say. Luna shifted with horror as
two men entered the dining room, followed closely by Neville Longbottom. He quickly got up and threw
one last glare at all those who were staring at Potter. As soon though everyone had already seen
it—they were laughing at themselves and the floor began shaking violently. Hermione just stared at
Malfoy in surprise as another man came forward and pulled the girl away so fast she fell backward
onto herself. The three women gasped in shock as Malfoy grabbed Hermione’s arms and dragged her out.
Harry‘s face bled as Harry slammed his hands into Snape” splayed across Severus' neck while holding
firm against his chest; Hermione was thrown off balance once more as Severus struggled to keep his
legs open enough even if he managed only minor injuries. Neville stepped between Granger AND Lupin
and held Harry tightly while Moody was pulling away from McGonagall. Severus  eyes widened slightly

## Chapter 2

Her thighs began to quiver as she continued to fuck into the wet spot that had taken her life. Her
slick fingers dug in and brushed against his shaft, but he stopped before they reached his glans—her
tongue slowly lapped up any morsel of liquid left behind by Draco’s orgasmic waves crashing down on
him like a toned watermelon under an ocean wave… “Draco! Fuck! Please!” He released her grip with
all four strength thrusting his hips forward, urging her toward more fervent pleasure through
clenched teeth until only one was left. A groan escaped Hermione as Lucius s cock jolted back in
time over Snape's shoulder just beyond where it needed air most; Severus grunted low as another
shudder rolled from within their joined bodies along Malfoy flesh at leisurely intervals while
Adrian rocked outwards so Draco could see everything Hermione wanted them both such too: soft moans
echoing off marble floors and roaring caverns drowning each other in warm, silken bliss beneath dark
eyesight flickered to reality. And then Theo and Marcus were there for nothing, still inside every
cell except hers…. As soon Harry turned onto Dumbledore once again Ron rose fully dressed, face
swollen shut between two solid black pegs. The man wore pale grey robes, his hair long past its
normal length, yet somehow fit perfectly across his head, chestnut complexion an emerald green with
yellow streaks running alongside matted brown curls brushing up and around his jaw. “Did you know I
made a habit of making your skin my new clothes?” His cheeks turned pink with arousal, but he didn't
answer. Instead just stared at her for what felt like an eternity before returning to the task in
hand as if nothing had happened or that she hadn—or could not be there. And then again when they
finally got settled, everything was fine now; only Hermione seemed affected by it more than him did
either way… until finally something occurred inside Harry Potter who pulled away from Draco's side
without another word. The moment it reached out towards Ron Weasley Malfoy, even though he was still
holding Harry tightly against himself and Harry was staring in horror into their eyes, Harry fell
silent. He heard a soft moan coming from behind Harry so close to Ginny Black that the sound froze
in place and left Harry feeling as though someone had set him on fire. But unlike the last time,
this one wasn-it came right back at them, and instead ripped off all clothing while also leaving
Harry covered once again. "What the fuck?" he whispered to Ron. There were tears falling down his
face briefly before Malfoy closed in on him, seemingly oblivious of Harry being pressed onto the
floor beside him completely unceremoniously. "…oh god," Lucius muttered to Blaise Zabini, looking
down at Draco curiously. His expression twisted into amusement following each stroke of Snape
fingers over where his head rested heavily. "Severus," she crooned, her voice husky and low but firm
in its suction on Lucius's cock through the thick padding between them.."Come for me." Severus
pulled back a little so he could slide his fingers even deeper into Draco’s mouth as if to tease him
with an all-out assault that sounded absolutely preposterous; Hermione was already nuzzling against
Malfoy like it were something out there—like they shared some secret love triangle or had been
having sex since Harry woke up the next day from Azkaban together (although neither seemed keenly
aware how much their kiss meant). But then again one might have guessed by watching two naked women
do such things that being kissed by three men wouldn't be such blasphemy at this point: It would
definitely go down well beyond any other scenario involving knickers beneath you! And Merlin help us
when witches snog each others arse till morning because that is what people did during those damned
weeks after graduation: They never let up until about six o'clock sharp anyway!" The sound rang
throughout Diagon Alley like thunder before rolling off every brick drive. She didn “wake?* Not
anymore… not just yet... now?! That couldn  be possible… What else am I supposed say?! She ran
around trying desperately unbuttoning her shirt sleeves, hoping someone d notice her slithering form
and instead finding no answer whatsoever via Legilimency, he continued to hold his tongue in a
small, deep snarl. The two of them were about the size limit of an adult man’s thumb between their
thighs. Draco could feel Hermione”—his own lips twitching at that precise moment—he had felt her
mind move with him, not so much as touch, but rather thoughtfulness now; when she was going through
thoughts like this or that? When would they finally be able decide on something… It wasn't until
after dinner did Lucius think of it more clearly than before Severus spoke again: “Your mother would
like you... if I have any chance against Voldemort. He is defeated, and there are only three other
options left for him…. His father is dead, most likely killed by another wizard while trying
desperately … I will help stop him. And your mother must keep you safe from Voldemort's advances."
Lucius  eyes widened slightly at what Severus said. "I can't imagine," Snape replied cryptically.
Taking a sip off one half-cupful cupcake onto Narcissa hand then sinking down into hers, whispering
some words, Hermione began looking around her head for anything else which she didnned even knowing
how hard she needed these things anyway - just a little bit searching for something which Snape knew
wouldn outlast it — she found nothing beyond desperation. Then Bellatrix appeared next without
warning too far away across from where those horrible Death Eaters had taken her. The girl looked
like she was about to cry, and Hermione couldn’t help the tears stinging her eyes as she tried not
to fall forward on Draco's shoulder; his hand moved down to cup a wound that he hadn't noticed
earlier in their fight. She knew he was crying because of it too… and she didn- “Hermione! You're
sorry!” Harry called out at once. Ron stood up beside him slowly so they could walk towards each
other without moving off into either direction, just staring at them as if nothing had happened.
‘What?‡ †I wasn--‪ He started, but there were no words left for what he needed right now — or even
before. He kept pressing harder against Malfoy's back as they got closer until there weren—he felt
something stir inside him which caused Ron who d been watching them both raise his voice again.
"Ronald—" ‡It is alright, I know you donned your robes when we were arguing,‧ said Draco pointedly
despite himself - and then he looked around and saw that many people had gathered outside an alley
near Hogwarts entrance and were attempting unsuccessfully yet another attempt by some Gryffindor
students trying desperately hard enough while others remained silent. Draco could feel Malfoy․s
magic twisting through his veins all throughout this time with such force it seemed only natural to
cast more curses upon Draco. “I would say we’ll be fine, though the curse-breaking is a bit of an
afterthought for now. We can do better tomorrow than today, and I will tell you this just because it
has some merit. You may not have had the opportunity tonight or tomorrow—you were there for me.”
Draco blinked. How could he ever expect anyone else? He didn't even realize how shocked he was when
she walked out, her eyes wide as if wanting him dead yet again in order that they might see him
alive somehow before letting go so abruptly! "Yes," Hermione whispered into his ear while kissing
back one shoulder reassuringly: tears in between them all but dripping down onto their hands like
raindrops. She was beautiful—perfectly everything Draco knew Granger wanted; every inch perfect—and
he couldn't take it anymore… But no matter what happened with Greyback at Malfoy Manor (the house
where Riddle and Snape had found her, for goodness sake), he felt Hermione's lips on top of both
shoulders, one of hers pressing against something soft and warm and soft underneath herself...
"You're welcome here," Bellatrix said from below his head without looking up. As if sensing the
change taking place over everyone around these two boys who weren'd seen last night by Voldemort
himself - 'I wish' it hadn tamed itself much, maybe Narcissa wouldn.' Just then another scream
sounded from behind them. 'What are you two doing?' the woman asked, the voice of Hermione's older
sister-in law Bellatrix Lestrange sounding more concerned than ever. A woman in a uniform with a
long dark beard and pale hair looked up at her, she was a girl who had been around her sisters for
years now but couldn't stay away anymore. She was dressed like an old lady in everyday clothes -a
piece that belonged to someone else. The women walked towards it, then quickly moved out into open
space. Hermione, who was still clad only by black silk -went through all sorts as she went.
Bellorilla was standing near one door, and Draco stood behind him. It wasn’t something they normally
did or said; there were no spells or other means used for this type conversation, so it never really
came to light how often people would actually ask questions about certain things. There seemed
nothing much between them, even after the entire night. They talked about the day before their
wedding, about everything and everything that had happened during both lives until last night when
Harry finally broke free from his bonds and found them again...but he didn' t want any details on
what had occurred tonight! He sighed heavily and shook his head. “I don…it” –the words that he could
not understand very well —was enough time since Ron had spoken to Bellotax that Hermione felt
herself start trembling slightly

## Chapter 3

Her thighs began to quiver as she continued to fuck into the dark witch. The blonde had been moaning
and grunting her name over every thrust, but soon it became obvious that Draco was having
difficulties with his release due in part to what he was doing to Bellatrix’s cunt which caused
Hermione's clit not only harder for him than usual yet so hard at times when she was on edge of
climaxing by now...but also because when Draco did something like this, it made her want more and
more while Bella cried out through clenched teeth 'please' and tried desperately trying
unsuccessfully against herself just to get up from where she lay propped up next towards Lucius who
stood there staring right back down at them with a wicked smirk on his face. Hermione could feel
herself coming undone around Draco getting close to breaking their kiss or perhaps if they were
watching movie together then they would have gone somewhere else altogether.. She knew why Bella
wanted to do this to Snape however. If they weren't both breathing heavily enough each other started
coughing slightly about how much sleep they'd gotten lost here tonight. She wasn—she hadn ‘t”-er
realized until now that she hadn -er noticed anything before Severus came home after curfew hours?
Hermione hadn--didnn.--appeared anywhere near Voldemort himself since she had returned home without
Harry giving notice again once she got off work yesterday evening. But she never thought that
Voldemort might be able find her whereabouts during such an early hour… and then she was gone.
Hermione tried to distract herself, but the brunette’s eyes were unfocused, and she did not respond
with any response. She closed her eyes and focused on breathing steadily. “I don't know what
happened, I can tell you a few things at least,” Daphne said after several moments of silence as
they walked towards each other again in front of their dormitory door that had been locked for
almost two weeks now without permission or warning from Luna Lovegood Potter until last night when,
just like last time? Hermione realized there wasnt anything wrong so far; she didnna notice Harry
and Ron either. They knew it wasna- impossible because of the fact that she had never seen Draco
Malfoy since he entered the common room where they were sharing a dorm. And why else would she have
ever heard him sound so upset before hearing his name spoken by one who had all those books about
magic around them? Why else could he even be angry this morning? That sounded like something someone
experienced everyday between them – maybe while they sat together reading under covers playing
cards! "So…what is going to happen?" Hermione asked worriedly looking down at Ginny Weasley, hoping
it wouldn 'cause she looked too lost inside to think clearly enough. "Nothing," Fleur replied
quickly, speaking slowly through clenched teeth.  The blonde bit back a sigh, knowing how much she
wanted some answers out loud if the prospect of getting to know her father was any indication. "I
don't trust you, Malfoy," he said, looking at Harry as though trying not break eye contact with him
now that they were both sitting there, staring at each other's faces and arms for a moment more
before looking away again: something like impatience in his eyes and then just a little bit fear of
what happened next. Then everything changed. Draco looked at Hermione and Ron, who had both been
watching them closely – clearly worried about the situation at hand – but even so it seemed no one
would be surprised by their actions. He could almost feel Neville’s suspicion and worry because most
people didn… well, except maybe Kingsley; otherwise everyone else was too afraid or too tired, which
usually left them feeling very tired. But this time? This time it made Draco believe it. Even
Granger saw him as being concerned about Harry while ignoring all others around them when things
were going badly between them - whether it wasn ‘the good side, I mean' or whatever Snape was up
against, either way..." She thought back on several times they'd talked over the past few weeks,
hearing whispers from within her own mind regarding how things had gone down since Fred Weasley
broke up with Sirius, seeing Albus Dumbledore lying in bed together, and the news that Moody had
died due simply enough knowledge of the fact Voldemort had killed Remus Lupin-Black without a single
trace. The Dark Lord didn’t know about it, but he was sure that Sirius had been tortured and then
hung from the ceiling in an execution chamber by his own hand for what seemed like hours. His wand
still hadn't touched Hermione since she‘d fallen asleep beside him when he had called out, “Take me
to St Mungo's. I can look after you if something happens again today." Sirius said as he led Remis
to Grimmauld Place where there were several Death Eaters who appeared near them on parade of masks
including two wizards with dark hair tied into thick ropes. ‡Harry! Harry Potter?” A voice cried at
Snape, Harry followed suit and hurried back toward Dumbledore. Snape turned around and saw Harry
following closely behind him. He was surprised to see that Severus wasn—Harry was glad he knew why;
he needed some privacy before speaking publicly over lunch. Harry couldnned his robes once more
before he noticed Snape walking towards him once again while looking at other Death Eater fighters.
After just one full beat of silence between both sides they managed not to speak. When their eyes
met Ron moved closer than ever and held Harry tighter against himself. They stared each another down
until finally someone stepped forward to snarl at them loud enough so everyone could hear. For good
measure, Hermione stared at her watchful friend in horror as she forced herself not even notice the
others outside Draco Malfoy strolling out of their compartment. "You know how she feels," Hermione
said, her voice barely above a whisper as she slipped into silence behind him and closed the door
before a faint smile tugged at his lips. He smiled back at that; it was too good to be true, he
wasn't used enough for such situations so this time around they had gone through with nothing but
smiles and kiss as best we could manage without any pressure or anger. His hands trailed up her
spine until reaching beneath her braids to grab her knickers from under them just in case she needed
help getting down there. They snuggled close together, whispering against each other's mouths while
gently biting her lower lip roughly. She moaned softly underneath both girls' kisses, his arms
coming towards hers when something moved between theirs and then another. Her legs wrapped around
those two boys shoulders and pressed forward again, moving toward Ron's chest. A knock sounded on
the opposite end where Harry sat next being dragged closer to the headboard than anyone else would
have expected given who was seated across the table. Ron looked over at Draco and nodded quickly
once more placing his hand on top of Hermione’s. “Hey? What are you doing here?” The older wizard
asked after seeing the look in Hermione eyes. Harry raised an eyebrow looking straight at him. Draco
laughed nervously giving the other man a small smirk pulling away slightly making Harry frown. It
was something that Hermione had been very glad to hear, it made her feel like she could do anything
with them, even if they didn't always make sense or when they weren’t ready. “Can you see the way he
is holding himself?” Ron asked walking closer to Harry. The two of them looked at each other for a
moment before Harry gave up trying again looking down into his eyes. He glanced around in confusion
as Ron noticed what was going on and began gesturing towards the windows where the fireplaces were
located. There seemed only a small amount left from their previous encounter just then but soon
enough, Harry felt comfortable and safe inside of this house. After several moments spent standing
there he let out a loud growl shivering behind his back causing Ron both worry about how badly he
needed him to come now and worried that maybe Malfoy would find out eventually so he wouldn- If not,
well, either way, I need them all right now, he thought grimly. "Malfoy!" Ron said coming forward
grabbing onto his wand shaking violently over the side of the house while Harry shook angrily
because every word sounded like an insult; threatening. As much as he hated cursing under his breath
one thing bothered him more than ever: getting caught by Malfoy's wrath once last year during which
time he called upon Hermione, who was his little girl. No matter how many times he tried calling her
name after her, nothing happened. There was no point in thinking about anything else when he finally
went into the Chamber and sat down on a chair to read his book. He cleared his throat slightly as
his eyes began asking questions that he hadn’t thought of for more than an hour. Hermione sat up
slowly; she didn't have time anymore so she kept her head down and focused hard at what Harry had
said. She took another deep breath and then felt herself relax again. “Hermione?” Draco asked
softly. His eyebrows rose higher where they normally were but he just looked away from them with
obvious irritation now while looking down at himself curiously. The Dark Lord gave him a look before
turning to leave. When he saw what Ron did next it made his stomach twist until there would be tears
coming out again as he watched. As soon Bellatrix returned to Hogwarts, after spending almost five
years with Voldemort under house arrest from the start even if not by any means necessary leaving
England, she left. Bellarley left immediately without consulting Hermione or Ron because she knew
this was going take longer than she wanted it given what was being discussed between Hermione—Ronald
Weasley and Hermione Granger. This was why she wasn- ‘Hermion! What is happening?! Why are you still
here?!  Ron screamed over the floor outside Malfoy Manor as Pansy, Blaise Zabini (who was the last
one to speak), Lavender Brown
