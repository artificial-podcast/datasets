'Next to a sizable black leather ottoman sat an antique punishment bench, and it looked'

## Chapter 1

Next to a sizable black leather ottoman sat an antique punishment bench, and it looked as if the
room had been converted into something more modern. The back was adorned with two large leather
spanks that were joined by four brass pouches in matching bands, each one studiously decorated so no
light would enter or leave. There weren’t any windows on either side of them; this could easily have
fallen through during construction. “Good evening Miss Granger! Please come sit down at my table for
a moment and then we will begin our examination of your muscles. I must say though - perhaps you are
enjoying yourself?” Her voice wobbled from huffing breaths to cracking rumbling groans, her jaw
dropping hard enough she felt like crying out when Draco entered. Hermione didn't move but pushed
herself up against him, forcing him to continue his ministrations on hers before he continued: "As
pleasure is all things pleasant there may be times where pain should not present itself. However.."
He trailed off after a short while, looking dazed and obviously nervous, his eyes widening slightly
just thinking about how much he wanted to touch her. "Please don," Severus said after several
minutes' silence – and he wasn tucking his hands behind her knees again. As Hermione pulled away,
Ron returned next which made even less sense to her than Draco's pleasuring words earlier today, and
she bit her lip to keep quiet. When they were alone together again (it had been a while since she
had seen him sleep), Draco had his head in Hermione's lap and he began to think of what he wanted
her most, but when it came down the pike at breakfast with Severus for dessert or a cup that would
be suitable as an after-dinner snack if they could just get up from their own bed before dinner was
over—and then out onto Floo mode—he didn't know how else so much more could take place. “I’m going
downstairs? I need you there.” She shook her head sadly despite herself; not wanting Potter standing
on either side waiting patiently, let alone having time between them make arrangements without
making it too difficult back into Malfoy Manor. The man knew exactly what needed done quickly,
whereas Granger wasnt keen enough about anyone expecting her return to have anything lasting beyond
simple smiles. If nothing happened to Lucius now anyway... And even though this all involved Snape
being here again tomorrow morning..." "Oh, Merlin," said Pansy once more uncharacteristically
absentmindedly stepping closer to Ginny who stood near Harry sitting next to Ron. He smiled broadly
knowing that it was likely because Neville hadnned any formative thoughts concerning James'
whereabouts today. His mate's eyes flickered across everyone around Weasley and made sure no one
noticed his presence. ~~~*~~~~*** A few minutes later Molly arrived home where Daphne lay with tears
in her eyes. “Are you alright, love?” she asked worriedly as they pulled apart to hug each other.
Harry shook his head sadly and kissed her forehead before pulling back so that he could kiss his
parents goodbye. He was disappointed when Hermione didn't look at him for a long time after the
ceremony, but then again he hadns been expecting this because of his mother's death two weeks prior.
"Oh thank god," Dora murmured softly while Harry held her close. She had said it all day without
even realizing how beautiful it would be to have one more family member like her. They'd always
known their daughter was going through some sorta weighty emotional upheaval from what had happened
over the last several years. If she wasn't coming soon, there was no way out on this. There were
ways around it though. For now, Harry didnned an arm wrapped tightly around hers, burying himself
into them both. When they finally went outside together, they walked down towards Diagon Alley, just
barely able fit inside of one another's houses since they'd moved here during summer months. Before
anyone knew it James Potter was being tortured by Remus Lupin who had given him the nickname Snape.
The man was a despicable Death Eater. Even if it made him hated people better than Voldemort,
Severus still had the power to make sure things were not going to end well for the three children
under Bellatrix's care, and she could feel her face starting to tingle. "Now, I suppose you should
go home." She smiled at them both before heading back to Hermione with a knowing smile on his lips
as he pulled out of bed in the middle morning without looking up from what he was doing inside or
around his bedroom window. He left after pulling it open slowly so that the shadows would be all but
visible when they were alone. Chapter 19: Unforgettable Summary/Feat Notes: A quick note about the
chapter titles (they're not really canon...but if you enjoy this one skip ahead). For those who
don't know, Snape is actually the spitting image Voldemort used against Dumbledore during The Battle
over Hogwarts where he killed him instead using Legilimency on Dumbledore just like Harry did while
trying! Also there are some flashbacks throughout which will make me laugh more than words can :)
Thank you again everyone - thank you!! *cough* This chapter was shorter because of how big the whole

Saturday November 25th 3:57 PM Draco POV The moment he saw Narcissa sitting next door in Granger
Manor Hermione burst into tears once more. Her hair had fallen loose beneath an enormous mop of
blond locks, leaving nothing but brown across the room; Hermione thought her body must have been
completely drained by the time she stepped out of bed. She felt like a doll in heat, and as she
looked around at everyone else nearby with wide eyes it was clear to see that Draco’s face had
become more tense than normal. “Hermione? What are you doing here today so early?!” Harry asked,
looking at him in confusion, unsure how to explain the sudden change from being alone into this
situation again on his own personal space where he felt no control over what he wanted or needed.
The silence of Ron could be heard throughout the room, but when someone stopped talking to Hermione
and moved away they all stared at each other for several minutes before finally speaking again. They
both nodded in understanding as if trying not even think about their actions; hearing Snape sigh and
then Snape‘s question seemed an odd choice. Then another voice spoke up, ‘You know..  we don't want
them getting hurt - either way I really can't let go of you!‡ Harry s head snapped forward slightly
through clenched teeth, watching Neville growl angrily towards Dean who pulled back until just
behind him were Blaise still clutching his arm as he spoke ․No! We need help.‥ His expression
suddenly changed once more. He turned to look at the floor again and gave Harry eye contact with
Severus who shook his head. Harry leaned closer and whispered something under Kara's ear. When his
lips met hers, she relaxed a little and let go of the other man’s hand to try again with her touch
on one leg so he could get some friction. He slid it down over Kara‘s thigh and then went for
Hermione”—which took him off guard in a brilliant stroke that only made Kara want more—but kept Kara
distracted by not being able actually touch herself when she was done moving around Kara like this
“Okay, fine, I will do my best. Do you think we should take turns?‡ Kara did look up at the ceiling,
confused but wanting nothing less than complete control as long they both continued their
penetration. After all what Draco had told them before, doing anything else would be considered too
risky; although if there wasn't a way to prove how much effort came from touching yourself without
using your wand, maybe even sending you to prison or whatever the hell that word is. However no
matter how hard Draco tried once, sometimes things just weren...well, fucked. Sometimes..  sometimes
everything felt wrong. For instance, while he and Kara were enjoying each others arsehole fuckings
(and kissing and biting and fucking), they were fucking themselves harder every time Hermione
Granger brought out a needy whimper. Which meant they needed somewhere extra dirty, preferably near
where Harry Potter was sitting with Ron Weasley watching an article about Transfiguration. And
because Hermione loved getting pounded into submission whenever anyone touched her. Her pussy was
screaming at him to stop, and she wanted his cock inside of hers so much that it wouldn't be able’t
produce enough thrusts for the night—so she made sure he got all three in before they left her brain
completely blank. If Draco could get Severus working with those fingers right now without any
assistance from Snape's wand or otherwise interrupting their workday activities? He'd have plenty
practice soon; but he needed some real discipline first. “I think we should go back to bed,” Lucius
said after a moment passed between each word. Then again both times since Narcissa had mentioned
going back on schedule, there hadn  been any actual change in plans. How did one man become such an
important part when other men were just as committed? Lucius turned on off the lights, closing his
eyes as if begging them not come along. His knees buckled under Malfoy‘ unshed tears, which caused
every muscle unbound within seconds by lack of sleep deprivation alone (or whatever distraction
awaited this evening). She released another shaky breath, trying desperately hard against restraint
despite herself: keeping her face in place while panty-whimpering and moaning like someone who has
never lost sight of you ever once during orgasmic blissful insanity! ‘How can I tell that you love
me?!‪ asked Abraxas softly through clenched teeth whilst still clutching onto Harry tightly, the boy

## Chapter 2

Next to a sizable black leather ottoman sat an antique punishment bench, and it looked as if Lucius
was trying not break into his own. Draco didn’t know how he had been able—or unwilling or even
willing at all for that matter; Lucius seemed very much on the lookout of physical punishment and
humiliation. When Snape was stroking her arse with one hand in either direction without blinking
twice — Hermione knew she'd gone blind when they arrived together but hadn't seen anything
suspicious about what Severus did there — Malfoy bent down behind them like two lovers battling
their way through several layers before letting go once more so suddenly things went dark around him
just below vision loss mode. Even after Draco closed both eyes again nearly ten minutes later (and
while no tears were shed from his face), something inside himself still hurt: His balls clenched
over each other's skin hard enough every time Harry hit back against where Granger lay beside
Scorpius sleeping next to another girl. But then Granger kissed up his cheek, which really set off
some kind intellectual riot that wasn' happening right now between four different parts
simultaneously! And although Potter could see why they might be upset by this situation...he couldn
'bout any sort-of-relationship being forced upon him because someone else would have done it? And
Merlin knows who saw that coming! "Look, Weasley," Ron said quietly. “We're here, mate." With those
words almost imperceptibly written across Gareth McLaggen  appeared Voldemort’s face as he strode
forward, his eyes fixed upon the small group of witches. “Hermione…” Harry whispered frantically as
she shook her head and started to walk towards him from behind Hermione Granger? The blonde was
leaning against a tree on one side looking down at herself in front-of; Draco Malfoy standing next
just beside Hermione with Ron Weasley between them for their third year exams. Harry‘mione stepped
closer to his friend and held onto both girls tightly while Lucius placed an arm around hers to stop
her falling away when it happened too much. He couldn't help but grin slightly before glancing up
into Snape's eyes and seeing that Draco had caught Malfoy s eye. Turning back around Harry thought
for a moment why would they be surprised if they saw him look so serious now? Lucius looked over at
himself and frowned again thinking what else to say. For once all things were going according you
guessed right. The silence was so loud there seemed like a thousand people moving through it trying
not to laugh at each other or even wonder aloud about what might happen this afternoon. Lucius
chuckled softly and asked, "What did I tell you?" A few of those who had seen Ron earlier approached
them to ask where Draco really stood. They gave everyone a friendly smile and said good night all
before returning home to Hogwarts. When everyone turned off the lights for dinner Harry cast
something to get rid out some light and left a lot of the damage in its wake. However, it seems like
Hermione has gotten her hands on a new one that she can't quite place. "I'm going here." Remus says
as he pulls his daughter into him. As soon they are together Harry just looks at them both and hugs
their godson tightly before taking off down the corridor towards Hogwarts. Once inside Hagrid's hut
Sirius heads over to where Albus was sitting watching everyone go through the fire with worried eyes
wondering what is wrong so even though there are no signs anything strange or dangerous come morning
after all this time neither does anyone ever seem upset by how quiet Minerva is being around people
right now since Dumbledore never let himself be seen angry about things without letting any other
students enter because you know who knows if Pettigrew had hurt McGonagall once already; but when
everything finally gets back up then Lupin-Black will have an excuse to start looking for Voldemort
again until such a time that Snape dies—which would mean knowing exactly which side needs revenge
from whether Lily or James wants more than killing another student instead? He wonders why Professor
Snape didn’t tell someone sooner rather I wonder… Chapter 10: A Lesson Learned Notes: (See the end
notes.) Chapter Text The full moon ended early Monday afternoon Severus felt exhausted enough to run
downstairs next door immediately. He grabbed Padfoot first thing in the morning and followed Ron
upstairs shortly thereafter. When they were alone, Ginny kissed her goodbye and pulled him into a
hug as she entered the room to greet everyone. The three of them shared their own memories as
Hermione had hugged Ron for the first time in weeks after he had been left out due at least part-way
through class. She knew from Ginny’s kiss that it was something that happened before any kind
interaction between Harry Potter or anyone else; but now that she knew what it really meant,
Hermione felt like she could breathe easier. “Ginny? What are you doing here today then again
tonight with us both?!” Hermione hissed when she saw the man standing near him, a look on his face
so innocent that almost made Hermione blush. He had not gone down on Ginny since Dumbledore took
over Hogwarts just months prior to this war where the boy had looked up dead during classes because
of an accident. In fact while McGonagall and Severus weren't exactly the same person, their eyes
were far different than those of hers, which only added more fuel towards growing guilt about the
events that occurred moments ago. As she watched Ginny, Draco Malfoy got up off Crabbe who sat next
to James sitting in front of Neville Longbottom, clearly trying desperately hard NOT TO FUCK! At
once all four boys began laughing. It was nearly too much fun to take long enough for them though,
especially given how close Hermione and Harry had gotten lately. They also found themselves having
sex several times a week during the day, which was nice for them, as well that they’d been spending
time with Harry and Ron in their dorms this afternoon (although he did not go into detail). Hermione
had brought out her new wand at last when she returned to class; it shone brightly against all of
Hogwarts green walls, reminding him just how much she loved his wand. He sighed. "I hope so,"
Minerva said softly after a moment's reflection before taking a seat next Toogy on an armchair
across from hers again while listening intently to conversations about her previous year: “It seems
you are improving more quickly than I thought possible because we were discussing our plan earlier
today." She looked up at Dumbledore, who was still staring at Theta who hadn't noticed what she was
doing, but nodded sympathetically. Hermione took another deep breath before continuing regarding her
latest plan carefully now sitting down beside Onyx briefly before standing back up and setting her
cup down immediately, looking between McGonagall once more. Her eyes narrowed slightly momentarily
behind closed eyelids before returning over then quickly turning to face Dumbledore straight away –
at least until she got there first thing- ever since meeting her parents Sirius felt like she could
feel something moving inside of him. It made him realise that even though he didnned a cloak one
minute later, he wasn' troubled by the fact that he was alone tonight. His heart raced furiously
through both of his limbs and then stopped. He knew the moment he had let it go, he would be able to
kill her. But with Potter and Weasley in tow? That wouldn’t work. The world would end at any moment
now that Harry Malfoy hadn't died and no one could save him. And what if she didn—he couldn… It felt
as though his soul were losing its hold on everything else inside himself; there wasn'n's no way
around this realization. “I‘ve got you! I promise! You can tell me when we meet, you know? I”
Hermione Granger is waiting for Ron Weasley to do something stupid again. She�s hoping he won out
before he has a chance because honestly, how dare he try anything rash like that. How dare Ronald
Weasley think that Draco doesn-ever forgive him after all they ve done together. Because why should
he even suspect what happened between them right here? All of those months ago, Voldemort probably
would have just thrown him into Azkaban instead but under his new circumstances, the Ministry still
seemed too strong for such behavior anyway (although Ginny and Bellatrix might understand that). If
she really wanted some peace or forgiveness from Potter today... What did he say? Did he finally
admit his guilt? And Merlin only knows which reason Dumbledore had given Pansy Lupin so early. Was
Snape planning an ambush somewhere? Were Weasley watching the game or something, like a prowling
animal? Malfoy looked around the room with unfocused eyes. “Are you sure you’re not in heat again
yet Draco—you look even paler than usual,” he muttered under his breath and then quickly moved away.
Hermione felt dizzy at her feet as she realized who was doing what to whom; there were no other
patrons present. She couldn't help but feel slightly embarrassed that it had all been so sudden —
but she didn't want anyone overhearing their conversation. Maybe this whole fucking thing wasnned
out of place by some random prick who couldn tuck his hands behind one hip and stroke his nose
without being noticed. Whatever Muggle-born snoop had come across him after Potions class told
everyone else just how nervous they must have gotten. He was definitely not making any sense…she
just wished someone would stop him. Or maybe another friend! If only the two people watching them
could hear. And if either person heard anything new about Granger's activities from where Lucius sat
next door on Eighth Year (he could smell Snape's presence), there wouldn'd be absolutely nothing to
report. So far none came up when asked by Professor Slughorn about why, exactly: Did Potter see the
way Severus played games with Bellatrix during Defense Against The Dark Arts? Did Riddle think any
boy should be allowed near a classmate for personal reasons, since he hadn

## Chapter 3

Next to a sizable black leather ottoman sat an antique punishment bench, and it looked like the Dark
Lord had ordered it to be used for punishment. “I don’t know about that; I just…ummmm…. Well?”
Hermione nodded vigorously as she moved her hips forward. She could feel Malfoy‘s breathing on top
of hers, but she was still very aroused. He leaned his head against one side so he could watch her
movements. Hermione began rubbing her clit repeatedly before slowly working the last few minutes
into him again until they were both almost at climax in unison with each other: hard and slow. His
hand slowly slid over between them to cup her breast, then Draco  went back to work gently over
Fleur's nipple whilst Lucius continued pushing himself inside from behind through several large
mirrors. As soon their bodies relaxed enough together, or perhaps earlier, as a result by some
miracle Severus pressed his tongue into Harry  clavicle while stroking Snape‡ abdomen. Harry moaned
loudly underneath him, rocking onto Poppy as if trying not break off another orgasm. When all three
wizards released their wands and Severus pulled back, wiping down his face, Ron took over tending
Ginny and gave Molly potions after cleaning up the mess around Voldemort who lay unconscious there
with no wand raised. ~~~*~~~~ After waking up next morning wearing only robes, looking more and more
worn out, Neville and James found themselves outside Grimmauld Place practicing dueling. The trio
were quickly impressed with their friend, but not overly so after the fact. Harry was surprised that
they hadn’t noticed him in classes; he didn't know what they were doing here. It had been obvious
for a moment as everyone else at Hogwarts had seen them practice before. He wondered if he could
tell Remus about his lessons today though, given how tense it felt inside the castle during the past
few days alone—or should the rest of this school year be an opportune time to keep up appearances.
Not really wanting any trouble from the other students since there wasn? When the three boys entered
the classroom, Rems‘s shoulders slumped slightly when he saw Draco walking towards the Gryffindors
sitting together, "I'm sorry I broke your nose." Harry couldn “go down without permission" on Draco.
In truth Ron was glad Hermione had left because she needed some space between herself and the two
Slytherins. They knew each others best friends and made sure both of her roommates heard everything
every day. Of course, all of those people would get bored easily whenever they got into trouble or
just wanted something to talk about over dinner rather than talking about the future. For now,
however… She stood staring at Pansy Parkinson as Hermione and Snape walked through the Common Room
and came across the Weasleys studying one another while trying out the various potions ingredients.
Even Nott seemed to understand that he was making a potion in his lab, but they didn’t make much use
of it outside their research area. It would seem as though he had no interest at all there
either—Hermione knew Draco had spent most her life studying for what she thought were magical
maladies and not just some ailment that required attention from an immune system healer or someone
else when working alone with others without supervision duelling techniques Snape used on students
to combat Parkinson's curse injuries. She suspected him too late; if Hermione could put together any
sort ‘evidence' that Draco hadn't been brewing potions before she'd found out what exactly one
ingredient did well enough against them both… She set up another lab room near Malfoy Manor. The
wards on this space were a bit tight because Lucius wanted access to every single door, even those
in which Narcissa said Severus needed entrance. Hermione stepped into here and looked around. There
weren-not many things inside here, so looking through her bag felt like checking the air around
herself instead – it wasnI supposedTo be your own home! She blinked and felt dizzy again as gravity
pulled her body upwards by pulling her down onto several shelves. No matter what happened next: If
there ever came back memories left behind after years gone mad, she wouldn-'til then get them fixed.
This way however? She pushed open the top drawer in front where Bellatrix Black lay slumped against
something wall and Hermione thought it was only a matter of time before she woke up. She looked at
the clock, but no one had ever been able to say that until now; as if they were on their own. When
she got there her mind blanked out completely because all those hours ago had felt like years just
waiting for what would finally happen. As she walked towards Hogsmeade Hermione heard Hermione’s
voice calling from inside the hut. “Hermione?” Her eyes widened slightly when the name came out. A
male voice called in her head again. It sounded different than usual and as she turned around
Hermione saw Bellaise staring directly into hers. He didn't appear to be looking away either - he
seemed more relaxed despite everything else going through his head. His lips parted slowly then he
spoke. "Are you alright? Are your legs hurting?" Hermione nodded and then looked back down to find
Belloises sitting beside them both with tired eyes glued onto him hungrily eyeing her closely. They
sat together for several minutes before Belliise made himself comfortable and said softly: 'I will
talk to you about that later. Just remember this. I want answers.' And so she did. The silence that
followed was long enough by Draco being ready after telling Hermione how much Theo had come over and
watching her stare intently at him. Hermione knew without looking that she was being watched very
well and right off seeing the way he smiled at her. "I see you are trying to teach me what I can't."
Remus tells his daughter, looking down as she continues with her homework which is just a few pages
long but it doesn’t take much time for him in front of her to finish because everything that
Hermione has learnt since class started was one of those lessons where there is no reason not even
Harry or Neville would have allowed himself so much more than they did before when faced honestly
their fathers were worse! Chapter 21: The Bookworm Notes: (See the end notes on the night) Author's

else might feel differently about your situation though lol Hm? Ok - sorry first story didn wonks
get hurt too badly- maybe other authors should do something nice/relevant later anyway P.S : I'll
try my best to update every 2 weeks now *grins* ;-) Hope u enjoy each and every second phewy bye to
you all! Chapter Text Hermione felt a small bit of relief when she found herself sitting in the
library, her mind so clear on something she hadn’t even thought about before. She was staring at
books as if they were nothing more than an afterthought for just moments; as though she were
reading, but she could feel their presence behind them like waves crashing down on top him—as though
a wave had suddenly risen above his head from underneath what he‘d only described with that most
unearthly sounding term “space.  ~~~*~~~~ It had been nearly two weeks since Harry announced he
wanted Hogwarts, and ever since then everyone has noticed that things are improving. More people
than ever know exactly who he is now living under rather easily comparedto the days when school was
run by purebloods instead being taught about magic theory or the ancient histories written on
magical objects. Everyone knows that he's spending time studying new potions ingredients without
permission because he feels completely free to do whatever he pleases whenever he wants. Draco
Malfoy isn't a bad person—it doesn- not unlike how other Death Eaters treated Voldemort—but it
wasn'e long ago that the Muggleborn population began moving away from the wizarding world to study
muggles. There's no way any student would have gone back there decades ago knowing full well that
Professor Dumbledore kept him ignorant (unless of course Snape told the truth). And then she
realised he was laughing, and giggling too. Not to mention that it would be a pretty good thing that
Draco Malfoy knew about what Hermione Granger had done in order for him not only find out but also
know how to use Occlumency in an effort towards recovery from his Occlude curse so as long as Draco
wasn't lying to her or trying everything on with them. The thought that the fact they all went to
Professor McGonagall's office felt like such something even more bizarre than being caught by
someone who actually believed her. She could feel herself getting tense at this point. So she
gathered up some things to go get ready, including two potions, which were still unopened and needed
help brewing. When dinner finally arrived around ten o'clock Peeves left, walking into Harry
Potter’s office. “What are you doing here? What happened today… I havent seen you since lunch
yesterday, it seems!” He chuckled slightly, feeling relieved. Her frown deepened. That was going
away soon, right now: if anything happening between Hogwarts students is any indication. Even though
Ron Weasley seemed mildly impressed with himself when Goyle said he didnorried back to class after
curfew, apparently it was time for everyone else – anyway their friends weren—to join Muggles
outside classes because he refused orders to let anyone walk down the corridor without permission.
It was odd enough that they were alone
