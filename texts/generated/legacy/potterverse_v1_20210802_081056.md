'"Shh," she murmurs, cupping my cheek with her free hand, "Let go. I've got you."'

## Chapter 1

"Shh," she murmurs, cupping my cheek with her free hand, "Let go. I've got you." She pulls me
closer, and we both turn our heads to look at the ceiling for any sign of life in sight; it seems as
if we are looking through a huge window that is so low we have no idea where they live or how far
off Hogwarts grounds lead. The sky has darkened considerably since last night's incident, but there
aren't many clouds present on the horizon tonight either – not even the light from the sun shining
out over the windows was enough illumination right now! At least four students were taken away by
Bellatrix and the Headmistress had to call an urgent meeting before heading back into Gryffindor
Tower tomorrow afternoon. Chapter 28: What To Do About Hermione's Story Summary Notes:- A/N - Well,
here it goes. Just another chapter update... (See the end notes after the break.) Chapter Text “I
know what happened.” Harry grins against his chest. He is relieved that his father hasnt told him
about this yet because he knows that means he won' get answers soon. ‘But why would it be? Was it
something Malfoy did to her when they first started together? Or…he could have been protecting her
during their time together. It would have made sense given what Draco and Severus knew,’ says Ron
Weasley who hates to admit it. Hermione nods. Her heart races. She hates this place, feels so bad
for the people who have lost her and she can't shake that feeling anymore — "I told you I'd come,"
Ron says as he approaches a settee of tall trees, pointing at one of them in particular with his
wand out; "And then I realized we're not going to be able go back there any time soon." Ron looks
around confused. "That's why I was scared—" Harry starts when they reach a small pond about half an
hour after Hermione started. He makes eye contact with Draco, but doesn’t look up from where he is
looking at her. “Did you hear what I said?” ‘He knows how dangerous it must still been!‡ †And
everyone here agrees on your theory—the worst thing happened…in fact Voldemort killed most if
Notices are made by the Ministry officials themselves. That's just stupid! Now don' think Dumbledore
was right all along because he saw something like this, Weasley. And Albus has spent some time
trying-to get us involved in these matters since before our fifth year, Malfoy!" "Don" Fred adds.
Harry holds out his hand again nervously while Ron rolls his eyes: "Maybe someone had hoped…."
"Malfoy won't say anything more than that now, will he?" Ron asks, looking between them, confused,
and Neville keeps doing the same. Ginny smiles too. "Come on, I'm tired of you being so harsh."
Hermione says to Neville and Harry, Ron and Remus as they all take a break from their work day to go
home for the holidays. PLEASE REVIEW Chapter 16: The Search For Truth Part 1 Summary: Prompt-
"Hermione, there is no way in hell we're going back with your mum's baby!" Dean comments as he walks
over to his daughter who is playing with her toy dog that she has been keeping near by every night
since it was first born. July 25 th 1992 It has now become clear that both Sirius Black (who didn't
want to be named Albus Dumbledore because if anyone had known about this then what would have
happened? He'd probably killed them right off)and Blaise Zabini are engaged in an argument at the
Weasley's while yelling out names which causes Molly & Daphne Greengrass talking through each other
like they aren’t real friends after hearing how pretty but not really family! Meanwhile, James
Potter and Lily Potter walk into Fred/Ginny Manor shouting words just above Christmas Tree where
everyone can hear something horrible coming down around Snape's house when three teenagers arrive
screaming stories against the walls; causing people to yell wildly everywhere except upstairs stairs
leading up to the fire. One of the teens yells “STOP IT CURSE! ANIMAL WEDDING! AND THEY HAVE TO GO
HOME!!" “THREE BLOODSHOT!!” Draco shouted. Hermione threw herself onto the bed, running to her
father and wiping tears from his eyes as she fought against him with all of them: fists clenched
tightly around each other's wrists; head tilted back so that he was lying on top in front for a
moment. ‘Draco?’ She whispered into Ron who stood beside Harry again at this point just outside
their bedroom door - not really sure why they needed help or what exactly happened but it was hard
enough to make out where some things were going wrong before someone else found them. And now, after
nearly three months of trying everything, both of which were impossible without magic (which had
worked perfectly fine since there hadn't been any serious injuries), she was finally able put
together a plan. So much for being stupid about it. But still...she would try anyway… Maybe if they
didn- He saw her move closer to Malfoy and pull away slightly when he noticed something in between
her legs that made him flinch. It almost made her turn towards him, because even though he wasnt
completely sure whether he should stop her, he couldn' t stop himself from turning toward her right
then under Snape. When she felt something tugging at the edge somewhere behind Severus', "What?" Her
heart skipped a beat faster than normal and she could feel cold sweat run down her face. Forcing
herself to focus on one thing, she held her breath as he leaned down and nuzzled the back of his
neck with a soft whimper that caused Hermione's heart rate (and chest) in turn at speed all but soar
higher than normal into orbit around him so quickly it was like lightning itself took over their
senses again for good measure. “That’s it baby girl, I can feel you against me now!” He smiled and
pressed his lips to hers, moving them up along Draco through each half inch and then smoothing off
once they were free from Lucius' grasp. ‘You just relax enough already my love, we have plenty here
for anyone.  She nodded and rested her head on Ron while listening intently in awe. The sounds had
gone on for several minutes before finally coming back to full volume. He continued kissing her
roughly until every last drop spilled out onto Malfoy hairline whereupon Voldemort lifted himself
above her body and placed Severus underfoot before he parted his way across Snape who began licking
Harry. As he began slowly parting them both went still and silent for some time before looking up at
Dumbledore silently telling everyone to get dressed or else they would find themselves in Azkaban
waiting. A few moments later Moody appeared and gave an order leaving them alone. Hermione watched
him leave quietly thinking about everything which happened during this night and how much she wished
she could stay put knowing that when it came morning she would be able tell if she was doing
something wrong and call in sick. So, after a bit of a rough night, she decided to take a break from
her daily routine so as not for the long term anxiety she felt while having two weeks left with Theo
is putting on right now; she doesn't think she'll wake up soon enough at all because she's busy. "So
what about Draco?" Hermione asks worriedly looking down into his eyes before giving him a small
smile which causes his cheeks pink. He smiles back happily again once more causing her heart rate
spikes to increase slightly every time he looks over at her. When they're both done talking,
Hermione walks out of here where she finds Draco sitting there pacing lazily behind the desk holding
the top drawer open. It seems like forever since anyone else has been this way around but hers,
Harry or Neville have always been quiet and are quite curious by her presence. She wonders how much
longer until then everything will be alright. May 19 th 1994 After an hour-and minute wait Hermione
finally arrives home just outside Diagon Alley. Walking through crowds of people makes it easier
than ever for her to find anything exciting going on inside Hogwarts, even though being here today
means she has no choice but stay indoors instead (because one of those days isn’t tomorrow). As
usual, things are still rather strange between the three of them who have managed mostly staying
overnight during their stay together. For instance, most classes were focused on the fact that he
wasn’t supposed to be in a relationship with her, but I had an idea of what was going through his
mind if we went out and did some kind thing like this last week. He didn't want me doing anything
too intimate or unplanned so I thought maybe I could do something more personal while we were there.
“Are you ready?” she asked me when they walked into Hogsmeade. I raised my eyebrows at him for a
moment before looking up at them both where it took all our focus not even trying hard enough being
able look away from them. She turned around and gave us a withering glare as she passed by my desk.
After staring down at each other for another minute, I let my anger leave and just nodded excitedly
towards Hermione who continued following after her. When she looked back over her shoulder again
which was still far away enough to not get caught unintentionally touching herself, Ron noticed how
quickly she moved against Harry's side. The way Ron was smacking himself repeatedly across the head
made him chuckle loudly. It wouldn' have mattered much anyway; now that I was home, nothing would
happen to me either. Besides everyone here seemed pretty pissed off about the incident between Harry
Potter (and possibly Hermione) and Draco Malfoy that happened right under your nose yesterday. At
least then I might be allowed proper privacy next time since I haven- I don 'til tomorrow

## Chapter 2

"Shh," she murmurs, cupping my cheek with her free hand, "Let go. I've got you." She says and the
spell is broken as she does, but it doesn't take long to clear away the debris on both of their
faces before they're flying off into space where it's only about a minute later when our eyes meet
and we realise that neither are injured. We can see nothing in them from what we could tell; like
the way they look or the slight pungent scent emanating from between them. With a sigh, she closes
her eyes for an instant so that she isn’t blinded by darkness. A moment after that Hermione pulls me
up against the wall and begins pulling me close, resting onto him. When he lets go once more she
wraps her arms around his neck as if wrapping her legs around himself and kisses him deeply until
their lips touch each other passionately again while gently rocking back over the edge. “What…?” Her
voice suddenly breaks out at half speed because she's sobbing hard now and tears welled themselves
down inside of her tightly pressing flat against Harry's chest. He holds her tighter then there was
ever been since Draco pulled us together just last year (she thought maybe this was why), not
surprising anyone who knew him better than Draco did either. In fact, even though they know how hard
he must be going, none have asked any questions besides, ‘Hermione….‐ What do I say” “We have to
leave now,’ the blonde said slowly. Hermione gave him a sad smile and followed after her. There was
an old man with dark curly hair who had been sitting on one of his large leather chairs watching
them go. His voice spoke volumes in that particular room. He was looking at Harry; he was holding
something heavy around him as if it were carrying weight. ‘I can‘t tell you what I think! It would
be easier if we all took our time. But…we need this, right? You two will be more than happy for
tonight, when they  are alone.  ‡Ron! What happened? Where did he get these robes? The Minister
needs them soon. We need them fast enough!‪ Harry and Ron stood up quickly. Ron shook his head, his
eyes narrowing slightly before turning to look at Draco again: pale blue eyes sparkling in their
depths and smiling. They both looked at each other intensely, clearly shocked. Harry stared back at
Malfoy, taking a deep breath and then saying quietly 'Just stop talking about it. Just listen.'
Hermione turned to face Draco: she was trying not to cry because she knew how much pain she would
feel coming from this new realization. She wanted desperately but could also see he didn't
understand how she felt - just seeing her like this wasn...well maybe different. So she tried too
hard to find any sort of control over her actions, but Draco never gave her anything more than a
weak smile and an apologetic look. Hermione’s gaze fell on his hand again as he looked at the spot
where Bellatrix had fallen onto him before pulling away from them both for a moment with one last
kiss instead in place; that was when they finally left the room. Chapter 20: The Night is Coming
Notes: (See the end notes after the break.) Chapter Text "You really don't like me?" Lucius asked
Severus once they were out back in their dormitory rooms. He knew it wasn't fair to ask about their
relationship, especially since now that most people knew what happened between Snape's parents, and
that knowledge probably scared Draco quite badly; but if anything made them feel better or even
happier—and honestly, this was the only reason why Lucius was surprised to hear of Granger being in
love with Malfoy—it could be because someone has been trying all along not just yet… Lucius didnned
Greyback fur hoodie and slipped into bed wearing nothing but camisoles. “I suppose I am," Harry
breathed with a yawn. Voldemort rolled his eyes slightly. They had seen the way Potter shivered
under each other's touch during class and hadn taunted him further by doing so while silent. Harry
had told Ron and Ginny how much he wanted another chance to get some sleep without snogging Weasley,
which would have been a disaster. Now he was just jealous and wanted to get away from her. “Now
you’re going home. You should see what I got you for Christmas dinner, because it makes me feel
better about this whole mess of school things!” Hermione laughed darkly at his jealousy; she knew
how much Draco loved being the center point in all their drama—and now that they were together
again. She wondered if Ginny had mentioned something else about them lately or if Harry hadn't
noticed yet (because then everyone might know). She didnned both hats and knitted around one
shoulder, but Ginny snuggled closer so Severus could see everything: baby bump on top as well foot
tapping against mounds beneath him when Crookshanks came running toward Snape's chest with little
Teddy peeking out through its opening pajama bottoms rather than sticking out like an extension cord
from heaven itself... Or maybe Crooks wasn' scent-scented grandson anymore? There seemed only so
many possibilities before any person really said anything helpful enough even remotely funny once
Malfoy got there too early :) Notes :--I can't think straight right now, lol. Chapter 22:
Unforgivable Summary: Prompt: "Do your best not hurt anyone." —"You're my best friend!" Pairing:
Gryffindor/Potter Notes below: WARNINGS: Sexually explicit content, suggestive language & scenarios,
various levels played by the characters. She could be a smart witch/witch with no history of magic
or her parents, but she wasn’t crazy enough to think that Hermione was evil and had no magical
abilities – just that she was someone who needed some protection from outside forces for her own
good. “I don't believe it…but I do have a theory! It might work in my favour if you let me talk to
Tom about it now. But why? Why would he want to help us all on our way out? We must go back after
this! This is dangerous stuff!" "If we leave without him at first, there will always remain one more
person inside," Harry said firmly as he sat down across his lap, brushing his hair behind himself,
thinking. He looked up into Draco's eyes, expecting another threat, like a predator stalking towards
him, waiting patiently. As he did so though Potter shook his head. "We can wait until they know what
happened before deciding how we should act." "That's not going well either," Ron muttered. They
weren' planning on making their exit tonight anyway; even Malfoy hadn...well, didnn'. The Dark Lord
seemed determinedly focused on keeping both his followers and potential allies safe while also
protecting those within his inner circle. With that being said - once things were clear - he would
need them to stay away from Draco and Hermione. There was too much pressure over the upcoming
weekend already. Harry and Ron were still trying to find a way out of it, but Draco was determined
that they could all continue their lives without fear or anxiety for either child’s sake—and if it
weren't enough then they would be stuck with them forever in Azkaban. "But," Hermione began as she
watched him walk away, “it‘s not like we can leave now. This is why I want you here; we need time
alone and I donned my Hogwarts uniform just so you can face everything after this." He grinned and
pulled her close, wrapping his arms around hers as he kissed down where her head rested on top
before placing kisses on each cheek. When Severus caught his eye again from across Snape's shoulder
there had been a small tic at first because he had always wanted one more person there than Lucius
Malfoy when things had started going bad. But quickly realizing what Snape looked forward most days,
who else needed such protection from anyone? It made sense, considering what happened between these
two, that Severus didnt mind the fact that Luna Lovegood might have gotten hurt by being separated
from Narcissa during those difficult months. On the contrary…when she had looked up from under
James' glasses to see someone crying, both eyes dropped to Lily Potter standing next to Ginny
Weasley looking horrified. Severus had come home tired soon afterwards and nearly tripped himself
once Molly came back upstairs late last night. The boy didn't even have the blood on him, so I think
he's just been crying." Hermione shrugged. "That's not uncommon for such a young man to be so
obsessed with his godson that it can make you wonder if he was also a victim of whatever magical
malady he had in mind," she said as they walked down the hall from their respective rooms and into
another room. She sighed deeply, feeling bad for her friend. This girl was definitely a monster, but
how did she know about dark magic? She really shouldn’t let this happen to her... "Harry?" He asked,
looking at them both curiously. Ron looked up sharply. “What are your plans for today then mate?!"
Harry asked. His gaze was fastening onto Draco before turning away again; he turned around once more
when Hermione reached out towards Potter who sat beside him. When Harry returned the gesture gave
them an odd look—but still seemed unsure what to do. He took one step forward, and got himself under
control, only getting lost inside Draco's thoughts longer than she could have imagined. Even though
Harry didn-they thought he might be a little… uncomfortable like he often is now. She continued to
stare at herself blankly, wondering why someone would question her assumptions completely. Finally
closing her eyes, she shook her head slightly, putting aside all those thoughts. 'Well, maybe we
should get some sleep.' It was something Ron talked about

## Chapter 3

"Shh," she murmurs, cupping my cheek with her free hand, "Let go. I've got you." She says and we
both pull apart into a kiss as she places our lips together, causing us to exchange looks of shock
as the pain in mine makes me want something more than anything else that's happened over this long
time. Chapter 11: The Sound Of Silence Notes: Hello again!! This one of those times when I don't
know what is going on but it's so exciting! Thank you all for your continued support ❤︎ (See the end
quote for more notes.) Chapter Text Snow-Storm-Chap 7th August 2002 As they were leaving the castle
Hermione had headed straight upstairs; knowing how often Riddle would be there at any given moment
he didn’t mind seeing them out alone either. He seemed pleased by their absence from school though,
even if it meant having his family back where they belonged. When they arrived down the hall Malfoy
was still sitting across from her, looking concerned about what might happen next. “Hermione?” Harry
asked curiously, making sure not only did he have his parents home after all these years, but also
because now that he knew Draco was living with Remus, who was likely taking care off work soon.
Hermione nodded her head no, wanting nothing less than silence while they sat silently. She started
to notice that Ron was pacing up and down stairs leading toward him, asking questions or giving them
a purpose. And then she went straight into the office and started ripping open boxes of paperwork.
She made notes on her desk so that when they were done with their work it would be ready for anyone
to look at; but he was already sitting in his chair, reading from one book after another as if
concentrating all over himself instead—he could just barely stand it now..." He felt his jaw drop
slightly. "You're going out there and doing some research?" Her eyes flashed dangerously before
Draco knew what had caught his eye, Hermione's wand tip pointed directly at Severus Snape’s chest
where Lucius Malfoy lay unconscious. His heart leaped into its throat with shock, seeing this woman
standing next to someone who didn't want anything more than harm inflicted upon themselves by an
unscrupulous Ministry official like Granger alone: both men obviously very disgruntled about how
much money Minister Shacklebolt pocketed from every single student expelled during the last two
years - so many students whose parents had been thrown off-balance due only because Gryffindor won
outright. Hadnt any other witch ever claimed such enormous sums? “Do you have enough evidence yet?!
 How dare Ms Weasley! If I hadn' t gotten involved, it wouldn-' sesssto me nothin tha tiene behin ta
da wrong man! You see wit 'em nothin' left ou niggah bin aint no cause fo' her.” “But you know
better than that, Malfoy! I didn't give my mum an inch of your time in the kitchen!’ She bemoaned
indignantly and reached up to cup his face with both hands before hugging him tightly into place
behind closed doors as if she wanted everyone else inside so badly it was like trying not think
about what might happen next. Draco had never loved anyone more; he'd thought she just wasn—well
maybe Hermione wouldn... But when they were finally separated from each other after a long night at
work… It had been glorious having someone to talk to who hadn- ever wanted them back or lost their
love for one another. And all because Harry Potter could have won the war?  He'd fought Voldemort's
death and had survived for decades without losing his family name. Hermione cried again, this time
louder and louder than any word Ron spoke before coming down on top first thing Saturday morning
following breakfast break where Ginny Weasley stood beside Neville Longbottom. Even though some
people hated being the center stage in life but Ginny‘s presence made everything feel even more
intense. As she watched Healer Stroud  administer various forms such potion concoctions over several
hours later – which was why she felt every bit needed by those around herself: the woman sitting
across shoulder from Severus Snape would always bring out that boy‡s strong side, especially when
surrounded only strictly upon Narcissa Rosier - as if they’d been friends, and Tom did not care that
he  was the only one who cared. “What have you done to me?” she demanded, her voice breaking in fury
from her earlier outburst. He stood abruptly again, his arms flaring so wide around her waist that
her head tipped back slightly towards him with a loud smack on it! She looked away sharply at Tom
for several seconds before finally relenting. Her eyes were wide, but there wasn't any emotion left
behind except a rage and a flash of anger. It had been all too long since she had felt this way
about anyone other than herself. And now here he sat next Hermione Granger staring at her without
expression or words. In their separate quarters – very much like their own room – Professor
Merrythought had just said something she hadn- Not altogether out of nowhere; she sighed deeply,
closing her eyes and looking up into Malfoy's face. His gaze shifted upward slowly, leaving his
hands clasped around hers. Looking down gently, he gave an exaggerated wince. What is wrong? Did I
make myself look bad? Was I really seeing what I am doing? A faint blush crept to the corners deep
within his cheeks, causing his lips once more parted rapidly. Perhaps someone would call attention
by making such a statement.  Or perhaps they would feel pity for her? Or maybe they were trying
desperately hard enough because she wanted nothing more than to keep them safe. So instead of a
stern warning, Bellatrix stepped up to the bed and sat in her usual spot next to Hermione who was
still asleep. She pulled off some clothes so that she could sleep on her side, before leaning over
to rest her head against his chest with one hand clasping his arm. "Why didn't you say anything?"
Bellotix asked as she got dressed. The witch nodded and looked down at herself again. It was late
now but it was time for dinner. Hermione had made breakfast when she realised that Bello-Bella had
been eating too much while thinking about what had happened tonight; it made her slightly
uncomfortable. Maybe this wasn’t an isolated incident after all! "Well, I'm not sure how well we
would have figured out where my mother is or if we should even let you come back," said Draco Malfoy
from behind him looking over his shoulder at Bella's sleeping form above him doing her own cooking.
His eyes shot up towards the kitchen, and Hermione thought of every thing that he had done since
last night. There weren “what? You donve seen me go missing?!” No, no...but why did it feel like
such great pain just sitting there staring at their food? For both boys...and himself. And then
Malfoy leaned forward further into Ron holding his arms around Harry's waist. Bellini bit her lip
lightly making small sounds of frustration in the background that Hermione could never quite
decipher. She was too tired to even give Bellin one last look and they would be back on the same
train at some point, it seemed. "Don't tell me you're not sure about this." Bella scoffed pulling
out a book from under her pillow as she read the page aloud, eyes widening slightly when she
realised what Hermione had said. The image caused Hermione's attention span widen considerably
seeing as how the woman had been able so easily access to the library without getting herself killed
by them. It made Hermione laugh before quickly turning and walking over into their room, opening
both doors with the force exerted against each other, causing the two women just as confused but
then flustered. 'Mione...' "Hello?" Came another voice from behind the door. For someone who knew
better than most people; she couldn’t imagine why anyone wanted any help- or needed anything anyway!
Bellatrix stepped forward pushing away from where she stood staring up at Harry standing tall with
his hands clenched tightly around his crotch, mouth agape while he stared at Ron, clearly trying
hard enough for him otherwise there wasn ‘no offense'. “I understand. And I don…” Bellit took a deep
breath moving towards him once more looking between him sharply holding his gaze. He didn wouldn—she
hadn--but if she did let go she would sooner lose control rather than allow it. She took a deep
breath and pushed away from him, running her hands through his hair and down to get closer for more
leverage. He held her tighter until they were in the middle of nowhere near their destination so he
could pull out without causing too much pain for her or any damage she might cause. The tip shot up
onto its own accord and Hermione screamed as she felt it hit her skin hard enough that tears fell
freely on either side before falling into black pools beneath them all along with white-hot magic
coursing through every inch between hers which quickly dissipated within seconds, as if nothing had
happened at all. Her body jerked forward slightly but remained rooted to Malfoy's side just long
enough Draco started moving again, this time slowly, trying desperately not to let anything take
over her mind when she heard a shrill scream and felt the pulse racing around her left forearm. It
wasn't even the sound against Voldemort’s ear, but now was quite likely only the second part of what
seemed like an eternity of silence. Hermione forced herself to stay still; she knew that something
must have gone wrong because her heartbeat slowed significantly after each thrust and then gradually
stopped once more. Malfoy looked back at himself in disgust, looking utterly drained and exhausted
despite everything else happening inside doing so while shaking uncontrollably under both arms.
"What is going-" His voice trailed off abruptly leaving behind a huff of disbelief. This was the
last
