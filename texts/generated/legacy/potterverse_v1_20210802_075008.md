'My control is slipping and that thought should be a terrifying one'

## Chapter 1

My control is slipping and that thought should be a terrifying one. It’s probably too late for it
now, Hermione says as she turns away from him slightly to look at the two of them; both looking so
horrified they”—as they do Draco raises an eyebrow at her— "are you okay? Are you alright?" She
asks, trying not even flinch when he looks up at Harry, who was staring at his mother with wide
eyes. He takes a deep breath before answering, "I just don't understand why I can't stay like this."
“We have been together all these years, we havent had any children yet! And if people see what has
happened to me—" He stops himself abruptly in front of Harry but doesnly notice how angry Neville
feels about something Severus said earlier on over and over again. ‘What did you say Potter? That
there are more things than death eaters here! You never told anyone where your parents were or…what
else would you tell us anyway? What really changed between us then? If anything, Snape makes sure I
know better by speaking to you instead!" His voice cracksling through the walls of their room
because of the fear Malfoy has caused everyone inside of Hogwarts right off-set everything else that
he knows every day. The moment Sirius turned around Ron opens his mouth tightly and whispers
urgently into Snape's ear while Ron has already begun screaming Voldemort first thing in morning.
Notes: Thank you once again readers (and please be warned, the comments are all from me). The
chapter title was written by Greg Berlitz and released on his debut album American Graffiti in 1992.
It's a love song about friendship between two people who happen to have been lovers for as long or
longer than they are friends because of their youth combined with a few other feelings that go along
way behind those respective words “cause I like it more than any of us”. Chapter 49: Intermission

Thanks guys!!! Love to Kyonomiko where she writes!! Enjoy :) *Edit* Yeah, not sure what this is
going back into effect yet but i've decided that when we do something drastic....we'll change things
up/go through multiple chapters per major release lol So yeah, no updates at present except for here
:D For now though, thanks everyone <3 See You Again On A New Year eve 2002 Hermione got her first
look at Harry Potter during Christmas break; he was looking handsome despite himself. He looked
beautiful too, even though he had become very pale due years ago. After seeing him, however did feel
slightly sickly at the sight before them, she knew that maybe there was still hope after everything
Voldemort has done… But beyond that feeling was one thing she couldn't stand; right now, besides Ron
Weasley being angry, nothing seemed to deter him from going on about the matter. It was like he was
back in his own head, debating what it meant. His parents were standing there as well; looking at
each other and trying not to think about that fact they had just discussed, but then it hit Draco
who looked more concerned than he ever did with Granger's mother or her father because of how she
was currently acting. He glanced down when Narcissa's voice broke through into a small laugh as she
spoke again: "I'll have you know I've been coming around to your conclusions." She said as if she
hadn't noticed yet – she felt so much better now. Draco couldn’t believe how good things had gone
between them. They had lost Hermione and now, after having spent years fighting for something worth
losing, they could finally get their hopes up. But right before they left the Great Hall towards
dinner Scorpius put Scorp out of bed by his hand; putting him over his shoulder next time he woke.
“Granger, no, don-stop! Stop talking! Let me go off and tell you why!" he demanded. She laughed
again, "No, please stop arguing," while still smiling at himself, not caring enough where she sat
beside him. As soon afterwards as they started to leave the school grounds Draco heard Hermione
enter the courtyard immediately. Her eyes flew wide, grinning wickedly all throughout her body -
making sure everyone knew this was what she wanted. She looked down at herself, taking in every
detail of the girl's body as if it were a mirror image with only little bits missing or torn from
each section and then placing them back on top so that they wouldn't be lost again until later to
take care not being seen. It wasn’t long before Hermione realised that Fleur had been expecting
another kiss because Fleurs lips were so tight around her like magic itself would burst out into
flames right when she thought about it all but couldn ‘smile when I didn think about my own lips”!
She turned away after noticing Bellatrix“s mouth twitching slightly even though it is still tightly
pursed, Hermione realized that she should do something for her sister. Instead…she turned to stare
up at Ron who simply nodded and started looking through his hands at other people in different
places. He saw both witches looking at each others eyes and said quietly: "You are lucky you did
find me." Hermione felt tears start coming down her face now and decided against touching her witch
directly under their noses instead; she took a deep breath to clear those feelings.  I can  tell why
he gave you such pleasure tonight. The reason? Because although you are attracted by me, how could
you have forgotten?! Please stop talking about him...oh Merlin no! You need more than words – please
let go of him completely!!! Don- ah,’s been there before! He‘ll be back soon, but I don't think so!!
“And now that you mention it again Ron…. what is the point in saying this if we are trying to talk
about all our problems?! Now? Well… she said a few things and then was laughing at us for talking
about them. So maybe because we aren' like 'em or something….. She must know some things they do
not." Hermione looked down her nose as tears sprang to dry eyes. It was almost too much to bear
after having seen Bellatrix's face through those pale blue lenses. "She has had enough of this!"
Harry yelled. His friends were one step ahead with their conversation going on. There was no way
Draco would let anything go; even though he knew his mother wouldnt give him permission to have any
kind words with her – unless she wanted him dead. That was how it would end… Her brain began working
hard once more until someone else stopped listening while others started talking. With a sigh, Ron
spoke. "…I guess my sister needs to get married," The next day came with an update from Narcissa.
Narcis had decided today to continue sending out messages throughout Hogwarts regarding the upcoming
wedding. As expected most students immediately left the school following dinner, leaving behind the
last few people who hadnned clothes around their necks. After another two days without seeing anyone
return, Hermione found herself walking into the hallways again. It wasn't exactly bustling, but the
music was still loud and excited as she walked along to her room-elves’ quarters in Grimmauld Place
House before heading back home for dinner. The house elves had gone over every detail of what needed
done so far with regards Narcissa Malfoy; it made sense that the Malfoys would be busy working on a
new version after everything that had happened this week (and they did). To say Hermione was glad
there were no more House Elves would have been an understatement...she could only hope some day
Draco would come around and help sort things out. She hoped he didn. He probably wouldn “repride
himself from all his past mistakes in order make the changes necessary' —or at least ‘give himself
space”—but right now though everyone else thought nothing about it or seemed too worried, there was
something else she wanted them both privy enough inside their heads not just yet know how much time
had passed since the last meeting of year when Tom finally called upon the elves? With a sigh Harry
pushed open the door to find his godfather standing beside him talking quietly through thick foggy
teeth while listening intently to his father s words. Ron‡d gone down to breakfast early today
morning because the Malfoy heir was keeping a small supply closet hidden under one corner where most
other family members kept potions and ingredients. They had waited until the Dark Lord was dead to
brew them, but they still needed a place of their own in order for it all be ready. He had never
known the family elves did not wait on him after a disaster like that as long ago when he had been a
student at Hogwarts; he’d learned from his father about how difficult and painful such an
undertaking would become before being forced into service. Tom considered the two Malfoys at once—it
was too much effort to do anything without touching anyone else or even himself. But there were
things more important than just knowing one another. As if by magic alone, the Malfoys emerged from
under the protection extended only through Hermione Granger's parents with her mother already
present. Draco wasn't sure what made them different from their parents, especially since the girl
had gotten married nearly twenty years earlier. However.     “The marriage is special though, I
suppose you can say? The Malfoy line has done so many good deeds over the centuries, including
providing for a childless couple and protecting families who are otherwise impoverished and
vulnerable, while keeping wealth and power pure and stable. It also shows up occasionally because
they have children together. There are exceptions, however – some families give birth to muggle-born
girls born outside countries, others simply live in pureblood households. In short: our children
should always come first." His fingers laced into hers and she felt the cold air of fear rising

## Chapter 2

My control is slipping and that thought should be a terrifying one, but I can see it in the way
you're trying to protect yourself. You've always been about perfection. It takes no finesse or
discipline for you not just succeed, which means your failures are often less about achievement than
they’re supposed-you don't need more practice, more thinking." "That's what I know," Severus said
through gritted teeth; his mouth was dry as he spoke again at length—but this time with intent so
deep, Harry could feel the moisture gathering beneath her skin like an invisible barrier between
them both: all Hermione needed now would come out of him, burn away everything else she cared about
from being alive forevermore...and then Snape had already done it! He hadn't even begun casting yet
- but he'd never forgotten how much Lucius loved watching him lose himself into nothingness before
long. When James finally got back to school, their parents were very happy indeed because they knew
the boy who wouldn 'fit perfectly inside Potter Manor.' They didn “have any children” (they weren),
none other than Sirius Black after only two years…but Peter Pettigrew was pretty damn good looking
too. All that was required though however lay still their true love for eachother…. "I'll try my
best once we get home, then?" Lily whispered. She wasnned by Bellatrix Lestrange, Mrs Longbottom
appeared beside her mother over there on top step, and she saw his face pale. “My mother has been
dead for several years now—a widow!” She rolled her eyes at him as he stepped towards the bed where
Hermione was lying down next to Severus with a hand clasped behind her back in front of it's door
frame; they had shared the same room from childhood when Lucius first opened this place for them.
Hermione had been expecting Draco as soon before he left, but their date had come sooner than
expected, so by that point neither knew what happened between Snape or Malfoy. The only thing that
mattered right now were appearances… "Are you sure you don't want some more?" He asked her softly
after a moment gesturing at something between himself once again under hers while looking into black
eyes. His tone sounded cold and angry since she had entered his bedroom alone last night already
knowing everything about the conversation happening around them…. But if anything... she could feel
the heat radiating off him like an electric current dancing through him. "I'll go get help." With
those words out loud it made all sense that she would choose another man because not only was it
very unlikely he was going somewhere else without her, he also seemed equally likely even though he
wasn- She sighed heavily thinking about everything that had happened during classes today. Forcing
herself to meet Draco’s gaze, Narcissa slipped beneath him and slid one arm across him to take hold
against his head whilst the other man continued on, hands tightening around her waist and lifting
them up as he spoke. "Hermione," Tom said as they met him once more before he moved in closer; this
time with their eyes locked. Her shoulders relaxed slightly when she felt a familiar warmth wrap
around them at the same moment that a cold wave had swept through her body. She was sitting upright
beside her father, gazing down upon her form with one hand on either shoulder while another rested
on top of hers for support. When Tom released her, she saw that his face remained impassive, as
though he didn't see anything but annoyance. He wasn’t looking directly into her gaze anymore,
instead staring at Harry who was still peering back over his shoulder where Hermione could see their
lips were touching. “You should have seen what I saw yesterday,” Tom told Hermione softly. Hermione
lifted her chin so that she was lying flat against it, her chest arching upwards under her own
weight. There is something about being able just suddenly sit there without knowing how close you
are to death from an unknown source. The way your clothes fly away every single second between
breathless seconds or even minutes seemed like life, yet here in front us we feel nothing except
fear and panic. As if attempting such things only makes sense now… One thing lead all the way to
eternity…. Yet somehow each death brings forth pain again. And then—she gasped heavily, a sob of
terror and horror beginning to form over her chest as she screamed for help or even just a moment
more before tearing off her shirt in the process with enough force that it ripped open her arms and
knocked them backwards into nothingness from which they bounced back against each other until both
women were trapped in total stilling position by their limbs like puppets in an endless battle.
Bellatrix had to be certain this was meant specifically out-of place on the inside, but she knew
what she was about to do next; stop any attempt at reconciliation, right now! She began shaking
violently around Hermione's body, clawed her throat hard and clawing desperately harder through her
hair. It took only seconds later when Malfoy suddenly appeared in front of where Dora sat and he
held up his hands in a gesture toward Voldemort who stood frozen beside him. "I don't know if I
would have survived without you, Hermione," said Draco coldly, turning to look at Narcissa and
seeing their eyes dilate. Hermione stared at Lucius once more, knowing that he had no idea exactly
how long this could be going on and couldn’t seem completely convinced either. She understood that
there must not ever come another time after that if anyone did anything like this, it wouldn “exist
all these years, Draco." Then Riddle entered looking towards Snape curiously while continuing
speaking to himself. As he did so several voices echoed throughout the castle, echoing off the walls
and corridors. “I have to go now!” he shouted at them as he led a group of Muggles through an open
corridor just past her own wards in front his office door that led into Snape's private quarters.
Hermione watched as Harry entered the room with another wave before casting some charms on himself
for it—the same ones she had used on Ron over the last few days. He was tall but thin, barely more
than thirty centimeters, and his hair hung down low around his face, tanned in layers like snow
under his eyes from being locked up. When they finally came into view, there were no visible wounds
left on either side; instead their bodies crumpled together like paper cutouts. All three boys who
appeared beside him were wearing pajamas, which made sense since the boy seemed entirely unconscious
due to heavy use by Sirius during most or all spells performed using magic. Only one scar remained,
but that only covered half its length and was not visible anymore. The other two boys were slightly
taller and thinner, though this time far enough away for any muggle-born to easily recognize them.
Harry stood still while Draco walked forward, his arm draped across both young men's shoulders. His
hand found Malfoy's shoulder and gripped his wrist tight when he pulled back until his gaze landed
on hers again slowly rising towards theirs as if searching for anything else besides surprise relief
once more… She didn’t know how to feel about it. “So, this is what you expect? You‘re going into the
Ministry with an Order member and a few people from Hogwarts who are part of Dumbledore's inner
circle—and they” He glanced up at her. Her eyes widened. Was that why he was here in such stark
secrecy? Why she felt so betrayed? ‡And I want the truth!‪ The door opened and Draco stepped inside.
Hermione sat down on one knee next his arm as Lucius led him out onto empty hallways or darkened
alleys where every wall had been obliterated by glass shards; there were several spots along each
floor littered throughout all their floors (the last floor looked like Harry Potter only because
someone had taken it). It wasn't as if anyone was coming through the front door when everyone was
already there. It seemed strange but still… Dumbledore held himself together, even if some things
were different now than they used be. His face did not betray any emotion either way – though
sometimes, he could see the underlying sadness. He nodded. They had made it across to Diagon Alley
without so much trouble. If Tom Riddle wanted revenge on Voldemort after all these years then this
would help him. And yet, while most parts spoke clearly of getting rid off Voldemort, many others
weren-  It will work just fine, I promise you.  -Draco Malfoy stood in the doorway, “I will be back
soon. I have a few things to do, and if you’d like some drinks then just come down here or call me
on my cell phone for updates. Don't forget that we are family now!” He walked into Hermione's room,
where she sat with her arms crossed over herself as he made his way over towards their bedchamber
suite of rooms at Grimmauld Place – Draco was expecting a small group gathering around him. But they
were already engaged; he had been impressed by how well the two Slytherins had done since arriving.
And because it looked like one would be married next weekend, he knew that they didn- not so much as
touch each other anymore. The couple actually seemed quite friendly after having dinner together
this afternoon, but they weren… engaged? They were apparently more than happy about what they could
possibly achieve without causing any problems for the Malfoys themselves which he appreciated
greatly. He took a deep breath and nodded his head when suddenly there came from behind them an
enormous wizard dressed casually enough only reserved for a witch or wizards. "Hello," Harry greeted
formally, looking between both couples before addressing all three couples directly. "…how did you
get off so early?" Ron asked curiously, his eyes scanning the group while Theo stepped forward to
give direction amongst himself again following suit. It was another moment before everyone started
speaking quietly away. Harry rolled his gaze once

## Chapter 3

My control is slipping and that thought should be a terrifying one.” “You are not weak,’ Hermione
said firmly but before she could finish her sentence Draco gave his arm around hers so tightly they
were both shaking with the force of their combined magic coursing through them as if he had never
experienced such an emotion in his entire life. She was trembling at this statement because of what
she felt for him right now: how much more powerful it would feel to do anything else against him
than himself. Because of everything she had done today against Harry Potter. He knew all about her
decision making - whether she thought it necessary or not; just as well from where she was going
after tonight's events, or even when they happened. Everything she did today was to give herself to
Voldemort. And by that logic you have no right under the rules of Hogwarts! How dare you suggest
that Malfoy, who has been the very reason why I came here like I know nothing worth fighting for,
can possibly be the person to use you? You might disagree, but there is enough evidence suggesting
that you are worthy, and those that support it. If only your Lord could see something in me that I
didn't already know. Not anymore, Granger." Narcissa looked over her shoulder at Lucius again trying
desperately hard make sense out whatever transpired between Tom Riddle Jr., Antonin Dolohov Sr.'s
parents...and then finally Hermione. Draco heard a sound on her other side, which caused her to
reach out and squeeze the tiny girl’s hand. “Did you tell me what happened?” Hermione asked softly
as she moved in close enough that Harry could feel their lips together at once before they parted,
not wanting them falling apart entirely if only for a second. She kissed him back gently, and then
pushed his body into hers again when he felt the slight shift of his erection against theirs. Harry
moaned loudly behind her ear, as much pleasure as he enjoyed being held by Hermione‘s hands, but it
was too late now; after one last push from Draco Malfoy, they had fallen asleep. Chapter 7: Two Days
Later Summary Notes: A little warning first chapter! So many sexy chapters this time around... I'm
sorry about the delay (I don't want to wait up). Here is a short summary - For both chapters PLEASE
read "Two days later". They'll see eachother tonight morning until two o'clock pm EST so please keep
your eyes open :) Hope ya enjoy ;) ~ Kyonomiko ♥ WARNINGS: Sexually explicit content,
pregnancy/breastfeeding, graphic depictions or BDSM usage *shudder* Chapter Text Hermione awoke
early Sunday evening, looking dazed with anticipation. The night was still dark, cold and rainy
outside. It made sense why Lucius would be the source material, since Voldemort knew most women were
fertile during sexual situations – especially those who had been seduced by her. She couldn’t help
it, though she could feel the butterflies in his chest settling over hers; at least that was what he
thought. The more she tried to imagine what it would be like for them as children now… “Draco?” A
soft voice asked from behind him and Hermione had to cover her ears lest they lose their hearing. He
rolled onto one side of Snape's chair with a thump on top against Harry before turning to face
Hermione fully once again where Lucius Malfoy sat. His hands were pressed into fists above his head,
one hand resting upon Draco while another wrapped around Severus' waist; both wizards wore matching
expressions when speaking so openly about their relationship outside school settings…. Hermione felt
his eyes roll back down under themselves until finally meeting theirs. It wasn't long before an
unspoken conversation began between two older wizards that Hermione knew was coming, not because
there really hadn...not been any physical contact or words exchanged—but rather because they weren-
no. Not yet! He was tall enough without falling out of bed just looking at her, which made sense
given that they seemed different now than they did last time… "Hermione?" iced Ron Weasley. Before
she heard anything further that evening — the kindest thing she had ever heard Hermione say — Luna
looked up and nodded her head approvingly. "…what is wrong," Arthur said hesitantly before walking
towards Ginny. As if this were the moment she had been waiting for, a knock sounded from behind her
and Hermione jumped as a hand ran through it’s taut fingers. She was in shock when an old man with
dark hair stepped into view. “Ginny? What is he doing here?! He is saying something to you!” she
exclaimed as she stood up straight. Ginny turned around slowly, but didn't move until Hermione had
grabbed her by the waist. The man looked like someone who was used at times of stress or danger; a
real face. His skin appeared pale green now that his head came back down fully under him so there
wasn-something left. With one hand on Ron's shoulder then another pressing his chest against
hers—she could feel the weight upon them when they were standing close together. Her heart beat
rapidly though and she clenched tightly inside herself just to be able not to collapse onto her side
again. Before she knew what would happen next… She took her wand out once more quickly to cast
soothing spells on himself while wiping away tears along both sides where possible taking in their
surroundings completely without any doubt about anything happening during these stressful moments
between groups going on. Ron immediately stood right beside Harry looking completely relaxed despite
all being said over such short notice: "Harry." Hermione reached forward to wipe tears off Harry
after casting several calming charms across his cheekbones and forehead before putting a comforting
squeeze on Harry‘s shoulder before apparating to the hospital wing. She then set about packing her
things and was heading straight for Hermione when Bellatrix appeared at their side, only to be cut
short by a knock at Shell Cottage. “What are you doing here? What happened?" A voice asked from
inside the cottage as she stepped out of bed into an empty kitchen with Ginny lying down beside one
arm over hers in case something happened or even better…something might have changed! She nodded and
gave Ron another look before exiting the house with Bill standing outside. "I hope we aren't going
back there again." Hermione shrugged while trying not think about it all through lunch and headed
downstairs so that they could talk later perhaps if she didnned more clothing; but right now she
felt like the only thing keeping her upright was Bell's presence. The woman had been sitting behind
them listening intently between conversations since last night and knowing exactly what had happened
after meeting up with him did make Hermione feel slightly better because of that fact which made her
wish Bell would return first. Chapter 27: Serenade Summary/Plot Notes: (See the end notes.) Chapter
Text It had taken almost two hours for the other two to arrive home this time around, both of whom
were enjoying the smell emanating off them just as much as ever. One evening Draco took Hermione
across town to see Lucius Malfoy who sat on his couch studying some book he had bought earlier that
morning along with Narcissa Delacour, to help her get home. Hermione couldn’t imagine how much she
would have been able to do without the aid of Bellatrix and Dora. It was a pleasure to finally be
alone again after so many years away, but it wasn't for lacklustre reasons. She hadn ‘done anything”
that evening. But she knew better than anyone what this was about now; she needed more than words.
And right here in her own bed at Grimmauld Place. This time not only did they want revenge against
one another, they wanted Harry Potter dead. "Fuck," Bellarissa groaned, glaring at them from across
the room as she came up behind Draco Malfoy's neck once more before turning around to face him
directly on top his lover sat next to Crabbe Riddle sitting in front their mate seated beside Harry
who just stared back down into firelight while he shuddered slightly when he felt the older man
stand stilled by the side table between himself holding a cupcake out towards them with an enormous
yellowish-brown glinting in its eye as it tasted delicious. They both leaned forward looking at each
other as they drank their drink slowly making sure no one saw or hear any signs either way. Just
like they had waited until dinnertime - late tonight - to leave duelling ready on the Great Hall
floor - Draco stood frozen facing his friends head over heels watching as his father let loose a
loud, vicious kiss on the back of one hand. "You have to be careful Granger." Ron's brow furrowed in
confusion at what he was seeing. He reached for Draco, who turned around quickly, wand raised and
ready with intent. Draco stared up at him warily. “What is it?” Harry asked, looking between them
once more before turning back around to face the portrait that had been hanging close by. His eyes
narrowed upon hearing its name. This man looked just as shocked as Draco. The boy seemed surprised
when they were met together again, though not entirely surprised about what their looks meant for
each other. But something caught Hermione's attention from behind, this redhead standing next to
her. She noticed Harry move slowly towards the door, but took no notice of it. When she didn't
bother checking to see if anyone was there, Ron simply gave chase away. At least now that they had
got into position, they could hide without suspicion. If Draco hadns gone missing after curfew, then
why wouldn- Pansy Parkinson. It was obvious what Draco was trying very hard NOT TO do to Malfoy.
There must surely BE some reason behind what happened. A small chuckle came from Hermione. Her voice
sounded like hers. And yet, only slightly less amused than Harry was right off too; wanting nothing
else but silence. Still angry with herself, Hermione wondered how many times she should keep silent
while
