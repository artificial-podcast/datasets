'She didn’t lose time, but lowered her hands before her for leverage and thrust her'

## Chapter 1

She didn’t lose time, but lowered her hands before her for leverage and thrust her hips into the
air. She felt the force of his hips against hers as he continued to move in a slow circle around
them until she was kneeling on top again with Draco wrapped firmly between their bodies… His head
tipped back slightly from touching her neck and then it cleared at that moment that something had
happened. Hermione could feel herself moving slowly down towards him. Her body began rotating
upwards so quickly her vision blurred into nothingness. “Draco! Please, let me come inside you,” Ron
whispered against every inch where they met eyes; he was sure that if she were to look up above him
she would see a familiar image sitting in front of Snape's face: red hair flowing over one shoulder,
silver eyes closed, long blonde locks hanging in an elegant bow. There wasn't much else there when
Lucius entered her mind. The memory caught her attention immediately now – she thought briefly about
what he had done to Narcissa and how little control he currently possessed over himself. As she
looked up, watching this scene unfold through greyish-brown eyes instead saw light coming from
behind her. A flash away from each other, more intense than the first. It took several seconds after
that flashed momentarily enough not even Granger wanted any part or means involved in witnessing the
event to happen again – it seemed like the only thing left to do was witness it. Finally some sense
settled in her chest, making it clear that she really didn’t want to be around the other three.
“What do you mean?” Hermione asked with a small smile as they stood on opposite sides of one another
for a long moment before finally taking a step back and looking up at him through narrowed eyes
again over his spectacles while he stared out into space where there was no moonlight. She turned to
look at Harry and Ron who had walked towards them but were waiting patiently beside their friends.
For once neither knew what happened next, even though they all could see that he wasn't going
anywhere. It was still too early for anything, especially considering how much time had passed since
Draco's death and now that Harry just felt so much better about it than ever. Once more, she looked
down at herself. Her hair hung haphazardly around her shoulders as she fought against nerves of
holding onto whatever idea came between those two when faced enough to think properly about the
events that occurred after that night in Grimmauld Place. He had left Malfoy Manor without saying
goodbye or apologizing; leaving behind only vague instructions regarding Harry not being able use
magic due either circumstance or not having been present during Riddle manor several times this
year. The thought made the panic in both sets go away, and she remembered the day earlier if
something happened to her father… well… never mind everything else. In fact: it felt like he hadn't
spoken yet. But had to assume that was because of the way things were going between them at home, or
maybe they just hadn’t been expecting him. “I will be back in a couple hours,” Ginny told Hermione
after she was done with her cleaning and ready for bedding herself. She put her hand on Harry's
shoulder before it settled over his heart again as if trying not break him up. He held out hope that
whatever this did could work once more but it seemed unlikely given how much time passed by each
day. A bit worried about it was all too evident now that everyone else around Bellatrix who would
have seen what happened at their feet knew exactly what it meant. The woman left them alone in
silence until they finally reached Draco Malfoy sitting next door to Professor Flitwick, where
Blaise sat nervously in one corner, while Snape quietly walked into another waiting area near Daphne
Greengrass. It was only when Dora arrived from class earlier that Ron saw Draco walking towards them
and being pulled away so quickly - and then looked down at himself - that he realised something.
Something about having a friend—or at least an older version; a mate. For someone who seemed quite
young and generally thought himself to fall short due to his upbringing (even though neither of his
parents really believed him), it made sense. And there wasn' anything wrong with growing up knowing
you loved people differently than anyone else, especially your parents, but I didn't know that. But
it was a good thing they were gay, and maybe there was something in them." "Maybe," she replied with
an honest smile as he pulled her into his arms, kissing her warmly. He wrapped one arm around hers
tightly then the other slowly, before lifting her up onto him once more to hold her for several
minutes of stillness on either side until their bodies met again; this time Hermione felt weightless
and contented at the same time. "Oh God!" Ron exclaimed after taking off from Draco's lap and
heading toward Harry while Severus continued moving against himself. When the boy had gone down on
top despite being exposed naked, Snape brought the wet flesh to rest against both sides so no one
could see what was happening. After placing half-full lube over each cheekbone like normal boys did
(and doing so well because the entire room was already turned), which was another perk for
Severus—especially since he found it rather unnerving how quickly Lucius contracted when he came all
over his face—he got to work on getting rid altogether every inch clean. It took much longer than
usual just for him not touching his mouth or tongue during sex hours due billing for six months
worth outfitting each witch's body. She knew it wasn’t always possible without food, however: if
someone purposely ate too many meals by the end such things might become impossible under his
regime.. So, the next time I see you, please know that this is not something we have done in our
life.” “I understand, Mr Potter. You are my best friend. I am here to support you. If you need
anything, just call me. ~~~*~~*** As Draco left the hospital wing at 12 Grimmauld Place, he was met
with a quiet knock on Malfoy Manor door. The door swung open and Lucius slid inside, closing the
lock quickly. He wondered if Snape had been there as well; the room felt different from when they
first met, but he didn't regret leaving it behind for the moment either—he just hoped that the man
wasn's son or an old acquaintance of their own who hadn? Severus looked down at him curiously before
answering softly: "That seems like your father would be able," Hermione said quietly through her
tears over dinner (the woman had certainly had some knowledge about such matters). She smiled
politely, allowing herself one last look at them both while she waited patiently for Narcissa return
home. It didnt seem that long ago that anyone else had seen their daughter and had even approached
those she loved openly into romantic relationships. Now though…well, no one really wanted to talk
about her any longer than necessary. Just as everyone else in town had already begun moving out by
now after receiving word back from James Dumbledore regarding Ron Weasley-Black/Potter
situation...what could Lucius have possibly done to save me?” “The fact that he thinks you would do
anything for him is quite disturbing. Why would you think I didn't try? You’ve been through a lot,
Mr Malfoy!  He seemed torn between questioning Hermione and openly admitting his own sins. ‘I really
don; what if I‡d done nothing? If the Dark Lord was there, why hadn--why hadn't anyone told Draco
about it?!  But then again how could she ever tell him when things were going well? That was just
another way of thinking about them both - the very thing Narcissa wanted her husband (even though it
would probably never happen). And yet, somehow no one said anything except Harry Potter who stood by
with an annoyed expression on his face as the others walked away. Notes: A/N - Dear Readers, thank
everyone for taking your time to read this story! It was fun writing all of it from start till end.
Hopefully after my many, long years of being in the public eye, you will be able find some reading
material here where my voice can be heard most of the time :) Chapter Text Severus had fallen asleep
beside Granger while watching Hermione sleep. He found himself wishing for hours more before dawn,
but he knew he wouldn—wouldn—"that little girl know enough otherwise?" His brain drifted off into
thoughts at last."What does she say to us tonight?" Remus asks curious. "I don't know, I mean it's
not really anything like a muggle school lesson and you're sure that your mum wouldn’t be proud of
me for saying such things about her anyway." Sirius says with a frown. Hearing those words Hermione
looks up from where they were sitting on the couch and sees Ron looking nervous in front of him.
After exchanging an amused look Harry and Neville go back into their seats as neither one wants to
think what is going through Snape just sits down next to them. Once he finishes eating dinner his
stomach goes sour; something which causes most people around him because if anyone knew how much
pain someone would have gotten over being caught talking then everyone else probably knows too but
there are many reasons why Severus feels this way right now. Just when all other options seem lost
or gone Minerva walks out carrying her bag while standing by herself watching Hedwig take off
towards the common room. As soon as Bellatrix leaves Albus stands outside leaving both Gryffindor
and Hufflepuff students alone before heading straight downstairs taking Tonks first class so that
Poppy can prepare potions once more until after lunch time McGonagall arrives along side Professor
Flitwick who seems very pleased with himself causing Pettigrew no trouble. “MIONE!” Pettigs barked
angrily knocking Paddy unconscious onto the floor making Hermione fall backwards against a tree.
Sitting beside her Headmist

## Chapter 2

She didn’t lose time, but lowered her hands before her for leverage and thrust her hips even higher.
“Please, Miss Granger! Please let me do this. I want to feel you in my mouth as much of a pussy-
lover's punishment burns through your body like firecrackers from the 1800s." Her hand came up to
cup his face once more; he groaned and took a deep breath. "Hold on to that," she said after several
seconds passed with no sign indicating she was finished speaking or that Draco had been distracted
by what they were doing all along—and she'd forgotten about it when their lips touched. They
remained locked together, holding each other's gaze until finally Lucius released him so Hermione
could pull away and gently stroke Snape across both cheeks while Severus rubbed herself against
Malfoy who seemed oblivious at first glance considering everything just happened. She moaned loudly
into Fleur nuzzling under one breast and then back out again feeling desperately violated by how wet
she felt beneath them two fingers pressed against hers in slow motion making sure nothing went
wrong. When their tongues met another hot, slick tongue Bella managed only marginally better. It was
her fault because Severus had sucked every inch dry of Bellatrix whilst sending kisses all over
Harry Potter before shooting back into himself inside whatever witch lay within reach which made
things so tense between themselves not being able simply remain silent. And Merlin never knew if
love itself could hold such tenderness… Hermione closed her eyes slowly breathing heavily, turning
to face Harry. “I don’t know what” she whispered, trying not to look at him as he raised a dark brow
at the girl, ‘Severus Snape? What is that?‡ He asked nervously looking down at his daughter. She
opened her mouth but before she could respond he pulled back from them and walked over with it in
hand wrapping one arm around hers pulling her into an embrace kissing her passionately on top of
both breasts. Her lips parted slightly making Severus pull away grabbing her legs for support as she
watched him take his mistress by surprise, he grabbed her hips pushing himself up against their
bodies giving herself ample time letting her grip his cock hard enough to make sure they were alone
without being overheard. Hermione moaned loudly when he moved faster moving further towards her
entrance causing her body arching again pressing onto his length feeling wetting within her opening
almost spilling out past her knickers fingers touching the edge of Draco's trousers where he started
to kiss it gently softly sucking on it lightly rubbing his head between her clit making sure nothing
came undone like the previous night. He chuckled low slurred voice whispering words about how much
better this was going to feel getting close to home while still tasting so good smelling my cum
dripping off of her skin through her folds straining desperately needed release writhing inside me
needing more! His hands slid behind her knees holding her completely tight squeezing her tighter
until her lungs burned with the weight of his body. He knew what was coming and he continued to kiss
her back feeling the heat rising up from her core as he pulled away slowly letting out a moan, "I
love you." She felt him growl against hers again kissing at least twice more before she pushed
herself down on Draco's bed giving him an encouraging smile taking over her face looking into their
eyes while rubbing her head soothingly nuzzling them gently once they were done before leaning
forward placing kisses in front almost causing them both pain. It was about half past ten when he
came running after her one last time forcing himself inside for another kiss pushing off around
every inch that stopped him from reaching it. When he got home Hermione found her room empty staring
at the clock hung above the window reading five minutes till the moon had risen slightly under the
stars. The silence between them becoming even more intense watching each other watch Harry and Ron
stare upon eachother closely enough not allowing anyone to see how angry they are now knowing
exactly why these two had tried so hard to kill Remus Lupin-Black just days ago this morning leaving
behind only a small amount intact but still nothing being left untouched. As if by magic there
suddenly appeared at last light shining through the windows where some sort dark object sitting
right next door finally took shape breaking apart all the furniture standing beside it getting
caught wide open casting spells like fireballs exploding across the room illuminating most parts
within seconds too many to count. His stomach twisted painfully, heart skipping a beat before he
reached for her hand again and grabbed it from between his fingers but failed as she grasped it with
all of hers instead pulling him towards their shared room where they sat together. She stood on
tiptoes while speaking to Bellatrix who smiled warmly at them both. "Thank you," Hermione whispered,
squeezing his arm gently in return when one look back startled him from sleep so much that despite
what happened now was nothing more than relief. The silence lasted another few moments until they
settled into each other's arms and after doing so slowly turned away from Draco Malfoy once more,
standing up straight and facing the door behind Harry Potter himself lying awake against an open
window frame. He couldn't help smirking down at Ron’s arm as he came over to look around nervously.
“Why are you here? Why do you keep coming by my house every night like this?!” Ron asked softly
amused. Harry rolled his eyes slightly mischievously. Instead stepping forward to grab a chair next
only allowing Ginny sitting beside him, ‘I need your help, please!‘ ‡I don-‡ he said quickly before
grabbing hold tightly to Hermione trying not pull out even though she was already pinned beneath
him. Ron paled instantly knowing exactly why because clearly he knew how much pain he had just
caused Weasley right there under her shoulder pressing harder upon him. “Severus…” she breathed,
then turned away to look up at Severus again as he moved towards Hermione and the baby-faced girl.
Her eyes widened slightly when they met his, before moving back down into Harry's arms. She smiled
softly at him and looked behind her. He noticed that she was watching him closely and didn't move
until Severus finally spoke. A moment later someone else came in front of them and Severus felt a
wave rush through him, his heart pounding with anticipation. Harry started to cry out around them
but quickly stopped so only one person could hear him before he broke apart. "Shh", Lucius murmured.
His voice sounded weak and low coming from the other man who had just come by their side. For about
half an hour Snape waited quietly while everyone stared on silently in silence. Finally though it
was time for all four wizards together once more; after having been told that the three women were
being watched, for the first time ever Severus stood tall and faced the door of Slytherin House.
Once outside he glanced over his shoulder at Draco Malfoy whom sat in line next to Mr Potter and
said nothing as Severus sat down beside himself alone on two chairs. The only noise made now is if
Draco heard something or not. Turning his head carefully he walked across toward Professor
Merrythought where Pius Thicknesse stepped forward to stand near Neville Longbottom. As soon as
Snape got close enough Lupin's lips parted to reveal a row of black hair that was at least half his
own, and Draco could see the look in her eyes when she said it out loud: “I’m sorry, Severus—I don't
know what happened. I think you need some rest now…” ‘But why is he here?‡ Hermione asked quietly;
they were both starting back up again. She turned around, taking his hand, but he pushed away with
an impatient sigh before turning back towards them just in time for Harry Potter - who had appeared
on their side of him a moment ago--to stand behind Dumbledore himself so far down into darkness
without even looking at anyone else outside or being able help noticing where he stood. ‪Yes...I
understand,  he replied simply once he looked up. They sat there for several moments and then took
their leave. Chapter 28: The Battle Continues Notes: A little background information about this
chapter (and my own thoughts): This story is part two of TWO of our four-part series titled 'The
Tale Of Two Things'. You can find each other here! https://www.youtube_watch :) *grins* I'll be
seeing more people reading through these pages if I have any interest ;) Chapter Text December 25th,
2003 – Hogwarts Library Day 539 He opened the book he had been reading since entering the Great Hall
three hours earlier and watched silently as Professor Snape looked around at the students. Hermione
knew that she had missed seeing Draco Malfoy, but he was just looking at her with a sour expression
on his face. "Are you sure?" She asked him, trying to calm herself down enough for now; "I can't
believe I went into this alone." He said quietly in her ear before turning back to Harry who sighed.
When they got home from their class and followed them out of Gryffindor Tower Hermione felt like she
was drowning because she couldn’t have been more wrong about what she thought. The way Ron seemed so
much more open when talking to him made her feel cold. It wasn “just me! We had dinner together, we
were hanging out for an hour or so." Ron said with tears rolling down his cheeks as he stared over
his shoulder at where she stood. Before she could respond, it struck her how Severus came across
without any kind words or praise. Then something hit inside himself which pushed forward slightly
and sent his hair flying off the table. His hand shot up to cup her cheek and his eyes snapped up
toward hers. As she looked away, not knowing whether anything would be good for her after what
happened, there didn' come a moment until Potter's voice cut through whatever dark thoughts were
swirling within her mind; telling her that if she let him go then things might get worse… "Ron," she
whispered against Voldemort almost forcefully, shoving

## Chapter 3

She didn’t lose time, but lowered her hands before her for leverage and thrust her hips upward. “I
can take it all you want,” she said with a smile as Hermione‘s toes skimmed down the soft skin of
his thigh in record length—and then he was on top once more; pushing off to get some friction. She
knew how much he enjoyed that last stretch, so when Lucius took over Severus had done just fine
against him while Draco spread her cheeks for easy penetration at long range. And now her favorite
subject wasn't even here yet: Snape's crotch! A soft moan echoed from behind them like thunder
overhead, followed by muffled thumps below, echoing through every part thereof… That witch was going
straight into meltdown right there amidst these knickknacks... Chapter 18: What I Needed Summary :
Prompt: "What do we need? Something bigger?" Pairing: Harry Potter/Draco Malfoy Chapter Text In the
shadows ahead they stood watching their classmates exchange glances. Draco was leaning back slightly
considering what Luna was currently doing, as he continued speaking quietly. He couldn- Not really
feel sympathy coming from her other than knowing she'd found the culprit. The tension between both
men grew sharpening until only one thought remained left in mind: lust or lustless desire. They sat
silently staring at each others' faces for several minutes. It was not an easy conversation among
themselves if this were any case. Their eyes met as Theo gave the other a meaningful look and then
let go of her, making way for another door to open that led into Draco's bedroom upstairs—the one he
had been sitting in since they'd arrived at Grimmauld Place when she'd called him. It was still
partially hidden as it looked like there would be no more light inside this room until it became
clear that someone had entered from behind. Draco took off his shirt and buttoned up his shoes
before continuing down the hall toward their living area where Pansy sat with both Hannah Abbott on
opposite sides so far away they could practically see eachother. He held out two hands to make sure
she didn't have them. "It isn’t safe here," Daphne said, opening an envelope next to hers which read
“We” instead just passed by Blaise who waved his hand dismissively over towards Hermione while
trying not too much else to get close enough or knock back after being stopped several times due
time constraints. When she opened it herself Harry grabbed at Ginny who nodded slowly but firmly
acknowledging what Harry had told her about going through puberty. She pushed against him hard
holding onto Ginny tight squeezing her tightly pulling something small closer to her ear. Ginny
sighed softly looking around taking in the sight she saw staring at them all. They‘d never seen
anyone walk past either of these houses together without someone noticing how little difference they
made even though they were essentially locked together because if she had to, it would have been
better. The last thing she wanted was for them both getting caught up in the mess that is Hogwarts
right now and to be alone again. "Hermione," Hermione whispered against her chest as she stepped
over one of Draco's arms so he could reach out towards hers. She hadn't said anything about what
happened before and with a sigh from him when he gave her a small smile, Ginny seemed upset by their
absence. “I don’t know how much I can help you with this or we might not get along like usual,”
Ginny said. Her voice sounded a bit bitter at times but it didnned itself off just fine. Before long
there wasn- Harry walked into his quarters and Ron and Neville followed closely behind. He looked
around the room looking for any sign since Hermione had left and then came back only to find Ginny
standing on top of herself, her face hidden under something red velvet while waiting patiently.
Hermione turned away trying once more making sure that Ginny didn' see her standing beside Malfoy
where Weasley was sitting. It was probably best for Ginny if anyone saw her walking down to join
McGonagall after all. If he did notice Hermione, she would definitely go do something; however...he
wouldn…she kept telling herself that things weren—not going to work yet, but maybe soon enough! When
Ron finally got here, everyone was staring at each other and Hermione found herself smiling. "Thank
you," she said, her voice softening a little. She hadn't even been sure whether it meant anything,
but the way his eyes were looking at hers made that feel right in front of them now – even if he
didn’t realize yet. His lips quirked into an almost predatory smirk when they met with those who
hadn- never-ever- come before. “I think you're going to like it,” Ron said slowly as he reached down
for one hand on top so both Harry's hands could rest on either side him while Draco moved behind her
backside. Harry arched against their touch, pulling away from Malfoy without pause. Ron lowered
himself onto Ron's back again. They both looked up at their feet, wondering how long they had been
standing there. Suddenly feeling slightly embarrassed, Draco took off under the covers and stood
next to Harry until Ron shifted forward just enough not only for Ron; then went running towards
where they sat. He stayed close with Draco as they waited for the others around them arrive. When
Draco came out, he looked remarkably exhausted. It was hard knowing what would be expected of him
today, especially since he was still recovering from last night… well after everything. That was
probably why he wasnned out yesterday by Crabbe and Goyle. Notes: Next - The Dark Lord! Chapter 2
Summary: Prompt: 'How many Death Eaters do I have?' Ron asks curious and Hermione nods in agreement.
A few minutes later Hermione, Harry being a bit of an odd one is walking into the Hogwarts Common
room with some of their classmates who are sitting across from her as they all look at the same
thing that she's seen before just once or twice now. They sit up close together on the couch staring
at each other, "You were there." Hermione says to them as if it were ridiculous to say things like
that out loud but after what happened today morning; “I know you didn't get any sleep last night so
don’t worry about me going back upstairs tonight. It was worse than anything else we did over the
summer because everything went wrong between us." She explains telling them honestly knowing without
looking questions where exactly he ended up right this way; "But yeah, neither of us can believe how
lucky our best friend is for him to finally be able make himself come home" Hermione comments, not
wanting to sound too boastful by making sure no one notices why people would think differently when
seeing his face whenever anyone looks directly behind Sirius before leaving while still showing full
eyes even though Remus doesnned glasses wearing glasses which makes everyone around them giggle
again until Draco walks away hurrying off towards the end waiting for someone to arrive otherwise
hoping Snape will join forces with Albus instead Hermione heads down to her dormitory door pulling
out one file under two sheets holding four different potions ready to be put on them. Hermione took
the potion and placed it in her hand. She cast a warming spell over both of their bodies before she
took out some food and some water for each one, adding a bit more pressure as they prepared
themselves properly while I did so myself… Her body was starting hyperventilating once again with
all these new sensations that she had come across last night. "I need you," Harry said softly after
he left. He was sitting up now, looking completely drained and unwell. His head hung down at his
side, a single tear from catching onto his cheek when he saw Hermione Granger. The look Bellatrix
gave him made Draco's heart skip a beat. It felt good. There were times when there wasn't any
comfort or anything else but relief like this ever since she returned to Hogwarts. All because
someone told her to stop doing what they wanted to do. Forgoing everything about himself, he just
wanted that moment where he could finally show everyone how much love he really meant to Hermione by
letting go. Of all people who knew him, Hermione would have called herself lucky to see him
returning, or maybe even happy to find out things didn’t change between those two. Or maybe it would
just be a waste if the man behind Snape had been able to get away with lying to her every time she
asked him off? But none came close enough yet; no matter how many things happened together, she
always knew. He was beautiful, as were they ever meant to be—but he never wanted her so badly. And
if it wasn’t for Lucius and Draco.org, Hermione would have died the day after their wedding night in
September. They might not even recognize each other, but that didn't mean his image remained tainted
by lust or shame alone: Severus had been there when necessary since childhood with a touch of both
at play (his father's affection), whereas hers lacked all sparkle like honey from summer raindrops
layered atop an otherwise perfect dinner plate… well what else could one man need? But those two men
stood beside him without reservation any longer than required acknowledgment- At last Snape stepped
aside and took his place at Malfoy Manor table across three tables from Granger herself whom
appeared contentedly scribbling down a letter. Her cheeks flushed pink against every drop onyx skin
stretched over parchment where several faded papers sat untouched. She began writing again before
opening them carefully while glancing back up at Bellatrix who released another long sigh with
boredom which made me smile. “How are you doing today my dear lady?, I haven tread your mind! What
is this about sex kitten, do ya know something missing please? She seems awfully tired already. We
don n'lve seen her much anyway Muddy you can tell, so we‘ll just see what happens next week. Can” –
