## Chapter 1

Harry nodded. "Things are so dark. So dark. What would you do if you had that power? Would you find

love?" He shrugged, and she gasped at the look in his eyes before glancing to Ron once more as he

spoke again: “I…” She opened her mouth slightly, but when it finally closed, a look of shock came

over them both; fear etched upon their faces, almost like they were frightened for something awful.

Hermione stared at him with wide eyes until then panic overcame her body entirely - not just because

this was it or that her friends were protecting her – but also because Harry felt like he had been

crushed by an overwhelming force. Ron blinked, looking at Draco sternly as though he were being

caught off guard by what looked suspiciously similar emotion on his face. But there really wasn't

any way around these feelings. They all wanted Harry dead, he could see the blood seeping into

Malfoy's veins, soaking through his clothes. It was worse than the pain he felt himself feel right

now, where he couldn only watch and be controlled. And here, at such close proximity... He could

hear Harry mutter in worry amongst themselves, words that she didnt understand, his magic radiating

from underneath his skin and against hers. Just one night, perhaps two nights... No matter how much

time passed, no matter what she tried, nothing happened. His hands remained still while he listened

calmly beside herself as someone else stepped forward, pulling her closer. “Please?” Hermione asked,

pressing down harder upon her once more, pinning her tightly against him until his hand slid across

her throat again where deep purple pools had begun filling its depths after they had been restrained

away by Snape's black locks. He ran his fingers along her cheekbone and chest as if trying

desperately not to gag as she fought to regain control over what was happening. She felt like

something is breaking inside just now but never realized when it was Tom holding her tighter tight

while Lucius dragged her back up off Draco; slamming one knee beneath her shoulder hard enough so

his erection slipped past her earlobe causing gasps in response. His nails dug in into flesh several

times as though searching for some friction or pain relief yet found nothing. When he finally came

apart entirely, the kiss broke free from her mouth completely, only being interrupted slightly

because it occurred to Ginny why he had taken such great joy in doing so—it wasn't about her, it

would be about you. Not anymore. As he pulled himself together, he let out a breathless laugh

escaping all over her body: "No wonder I didn," she murmured as
