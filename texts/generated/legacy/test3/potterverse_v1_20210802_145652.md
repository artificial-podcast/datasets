"Good girl" he said. "You can do this for me, Hermione." She nodded and the door opened. Lucius went

to her bedside table where she had been taken into a satin bath with several lube covers. He slid

himself in and took out two of his favorite lingerie pieces. “Now you’re going over my best moves!”

Draco grinned at him while Severus watched from under Snape's blond brows as one hand moved up

slowly across Granger body until it found what was missing inside then slipped between them both

naked legs without hesitation or protest before releasing into another kiss that wasn't a response

but rather forced together passion punctuated by heavy breathing sounds coming from both hands.

Hermione looked down at herself again knowing exactly how beautiful Lucius really felt and when they

evening when they finally got together, but something about that night had changed them. They were

all nervous and anxious at once as they walked out into empty classrooms. It wasn't until Hermione

walked up behind Ginny who'd been standing there that Draco saw their surprise approach from

outside; Hermione smirked slightly as he grinned at her. He knew exactly what she'd meant. When they

crossed paths, they were already sharing a look. As Draco kissed his way over towards Lucius Malfoy

snickering softly, Harry looked back to see how much longer they could hold each other while talking

amongst themselves—for now! After several minutes passed between kisses where Ron stilled a few

seconds before he began moving forward, his eyes looking even wider than usual because he'd pushed

past Harry and Luna to follow him toward Sirius again instead right next door (which he hadn’t

realized). Just like that…. It had been six years since Snape felt comfortable with being called
