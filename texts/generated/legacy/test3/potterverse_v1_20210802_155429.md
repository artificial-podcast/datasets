## Chapter 1

“Oh, fuck speaking,” Bellatrix says. “Here’s how it is, pet. You can do this for me, Hermione.” She

says and that she does so much better than Draco had thought because he never used that word in his

head before her. Chapter 12: Telling the Truth Summary: Prompt: "You're not allowed to tell a lie."

— A character has to confess something without revealing their true selves Notes: (See the end of

the chapter for notes.) Chapter Text ‘We are brothers! We have nothing left… we just want you here

too. I am yours now. And...I love your cock; please touch my dick as long they keep touching each

other. Please show them what kind daddy needs most—a good little bugger who gives him lots more when

one wants to be touched by another than father loves. Oh, god oh thank Merlin God Lucius Malfoy did

everything right with Scorpius but Mother was only playing around from behind duelling. He would

call out if someone hurt or belittled any baby boy while he played with them. So even though Father

enjoyed having babies, at least there were some things which really didn't make anyone happy

anymore. Not all of them wanted children yet, after all - like Ron. But none cared about being a

mothering Muggleborn witch, especially those who weren't magical enough either. They gave up on the

idea when they realized why Dumbledore couldn’t have him dead. They figured it out and started to

believe that he had been a Death Eater, not an ordinary student. Harry had no idea how many people

there were at Hogwarts today; their first priority was finding what could be used as research

material in regards of Voldemort's past. Hermione and Ron continued with homework until Minerva

spoke up. “Professor McGonagall, I am here to speak for you because your daughter” she paused for

effect, her eyes flicking back to Draco before taking another seat next to Bellatrix who just stared

down between them all from where Dumbledore stood watching her with pure curiosity looking over at

his head almost challengingly now without her wand raised towards himself giving herself more space

than usual to do so even though she knew if anything happened to her then this would result nowhere

near as much damage as it would have otherwise. She gave one last look at Harry before turning away

leaving the room, walking into Snape‘s office instead going straight to Professor Slughorn  Office.

When she arrived Severus was sitting across from Pansy Parkinson who by the looks both women wore

matching expressions turned to frowning slightly but nodded slowly accepting the chair directly

behind her while trying very hard never once again hope being able go through all those years alone

staring at the death eater every time she saw him. Snape sighed heavily managing barely any movement

remaining allowing only one thing to happen: tear apart his most guarded secrets and become the man

he was meant for. “I’m sorry,” she whispered against him again as her fingers wrapped around Draco's

hair in a tight fist that clung tightly at their sides like an anchor from which it could never

return until after they had finally met Severus once more with complete trust restored by Lucius

himself alone on the night of their very first date. In spite this time being less than a week away,

Lucius kept his promise that he would always take care if anything happened between them so long

into any future visits and even longer if things went south when Hermione did not come home safely

or whenever he lost control of herself physically. Not tonight because he didn't want to leave

behind his own scars but also out of fear of what might happen next due diligence examinations

before going back to Hogwarts where there were no potions ingredients left. He had been thinking

about leaving Snape just then since returning home knowing that Lucius hadnt forgotten how much he

wanted nothing else except happiness for the day ahead. But something had caught his eye while he

walked through Potter Manor today and Malfoy was waiting patiently outside the window looking

through the tall windows letting out light inside the dark wooded walls where Voldemort stood

watching over Harry. The shadowed figure was staring down at Ron in terror lest anyone see who it

truly belonged now as he stared up at Dumbledore‘s son who appeared perfectly still holding the

portrait of Sirius Black underneath arm-in. “I’m not sure that” he began, his voice calm and

collected as he studied her profile, eyes flickering to Harry Potter with obvious appreciation

before nodding once. The boy shifted nervously on either side while Hermione walked towards him from

behind until she had reached his body at last; it was only then did Malfoy step forward as well in

greeting but instead gave a brief nod. She followed the young man into an empty classroom where they

were quieted down by several other people watching them curiously. When Hermione moved closer to

Draco however someone stepped aside looking for Draco, who was standing directly next Granger beside

Greyback, still staring intently out the window. Hermione stood straight up stepping back slightly

shaking her head placing a hand over one shoulder and following closely onto another, making their

way across some nearby shelves. After about half an hour or so Granger came around again reaching

out grabbing Draco‘s hands pulling him away when he started moving toward Fleur. His grip on her

tightened further growing stronger causing her breath hitched momentarily turning to gasps emitting

throughout the room. Once upon more they emerged through the door slamming shut sliding open

revealing a tall blonde witch sitting right above the younger students awaiting them. A deep sigh

rippled off her lips wrapping around Hermione as she lowered her arms offering her chest to grasp

the older woman  and whisper lowly softly parting her teeth gently slipping between hers. They lay

motionless together facing each

## Chapter 2

“Oh, fuck speaking,” Bellatrix says. “Here’s how it is, pet. You can do this for me, Hermione.”

Chapter 7: Part I Notes: So...I decided to give the chapter a final go because even though Harry and

Ron were pretty damn close they seemed like they had nowhere else left in their lives (the only real

change of scenery being that Ginny was back) so yeah, things are going well again now but there's

still more work we have to do with Bella now. A few last hurrah before we get out of here....stay

safe love! Chapter Text The door opened when the trio walked into Grimmauld Place. Draco emerged

from behind his portrait. He turned around and saw Lucius standing by one housemate on an adjacent

couch while another patted him on both cheeks. "Hello my sweet." Snape smiled warmly and tipped

Malfoy across her lap. Together he took off at random looking up at them. His face lit slightly and

she noticed he looked as if someone else was watching his back from somewhere deep inside himself;

something which made Severus smile. And then what? They all jumped together in surprise and Draco

grinned broadly. Yes - he did indeed look surprised. What would you expect us not expecting? When

Draco got down to business he asked, politely, "Do don't startle me" and he got overstressed with

excitement. She smirked at those red eyes who were watching him carefully. “We’ll see about that

later,” he said simply and the group made their way back to his chambers. When they were in Remus's

chamber Hermione summoned her wand from between her fingers before she cast a healing spell on

himself with small purple flames around it which slowly turned into white light as soon after coming

out of Snape hands; making Draco look even more terrified than usual. Even though she was still a

little nervous for him, Severus had told him not too long ago how much fear he would feel when faced

head-on with something like this – but right now she wanted nothing less than perfect comfort. As

she picked up her book from her bag, just as Remulus stood there glaring at him while waiting

patiently for her next move Harry felt his anger simmering inside of him and he sat down across from

him so completely Hermione could have her own copy left over by Voldemort without anyone noticing.

She had been looking forward today for two weeks and since then all doubts had vanished and she had

finally realized why Dumbledore had continued keeping secrets during almost every lesson ever since

Sirius hadn't died….it wasnt only because Dumbledore knew everything better than most people did or

understood what Professor McGonagall was doing! It was also due largelyto Snape knowing exactly

where everyone else was hiding… "Harry?" Remuses voice called again turning to face them. "I'm

here." Harry says, walking towards Remuse again. After a few seconds of silence the foursome

continue to walk down and Hermione walks over to her friend who is holding up a hand as they

approach Sirius, "I'm sorry I was late." She whispers to him, not understanding why he has called

off his stay at school for so long without telling anyone what happened before now. The next day

Snape opens another door with a book on it that looks like Minerva's desk in front too. "Severus,

you should be here soon enough; we're going to get this sorted out later than usual." He tells his

daughter, standing tall from behind an open cabinet which leads to a table full but empty of books

she can't see around other than by their large rounded hands. As if shocked Severus pulls one book

back into its place and starts pulling pages away until finally there are only three left. Not

having time to take them all seriously when both Professor Dumbledores arm rests over the boy's

shoulder and Albus' eyes widen widely once more while looking about even less familiar then ever had

himself. Once everyone finishes picking something quickly Pupils arrive downstairs where they find

Lily sitting alone staring at a piece of paper held in a closed bookcase across the room. Taking

note that every single page is missing just how many students have come forward after seeing

Pettigrew try killing Peter countless times since being captured last summer during an attack inside

Hogwarts almost completely because Voldemort couldn’t stop doing things differently, and it wasn't

just his past that had been a target for him. In fact… Draco was aware of what was happening, he

didn “do anything” to keep himself safe. He let out a deep breath, ‘Do nothing, Malfoy!  And then he

stepped back from the door behind Potter with determination in her eyes as she said something about

not letting him get away with any more of this than necessary. She closed her mouth and stared at

Harry who looked slightly apprehensive but nodded, giving Hermione an easy hug.  So you won  have

some time to do whatever?‡ Ron asked, before turning around to look at them both sharply once again;

 I think we should go see if there are any other plans on how I can handle this conversation.  ”Ron

gave him a sly look, which he nodded enthusiastically, thinking quickly through what had happened

while they were inside Potions Classroom. His hand came up towards hers, gripping her forearm

tightly as he pushed herself into place until his lips brushed against hers gently pulling their

mouths apart pressing together very hard. Her head fell back onto his shoulder trying desperately

putting pressure upon her core causing her body pain like all good things would eventually,

especially when she felt too close now wanting to bite down on his chest whilst feeling completely

helpless under his tongue or touch. Finally she turned over and leaned forward kissing him

passionately. When she

“Oh, fuck speaking,” Bellatrix says. “Here’s how it is, pet. You can do this for me, Hermione.” The

girl gives a small smile, and Bellatsla turns to face the blonde, ‘What? What are you doing here?–

She asks curious. They all nod in unison. Hermione walks over from her seat and sits on top of Bella

as she places both hands on either side so that they are touching. When she starts rubbing her

bottom finger slowly until there's a warmth inside her thigh when the brunette finally stops. She

looks at her sharply and frowns; ‡Bellatsss-. Your voice, your voice belongs only right here, with

everything I have to give back!‡ she whispers before letting go but not holding up any longer. The

sound gets louder now, more quickly and loud as if it has been months since those three words had

been spoken. Soon they all start to close their eyes again, which causes Bellitix who was silent

next take a deep breath and let it out immediately. As soon like that Bellithilda Black comes into

view, she shows her wide dark eyes, having no doubt about what happened between them. Even though

she isn't even sure why or where exactly whatever went wrong broke through suddenly appearing behind

her. There really wasn 'wrong' because every single thing could be seen clearly enough around her

features that makes Belliuse blush. "No, I'm not making you angry." "You're the best witch of your

age, and it's a shame our school has been so closed off for years," Hermione says as she walks over

to them all by herself in front of the fireplace where she is sitting on one arm and the other

resting on top underneath the mantle where they both stand awkwardly. She looks at the two of us and

then down at her daughter. “What do we have here?” Bellatrix asks confused. After taking some time

with her book, Hermione starts looking up into Bellahawk eyes. Hermione holds out her wand and

Bellaora leaps forward and shoots an arrow which hits right through Hermione who quickly recovers

from it before casting a spell that causes her sister flying backwards against the wall and landing

back across the room. Once again Hermione doesn't hesitate to fire but instead throws another one

towards Belloate while she aims her own at each woman in turn but misses only three. The second

volley of arrows miss because Bellarone just jumps away behind Hermione and attempts something else;

sending a second set without even knowing what it was aimed for. When she does nothing, which makes

the entire floor shake with laughter and curses on both sides are thrown together and left falling

like rocks onto the rug beside their beds. A few seconds later Hermione reaches under the covers and

grabs her hand, her hair tumbled about between hers and they pull apart. She finds herself staring

at the wall, her jaw clenching as she wonders if she's hallucinating. “I was just… I don't know how

long I’ve been in this room before we started seeing each other again...” The silence that follows

is heavy with broken promises of comfort. Her heart beats faster than it should when Hermione pulls

back from them to face him; a weight on top but not enough for her eyes or ears otherwise alerting

her once more who has appeared out front, their shoulders pressed together. He grabs hold after

grabbing hold of her wrists until he collapses atop his knees like Bellatrix had done moments ago.

His fingers travel across her neck until they reach deep into the pocket where Harry took her last

name. "What did you do?" "Hermione," Draco says, reaching up to cup her cheek. They meet one

another's eyes briefly and kiss for several seconds. The way their lips trail together makes her

feel faint. Harry takes a step forward, his hands gripping her shoulder tighter while both women

continue pulling away so completely neither can look straight ahead. Draco continues speaking

against her ear, "She was… she was hurt… There were too many things going through your mind." A tear

drops onto Hermione' cheek and then breaks free. It hurts because Draco doesn 'cause he knows all

these things without looking past them. And even though it pains her every time Ron watches him

struggle, and she wonders if he's suffering from something. She tells herself that this is the only

way to find out what happened…and then a very real fear comes over her when Harry cuts into her

front door after Hermione knocks at his bedroom window as they both are beginning their morning walk

around the house in search of some food. "Hermione!" Harry yells with a startled voice before

walking away once more so he can go straight home himself for breakfast. As soon as things start

getting better between them, Fred starts yelling about Snape being sick because all four Gryffindors

have been down there since last night due one reason why; Remus has gotten up early next to Poppy

who had told everyone not to eat until lunchtime (not eating was necessary) but right now Sirius,

Albus Dumbledore or Minerva just want dinner ready too! The first thing Augusta does while leaving

Bagman's office late on Saturday evening is ask Ginny where Bellatrix got off again thanks Gilly
