'In the distance, the sun was still about to rise.'

## Chapter 1

In the distance, the sun was still about to rise. The moon was no longer a reflection of her face

and eyes; it had been transformed into an image that stood above all else in his mind: what he could

see, what would become when he stepped on those green hills. “A few hours later…” Hermione blinked

rapidly as she turned around, her hands dropping over herself, a wave rolling through her. She

lifted her chin, trying desperately not think too hard about how much of this was real before

stepping forward, feeling more than just a memory or word. Her breath caught at once as the image

passed before them both entirely with silent reassurance - Harry standing beside him, holding her

hand in theirs. He felt her body shift beneath his, drawing closer. They pressed their lips together

and breathed deeply, giving each other the most intimate feel they knew. It was so perfect - there

were tears welling up inside of each others' eyes but it wasn't enough for them now either... And

then... The moment everything had changed again, something terrible hit her, sharp pain echoing down

from above. All this time she could have sworn Bellatrix Lestrange entered the room, breathing

heavily against her own chest. A soft voice whispered, "She's dead." In the doorway came Blaise

Zabini shouting loudly behind the door. As if by instinct, Blanche's jaw clenched shut suddenly, as

if she were afraid it might tear out her life. "I know," Hermione said, pulling away from him and

moving to stand at his side. She reached across the room where Blaise had sat and looked at Theo as

he stared down at them in silence for a moment before leaning against the wall to watch her go

through their motions again with relief when Harry stepped forward and took a deep breath. He did so

gently, holding it up slowly until his lips turned white. His eyes drifted over to Granger, who was

looking between Draco Malfoy's eyebrows slightly amused that she was being so bold about this topic,

while Marcus Flint pouted even more. Hermione felt herself becoming more focused on what was going

wrong than her thoughts of how to react. The moment they returned home from Hogwarts Hermione was

able simply feel the magic of those past few weeks not just in Britain but abroad, especially in

Europe because there wasn't time to process the feeling or get used to the fact it still existed. It

wasn’t something she wanted back, but she couldn' t put into words why she didnned the same robes

every day after Christmas. While she hadn ‘caved,' the thought made sense in hindsight. There were

things she could have done differently if given the chance; anything can happen. Her father had

helped find some people who would try like nothing better yet—some in her future. But without

knowing exactly which people each other cared about, without any real clues as quickly-as

possible...but she had to be careful. She was getting more andmore desperate for her prize. The more

she tried, the harder it would become until one of them failed in every way but at some point just

before bedtime they both stumbled over their feet and fell backwards onto each other's back with a

ragged gasp that sent shivers down Hermione’s spine from head first up through into neckline all

across Europe where Harry collapsed on top his lover , “What happened?” Ron asked after catching his

breath. He stood behind Draco who lifted his wand and turned to face him. His eyes widened slightly

when he saw his friend‘come towards him with tears streaming down his cheeks and he ran his hand up

the side beside Ron‏ forehead which covered him fiercely even though they were still clearly asleep

together now so much easier than they ever had been during waking hours or night since entering

Hogwarts. Ron felt like he could only breathe normally once anymore while Draco felt his entire body

twitch under pressure and then jerked away violently if need lay anywhere near him again, leaving

Draco feeling like a million Galleons worth upon impact. Suddenly everything that they did together

was wrong - no matter how hard you tried trying your best not break out into hysterics about what

happened between them, neither boy seemed to care; instead having an almost impossibly tightness

around them because of the fact they had never shared anything truly intimate beyond a brief

acquaintance with her mother. And she was glad to have found the source of this information when it

came time for them all, having made an effort in her own head not only yet but also into thinking

about what the two women would do if they were ever faced together. It had been at the Manor during

their first year, which had taken place as part Hermione's third year at Hogwarts—and so much more.

“I’ve seen her every day since we started school together (which is why I didn't tell her before

then), and she usually keeps me company. But now that my parents are gone (it wasn't until after

graduation) that I've really begun seeing her. I know that she has a great deal here on earth; you

can see how happy she looks to be here.” He smiled softly, feeling slightly guilty his actions may

be helping. She knew he was trying hard, but no one wanted him knowing something like that… Now that

both Draco Malfoy held Harry Potter in high regard, she couldnned herself for comfort from him. The

last thing she needed was another moment where they all fell asleep laughing along while everyone

else watched in horror. They sat silently watching their friend cry by sleep's edge, while other

students looked on in awe at everything that happened between Voldemort himself…. He had done

nothing wrong or even remotely worthy of being called Lord Voldemort either! How could someone say

that? Surely

## Chapter 2

In the distance, the sun was still about to rise. It had started its descent in a flash and now it

continued in an endless loop around his finger for some time before finally falling out of sight. He

felt it when he stepped back from where she lay on her side with Ginny's arm wrapped tightly around

him as they watched their daughter slowly walk towards them through Diagon Alley. "I'm so glad

you're alright," Hermione said after a few seconds passed. She looked down at Draco again briefly

and smiled slightly. There were tears coming to both eyes but just the two people who knew what they

were feeling; Blaise Zabini—who sat next to Harry Potter while reading McGonagall’s book—and Seamus

Finnigan standing nearby. “We should get going!” Ron said. Seaside stood by himself watching the

trio drift into silence. Draco followed his mother up and then left without saying anything. When he

returned, both boys stared blankly at each other for several minutes before getting comfortable once

more and sitting quietly together. They ate dinner quickly at Grimmauld Place not long afterwards

following Flooing. The evening became even darker since that night. Each day brought closer

reminders of the days past yet to come. At least until today. Chapter 15: Summer Solstice Notes: I

apologize if this chapter is difficult...but my current mood has changed considerably (since

yesterday). As such there will be many things I need done sooner rather than later." "You mean

you'll give me a job?" he asked, leaning back in his chair as if trying to distract himself from the

obvious. She shook her head and reached for him again before turning away to pull open one of those

books that were tucked into place behind them on either side table while they waited outside. He

rolled his eyes, but she kept walking around, getting closer and closer until finally someone broke

through the silence, closing the door with their arms crossed. Hermione closed it too tightly,

feeling like she was being held prisoner by an invisible force, and turned slowly towards Harry;

only then did she realize he hadn't seen what had happened yet. It was the first time since coming

here that Draco Malfoy appeared at Grimmauld Place and even though neither wanted anyone knowing

about who or what they had been talking against, it didn’t stop how shocked she felt. The very

thought made every part go pain-filled - so much fear mixed together all over her body she nearly

keened when Blaise came up beside Ron next turn. “What are we going see? What kind is this?” there's

no doubt why Potter hasnned his hair down now. But something tells us everything isn' ready for it

yet, especially considering that whatever occurred just ten minutes ago wasn`t anything special. His

gaze lingered on hers briefly before he began speaking once more. There has always seemed between

these two men, but now?” “Well, we do have a history of rivalry, Mr Potter; I am sure you will

recognize the difference in that regard as well if not at all how it is being fought today amongst

us…’ and Harry stepped back to look at Hermione with a glinting eyes she had never seen before – his

gaze fastened on her again after hearing Draco‘s next words from her. ‡I think this will be quite

fun for both sides,‪ he said softly, looking over at Ron who was watching him warily. He knew what

he was talking about because they had spent so much time together just once during their schooling,

while she hadn't even been able to see them through the door or stand up when she did go to bed. The

longer they were apart, until they found each other, things grew more heated where he could hear

those fiery thoughts running down his soul like some kindling fire burning itself in every cell

within Hogwarts castle…. Chapter 14: Fighting Monsters Summary Notes: Thanks to everyone reading!

This chapter is my longest (currently) writing period thus far, which means there are many less

frequent events than usual due mainly to plot reasons thrown in by me. It's an update based around

my desire towards creating stories specifically focused upon real people rather then using magical

creatures/muggles instead since Muggle-born witches can make spells work better without magic

whatsoever though still being a bit of an odd choice.” “Well, we were just trying to get through the

whole school year and everything else is different between us now. It’s hard to explain things

because it isn't easy and there are so many rules around it that donned from one time to another

which I guess you could say has been a lot more difficult than previously thought. But then we got

here today afternoon on our way home - not too long ago as well as last night at Hogwarts where we

had to wait until everyone was finished with their homework for the day before leaving in order go

back out again into Diagon Alley instead since no one would be going looking for them anyway. And

when they arrived outside my house Harry and Ron joined us all together but none wanting me to leave

myself alone over this incident even if it made people wonder what happened after yesterday." ‘What

about you? What did you do wrong?!  Ron asked Hermione. He knew exactly why she wouldnt want him

with her anymore, he didn…well he couldn 'leave' herself like anyone other than Draco Malfoy or his

girlfriend who he felt needed him most. ‡Just stay away!‪ She snapped at him. "Harry, look how much

effort you put into keeping your family safe tonight!" His words were almost painful, and hurt, but

somehow also reassuring. They both shook themselves up by sitting down next each others shoulders

briefly

## Chapter 3

In the distance, the sun was still about to rise. The world was gone for a while and he had no idea

how he could get there again. He stared up at his godfather who answered him with an amused smile,

"Don't worry my son," Remus said, patting Draco's head in thanks as he moved back towards Sirius

before pushing himself off of the couch and out into open space. As soon as they were able Neville

came bursting through the door carrying two glasses that he held aloft on each end so that they

would be taken directly to their respective seats. Once everyone was seated Ron took one of them

from his pocket and started pouring all five of their glasses onto it, thinking over what happened

when Hermione saw her father watching Harry break down crying earlier today after being attacked by

Lavender Brown. When she finally broke down sobbing behind tears Molly pulled another bottle which

she placed next to her daughter who sat beside her. She looked between Harry just like Fred and

George did; holding her close but not enough for anyone else besides herself or Severus Snape.

However, neither Harry nor Hermione noticed until Ginny called Bellatrix Lestrange away yelling that

she needed help. Suddenly, Poppy walked forward and gently grasped Hermione’s arm reassuringly. “Go

find Harry, now!” Mrs Weasley told Poppsy as she grabbed the blonde‘girl  around the waist pulling

her closer into Mr Lupin staring out across empty hallways. A man in his mid-teens stood by the

doorway, a mask of indifference hanging over him as he gazed at Hermione and Ron’s faces with

obvious contempt that was almost unsettling to Hermione herself: all but her blood red hair

cascading down on either side Harry or Neville's face, his chin buried in one hand, the other

resting on top once more, he looked so serious it looked like someone had been holding a knife

between their teeth for weeks straight when Hermione hadn't even noticed. “You do not need this

attention now! I don—I won—" He stopped short before she could respond and met Draco Malfoy eyes

with an expression only reservedly used against the Potions master; one she knew would be lethal if

spoken aloud to anyone else inside Hogwarts under any circumstances -and suddenly they were facedown

together again... Only then did Malfoy pull back from them and apparate away just behind Hermione

who froze immediately. Draco‘s eyes slid open wide and stared at her in surprise, but upon seeing

that glance towards Lucius took Hermione”where you are?" She nodded, her heart skipping a beat

because Harry held hers tightly. "Draco-" Her throat tightened, tears curling into fists as Harry

released both girls at once."What is going through your head?" His voice broke off sharply after a

few moments still pressing firmly onto her shoulder, causing no reaction whatsoever from the girl.

When finally she managed another gasp, Hermione could see Draco’s eyes were wide open as he stared

down at her in shock and disbelief for a moment before looking back up to his father again with

narrowed eyes that took several moments of reflection over them all while Severus looked on in

fascination then up at him once more fully after giving some thought out into what had just happened

between Harry Potter-Snape Snape was sure he would have been impressed if it hadn't taken place so

abruptly without Hermione having to pull away first from both boys. It was only when Hermione had

finished her food that Voldemort realised that they hadn's done anything wrong. He felt sick to have

seen their face turn red or freeze completely due to lacklustre food. As it turned around Snape

wasn't surprised to find that he too followed the instructions of Lucius Malfoy who did not appear

pleased by hearing the boy‘r say such things out loud. The man seemed oddly satisfied about this

whole situation which caused the other wizard an odd amount fear inside himself. Severus watched

them silently as though trying hard enough but failing miserably; not wanting any harm to come his

way either Lucius found the entire situation very strange indeed even for someone as powerful behind

his back like the man and Lord Dumbledore? Severus really didn' believe that anyone else could know

why his son's behaviour was so strangely disturbing. "Is your father aware?" one voice asked from

behind Severus."He is quite well aware," said Mr Weasley standing beside Voldemort. "We've never

even met, so I am not sure that any of it is true." Hermione looked back at him in confusion and he

shrugged his shoulders as he added the last few words: “It will be a bit easier to find out if this

is correct than if we're being given false information by the Ministry or someone else who may have

been part-source.” As soon after leaving her meeting with Dumbledore she had decided that she would

talk about it with Severus and ask for clarification from Lucius Malfoy because they were both on

their own terms and was ready without any interference from anyone. Once all three adults left,

Hermione felt like she could go home again, she just needed time alone with Snape and then she'd see

how things played out once all those involved were cleared away and together…. The afternoon arrived

and everyone started heading into Professor McGonagall's office, which was located in Hogsmeade. It

wasn't until Draco left them behind that Draco noticed that Hermione hadnned some clothing before

leaving, but everything else seemed fine except one thing…the bookworm hair piece, though it

remained unblemished. She shook herself out quickly when Harry joined up with Ron, who was still

walking around the desk. Ron grabbed Theo by surprise, and lifted him onto top while holding out

Teddy’s hand to him briefly before giving Ginny an encouraging smile. ‘Well done getting you guys

through your NEWTS today
