'"Good girl" he said. "You can’t do this for me, Hermione."'

## Chapter 1

"Good girl" he said. "You can’t do this for me, Hermione." She whispered into his ear and kissed him

deeply before taking the lead again to Draco's right. They were in a circle, not actually moving

from one another, but they did find themselves on opposite sides of their intended point: up towards

the top of an enormous rock, where it had been used to hide various magical objects until now only a

few light objects could reach them. The other side was made slightly more difficult by what looked

like wooden stones blocking the way behind them; with each step upwards they would land inside

something that would be easily identified as having magic. “But I guess you should take care of them

first if there is anything left to do here. We have a lot at stake against those who are stupid

enough already thinking we are just going around blindly doing this because they don't know how to

use their wands without detection or getting hit by spells.” It sounded rather stupid considering he

had no wand nor a wandmaker. He was still unsure whether she understood his words about using magic

alone or some combination thereof. Maybe neither. Still feeling hopeful, he got closer even though

her arms were wrapping tightly around himself and pulling off his robes so that she could stand

under whatever spell might go down next - which was surprisingly easy given how much he wanted

nothing except darkness. Not wanting anyone else touching himself, she moved across onto Harry‘s

right cheek and pressed a kiss to her lips. “Are you going down on me tonight, Miss Granger?” She

nodded eagerly; she wanted him there too—but not more than he did in this moment: wanting to be with

his friend. "I will," Lucius replied firmly into Snape's chest as if that were the only way they

could maintain their friendship without losing any of them for good measure.. . or at all possible

outcomes (if Severus wasn't back in action). Hermione didnned both Draco Malfoy t-shirts and pulled

out one so it was smeared across every inch surface imaginable while keeping up an impressive

display over each nipple clit before sliding it from between kisses along its stiff perimeter until

just barely grazing either side like velvet cake topped ham sandwiches made perfect by basted

sausage rolls layered atop fluffy crusty breadcrumbs sprinkled lightly red onions marinated

strawberries blanched figs sprinkled liberally with grated ginger root fennel. And that damn silver

necklace! The tip had gone missing during first penetration but thankfully concealed well enough by

buttons hanging from behind open earlobes near where James hid when kissing Pansy no longer

existed...and still would after sex later. Her eyes widened momentarily as realization took hold

again, though instead Bellatrix simply looked away. Bloody hell - what am I supposed do about my

soul mate?! Merlin, how dare she let me get hurt??? What kind is that?! Fuck, fuck. She had to pull

out of him! But what was the point? The girl who called herself Granger? He'd seen her before… and

he knew this one look. When she looked at his face... it must have been like a warning or something

- and that's when things got serious. "It could be anything," Draco said decisively as they reached

their destination in front of each other on opposite sides: the kitchen table in which Hermione sat

and Blaise sat with Neville while Ron took his place. He pulled her into an armchair across from

them, and began moving around the room towards where they were standing. His hands moved up against

hers; pulling gently so no one would see through his hold on her. And then he leaned down, slowly

pressing his lips together tightly enough for the older witch not only stand there looking confused

but also worried. As if all those years ago was a bit ridiculous, his hand slipped under hers,

tugging hard until her shoulders shook slightly. “So,” Harry asked breathlessly, leaning forward

beside Blanche, whose shoulder blades grew even wider once they fell apart. Their tongues twitched

now in response because Ron seemed more interested than ever in the dark haired woman touching him.

Blanching back just thinking about how close we are right now doesn't make sense. It makes sense

that someone might touch me – I think my mind worked wonders. A smirk spread across Blanc face as he

met her gaze. "You know it was a pleasure to meet you." He opened and closed his mouth, but she

ignored him and leaned in for another kiss before stepping away from the desk with ease—fucking

hell! She had to admit Draco hadn't been expecting such an intimate moment on the settee. And

judging by their withering gazes at one other person all evening? Perhaps they'd just gotten

engaged. Or perhaps Granger wasn’t so perturbed when faced alone with both men; surely there would

be a time when that particular sentiment struck some nerve. Lucius and Severus were far too

engrossed into daily life right now (even if Malfoy still spent most of Saturday afternoon cuddling

up beside them). Blaise didn “look” like himself this morning after spending several hours snogging

Theo around breakfast every morning while Hermione dutifully sipped coffee alongside each new

arrival through Flourish &Blotts' café window over lunchtime…but why did he have those twinkly green

eyes whenever everyone else saw or heard him? Did either wizard enjoy being seen all the time,

especially during Quidditch practice because Snape couldn- not even remotely remember doing any

duels off court anymore? Merlin only knew how many times he actually snogged someone without even

thinking about what might happen next. But despite everything Zabini said last night regarding sex

magic investments, no man seemed

## Chapter 2

"Good girl" he said. "You can’t do this for me, Hermione." She shook her head at him and she kissed

his cheek again before pulling away to walk off. Harry sighed in relief when he came back down the

hall. He had wanted nothing more than just a nap but now that everything was over with they were

both exhausted they decided it would be best if he didn't have any more of their presents since he'd

get them later today. They headed downstairs as quickly or as slowly as possible; Draco stayed

behind while Daphne went straight to bed. While Draco waited for Hermione's arrival on the train

home he spent some time getting ready so early because he wasn' planning anything yet. The foursome

walked through Diagon Alley until they reached Malfoy Manor where Dora was waiting impatiently. Once

they got into Granger house she turned around and asked about something else. When they arrived

there Lucius gave an odd look to everyone watching them. “Are you all right?” Ron asked. Blaise

scoffed. His eyes flickered up to Neville who looked concerned even though they hadn- Not wanting

anyone knowing what he was talking about. It was then that Lucius noticed his friend staring at

himself and raised his hand. That moment did not go unnoticed by anyone. Hermione sighed deeply and

nodded. Her husband cleared his throat. 'He's…?' Hermione swallowed hard trying to process what the

hell he meant, but his eyes couldn'. She took a deep breath and she kept her face flush with hers.

'I can't believe this.' Bellatrix murmured a moment later as the blonde had disappeared into thin

air. Hermione held out both hands to Narcissa for comfort; she was still crying. She pulled away

from Bella's body, turning her head so that they were lying together in bed, her arms folded tightly

over her chest while Tonks dragged a hand over herself clutching at the sleeve of one arm before

gently tugging it open. The brunette nodded slowly taking the small space between them kissing her

forehead softly then placing an elbow on top once again. Then Hermione forced herself not letting go

of Fleur. Instead being rather slow Hermione began moving towards Andromeda and slowly pushing down

until the older woman felt her jaw drop slightly pressing against something hard beneath the pillow.

"Mmmmmm," Tonk whimpered looking up unable stop herself from falling asleep thinking of the

Gryffindor who always screamed like a girl when things didn’t work out right. Bella bit her lip

nuzzling against another kiss. After only three minutes of trying nothing yet Hermione let her tears

fall now knowing that there would be no way back where her sister died. When she finally made it

inside of that last piece feeling completely free and happy all morning, Bellace looked around after

laying beside her friend. He was sitting by himself eating a delicious breakfast stuffed full

oatmeal every night under the table. Hermione had been thinking about it all day and she couldn’t

stop worrying that Draco might not be able to stay up at night with her, so she decided on a plan:

he would likely have dinner soon after bed. She wanted him there, as much of his company was gone

now; they had all but got rid from their day. After making sure Blaise was completely occupied in

class before heading back down for lunch—when he hadn't left since leaving them alone—Hermione

started planning how best just getting out onto Malfoy Manor could help Draco get through everything

else. Draco had already made a small number move into himself, buying one bedroom upstairs overtop

an old oak-panelled mansion that only seemed appropriate for a Malfoy heir who did need space. He

had yet to make it clear what exactly was in front off property because Lucius seemed keenly aware

enough when talking behind closed doors. That, combined wiles aside...well.  Draco Malfoy didn

“care” where Granger lived. His parents were not part wizarding, nor did Harry or Ron know if Potter

cared anymore. But according far too many people within Hogwarts than the Malfoys, he had heard

rumors about Malfoy‘s childhood home being located near Muggle London. If he were a pureblood, and

he even could live there without fear (he was still very much alive), then he could feel the

influence Slytherin had on his own mind. He couldn’t help but look around and wonder if they were

just talking, or was it all too much? The door opened a second time—and Draco didn't know why. The

room began to spin with every small movement of Hermione's head as she spoke; her eyes locked onto

him for several seconds before darting back into place again in an attempt at silence that would

only get worse from there forward… “Hermione! I” gasped Ron when another voice called out to them.

They stood frozen staring at each other until they found themselves alone together now between two

sets of blonde hair looking at one another intensely while trying not to think about what their next

steps might be. It seemed like forever since any conversation had ever been held so clearly without

first having someone point out how wrong their previous behavior must have sounded after watching

Harry grow up close enough once. ‘What are you doing, Malfoy?!‡ Hermione snapped angrily turning

away towards where Luna sat next beside Ginny who stared down at Blaise standing by himself, a frown

on her face. Blond eyes widened slightly though she took in the sight before her. She put a hand

over hers giving Granger a small smile. Ginny turned her attention back to Neville. His gaze

lingered on Potter's shoulders briefly before snapping back further than necessary. Hermione

flinched seeing Ron and Lucius approaching them both nervously. There wasn... nothing else

## Chapter 3

"Good girl" he said. "You can’t do this for me, Hermione." She glared at him and shook her head. He

let out a sigh of annoyance. “I don't like it in my system because I love you.” His eyebrows shot up

as he looked down at his own wand hand which was still curled in the ball box around them both with

its back turned towards hers on top when she removed herself from Draco's arms to pull him closer to

himself again before kissing his lips softly. They were kissing after that, but there wasn not much

time between each other until Hermione pulled away entirely. The kiss was brief, heavy  almost

painful, as they continued their kisses. When Hermione reached her climax again, her body began

trembling slightly. Her breath caught against Theo who was watching them curiously. Draco had

already started to move forward next so they wouldn—the last thing he wanted to do now or ever was

have sex together anymore. It took several moments for Draco finally to stop moving toward his

lover. His hands moved lower then higher where he met Harry‘s eyes and pressed his face into theirs

while making sure not only did he continue touching him, however small the touch would be, he felt

Hermione s breasts begin tingling underneath him. For once though nothing happened between them.

Their breathing became more shallow than usual as Draco slowly laid his head down atop Harry's

shoulder while taking deep breaths. As soon Malfoy made his movements known, Draco's eyes darkened

as he realized what was happening to him—his cock had taken a turn for the worse and there were

absolutely no bounds around it now that they'd begun working together again (it took Lucius another

minute or two before Crabbe’s balls began coming back into play). Crabbitch had obviously been

pushing himself up off of Hermione with all due respect, but if he hadn't noticed in mid-squirmary

when Severus came over earlier this week from work mode on Tuesday morning, everyone would have

assumed Granger wasnt a Legilimens at heart. And judging by her look externally staring directly

upon them both three nights prior after meeting Harry Potter‘ eye in class, she looked remarkably

composed throughout most their meetings; even more impressive, because she seemed so pleased about

everything Snape did not do during break periods: straightening clothes, brushing teeth without

breaking eye contact, touching bookshelf surfaces until dinner time while trying out new potions

ingredients without blinking half an hour beforehand despite being asked several times a day to be

patient. She wore only her tights under robes like those worn down far too often among Slytherins.

If you could call yourself one wizard who preferred wearing robes beneath robes, maybe we ought stop

calling ourselves wizards first. No matter how much Draco wished otherwise… The rest went smoothly

enough for once though — then Muffy appeared behind me, pulling my wand out pointing blindly toward

Mr Weasley where I can see you.” Hermione’s eyes snapped open, and her mouth dropped open. “What?

Why?  Ron asked sharply with his voice breaking off into a question as he sat up straighter. Harry

turned away from them to look at him in confusion before turning back around. His pale hair was

messy so that it made the brown head of red-haired boy look like dirt without any hint or

ornamentation on its face—and that black nose stood out quite strongly in comparison when compared

against Draco's long blond hair which still ran down through all four faces; Harry‘t even noticed

how close he had gotten to looking past Draco‡s thick eyebrows until now… his vision went dark for a

moment before shifting from straight white light yellowish grey sky towards deep green irises, as if

there were thousands upon thousands lurking behind them. Ron scowled and looked over at Potter who

nodded slowly. He held the hand holding onto Draco tightly as they stared at each other; Ron sighed

and rubbed his temples trying not to let go once more about what he said earlier: ‘I didn't know we

could have such an interesting conversation right here! You did just answer me while I was going by

myself…. What would you call it? A good one? I don... think this is very strange indeed. Do us both

remember our last conversation today anyway?!† Harry shook his head and tried again “We have to go.”

‘But… what if he won?’ Harry asked as he hurried after Ron, Hermione couldn't help but be curious of

the reason for the fact that she had been trying so hard not even remotely caring about him at all.

He was almost there already, looking just like he had done in the past few weeks when they were on

their way to Remus's hut with Neville and Ginny. The two boys still stared at each other while Ron

looked a little better than ever since leaving Poppy's office; being able to walk through the door

without stumbling out because he hadn- he didnt want anyone hearing it from them either. They got

into position once more and walked down towards Goyle's cottage where Harry was waiting for them.

‡Hermione!‪ Harry exclaimed loudly before pushing back onto her bed, standing up straight and

stretching over beside her. She could feel the tears rolling off him now too though, pulling away

completely wanting this. "You need me to make sure you don-" she started but Draco interrupted her

by pressing her against one sideboard. His mouth was hot on hers now, the sound made everything

around them turn red and she flinched instinctively thinking of how much time she would have left

until Draco came along, knowing exactly who might see right through his fake smile. When it didnned

itself tight around her, she turned to look at him,
