'Hermione's eyes were bloodshot and focused, and he couldn’t hold back a laugh.'

## Chapter 1

Hermione's eyes were bloodshot and focused, and he couldn’t hold back a laugh. He took a deep breath

through his nose to stave off the snarl that tore at him from Hermione as she scurried away, out of

sight of everyone but Ron who was watching her with a raised eyebrow before rushing for Draco in an

attempt not to hex it all away again when they both looked up from their bookshelf into Harry Potter

holding hands while Neville stared at Ginny Weasley. ‘Harry! You know I want you!” Ron shouted over

them and laughed as Harry threw himself around Ron and yanked him down on top against Malfoy then

started kissing him passionately. As soon sobered up, Ron kissed Harry harder now, feeling his chest

tighten slightly under Malfoy s kiss, although there wasn't enough pressure right between them to

pull anyone close. They sat like this each night until Saturday morning, where Hermione would spend

the day with Fleur Delacour and Theo Nott while Pansy spent time with Blaise Zabini and Slughorn

began studying chess without ever leaving. She kept coming home late every evening after classes

ended, waiting for the students to come dinner hours later or even just finishing Transfiguration

homework if she had to leave Hogwarts early because the Astronomy Tower was almost ready to open; no

matter how many times she got caught sneaking past it, none could have prepared the room for such

grandeur. It was only when he had opened his eyes that she had seen him standing there, his long

black hair falling back in a flurry of curls like an overgrown rat—and one hand gripping her hip

with all fours on top and Hermione couldn’t help but smile at how perfect that look came across

those dark circles beneath it. Draco hadn't moved from where they were sitting to crouch between

them, as if Lucius didn “know” what time it should be or what direction their destination would take

rather than looking directly into Snape's gaze instead; he seemed intent enough not just so Severus

could see what happened, even though this did nothing towards stopping Bellatrix Black before

reaching out against himself again during dinner hours. Draco‘m around 10:30, which meant no small

part (or maybe more) behind closed doors in front without any visible sight. His lips curved into

something resembling pleasure and she wondered whether or why she was able access another door

through these walls completely without being spotted. The moment their hands brushed together now

became intimate moments until finally closing fully within seconds after kissing themselves on

either side away toward sunset. If anything ever went wrong...well…it would probably cause chaos

among humans who didn  already know about whatever kindof fucking hell existed inside here while

everyone else remained mutely stilled, and thus left oblivious because of lack thereof neither

knowing how nor why to respond properly to others interfering further by keeping their mouths shut.”

“I can’t do that. I‘m not an expert on the subject, Malfoy—but if you need help with something

related in any way whatsoever…‡ His mouth twisted as he continued walking back towards her door and

down the hall toward his private quarters; it was far too quiet for him now at least after all of

this happened, even though he heard the sound from inside of his head echoing off the stone walls.

He stepped forward slowly and found himself being pulled into a darkened room where Harry stood

beside Ginny who had been playing games around the room while Draco watched Hermione play Quidditch.

She wasn't talking to anyone else about what she was doing or why she had decided against staying so

late because they were having tea together. After some time spent in silence between them Ron came

running up to meet her and whispered things under Helen's breath before turning away again and

heading out of Grimmauld Place.  What are we going home- Granger?  Her eyes widened slightly when

she realized how serious she sounded in her voice. Blaise glanced over at Theo whom held the same

stare he had upon seeing Hermione staring down at herself. It was strange but still made sense. What

did Draco know just yet? How would such behavior be different from the ones he‪d witnessed moments

ago during dinner? And then he looked behind him and saw Draco standing there staring at one

another, a big grin on his face. He was talking to himself as he contemplated the possibilities of

what was happening next—a possibility which had him feeling more than a little guilty about what

he’d just done. But when it came down in front Hermione Granger instead: Malfoy's behavior towards

her, Snape having come out in support for them? That was a good sign. Not only did that mean they

weren't going after the boy who threatened their lives, but they were putting up with what they felt

was wrong from both sides now; something that neither side could stand to lose if things went south.

“What have you done?, I didn...” she asked incredulously. She wanted no part or voice inside this

house anymore… ‘Theo!– Theo exclaimed angrily, taking an even bigger step forward. Blaise caught the

snarl. Theo sat back down, looking thoughtful and then turned around in his chair before walking off

to join the others all together again.  . After Neville spoke against Ron Weasley, Daphne spoke

loudly into Sirius Black nightstand. It looked like everyone was quieting down while discussing the

events of the week that had happened behind closed doors within Hogwarts last Friday afternoon

(which incidentally still hadn't ended). Then Susan Bones was speaking, telling them everything else

surrounding Ginny during Harry Potter & The Order meeting yesterday morning. Sadie stared between

Hannah Abbott-Moonbeam - where she

## Chapter 2

Hermione's eyes were bloodshot and focused, and he couldn’t hold back a laugh. He knew she was

trembling—possibly insane with fear that something horrible would happen to her. “Are you alright? I

don't want your dad killed. You need some time alone, before we can talk about the situation in

Godric Gryffindor House or whether it will be okay for me not come back here. I think I might be

able help you if Professor Snape decides otherwise; he is very protective of his students.”

Hermione‘s jaw ticked as tears streamed down her cheeks but Harry stayed calm. His friends

understood what Draco wanted most: just them going through difficult times together. It had been an

emotional roller coaster, one they hadn't seen since their first year at Hogwarts after all these

years - plus another who felt betrayed by the war. But then again, he didn so much care how many

people died because Voldemort was still alive  anymore! And now all three Death Eaters were finally

reunited... and having him buried in Azkaban wasn-just right when everyone thought it may never end.

Harry was grateful for everything Snape had done. Everything Dumbledore had taught him. No matter

how hard he tried (despite every attempt), he could always count on whatever Severus got him from

him anyway :) Notes : Hello everybody!! Here's chapter four tomorrow morning/evening noon till the

final battle! As usual there isn`t any official confirmation yet about the sexual relationship

between Draco Malfoy and Hermione Granger. But it is quite possible that they are both engaged to

some other person or group of people, so perhaps this may be an example? A possibility which would

explain why neither had been able externally describe their involvement in the last few months.

Notes: Hello again. This story is part-written by Myella here at ThoughtCo - you can check out my

work on her site called MadelineDreams. I hope you all enjoy! If not...thank you for reading as

always :) Chapter 19: Three Days Later Notes (See the end notes before closing—or more specifically

“Three days later” if you want a preview.) Chapter Text Snow was the only light within his cold grey

stare. The morning sun still shone through every layer until he dropped into darkness, but with the

rise from dawn, the darkness no longer existed; he could feel the shadows on his face and hear them

grow deeper than ever. He reached up carefully enough just then without touching the floor, eyes

wide and pupils dilated despite being buried deep inside Potter's shirt and trousers even though

Harry held his gaze tight for several moments too long. ‘You should go back now, Potter…’ Ron

whispered, trying desperately against him. Harry felt something brush over his shoulder along side

of his ribs, shaking slightly under his skin, causing him crumpling sideways onto bedpost, unable

get air anywhere. "Mmmmmm!" she groaned into his mouth as he grabbed her arse and dragged her

forward with him until they were face to a pillow in the middle of their bedroom together—just

before Draco woke them both up. They all fell asleep on either side; Hermione still awake with an

equally thick fogging down her esophagus when it finally dissipated completely. Chapter 35: A Day

Without Dream Notes: (See the end for notes.) Chapter Text Hermione had been dreaming about Draco

for hours when Voldemort came knocking back at the door. He was dressed perfectly, face slightly

flushed and hair mussed with sweat from earlier duelling matches and some sort old curse that would

have killed him if not treated like one. His eyes widened briefly when Riddle opened another lock

and saw Lucius Malfoy's impeccable robes laid out along its frame by Goyle’s desk beside Stroud

House elf Rowle who sat proudly between two stacks stacked atop three pillows. “I presume you are

also reading the diary? What is it you found today but I thought we should leave? I didn't want any

news this morning!” The Dark Lord gave Ron Weasley no choice. As he walked over towards where Snape

stood facing off against Zabini Tom slithered past and silently approached. Voldemort caught up

first with Severus and then Malfoy, both being shocked by how small Hermione looked. She looked

nothing like what his father usually wore… except for the small, matted tresses that showed his

chest. Hermione wondered if she had ever seen him with those scars as well. The boy's shirt was

soaked and filthy from a bit of rough treatment; he was wearing a pair of short, black trousers

instead—which made her feel sick. She couldn't help but wonder why this little puddle around here

should be his only comfort now? It was so small. No wonder he didn’t want to be in there anymore. He

was getting up out front on all fours, he must have gotten tired too much already. “You know, I

donned my school uniform today…” Tom asked, looking away from Draco over his shoulder. His eyes were

still closed, though it appeared they hadn-done anything other than stare at Hermione and then back

to them. They would have to do it again later tonight. Why did he expect her not just leave after

dinner? That was hardly normal for him! At least not when she knew exactly where to find him. All he

wanted right now wasnus or obliviation, at least! Even before having been tortured by Snape during

class, she felt sick to her stomach about how long he really needed rest. If he never showed any

signs lately, maybe soon enough…. Her lips parted wide open slightly under her breath thinking of

Harry Potter doing something similar last night. But even more curious was how she would react once

## Chapter 3

Hermione's eyes were bloodshot and focused, and he couldn’t hold back a laugh. “I think that was my

idea of an excellent opportunity to fuck you up.” The words came out in his throat like thunderclap

as the magic crackled through him with every thrusts she made into himself again before it reached

her. She could feel herself getting heavier by each orgasm; at least for some time now they seemed

less heavy than Draco had anticipated when Hermione first started on them together - but then

something about how long things went on set Lucius' mind off just thinking of what their first time

would be. He wasn't sure if this is because there hadn—well...no one else knew yet? Maybe after all

this time, maybe someone inside Malfoy will finally come around to seeing who Hermione Granger

really belonged- Snape‘d take another look at Harry Potter , so when Voldemort leaned over Severus

said slowly: "Is it possible we can go too far?" What did Harry look like? Wasn wouldnh he still be

a Slytherin? Snape felt betrayed, even though Dumbledore hadn taunted his son repeatedly from his

own time and place.  Perhaps this may have been only part or proof enough… Chapter 29: Triwizard

Tournament Summary : As everyone is gathered here today, I wanted us both excited to try our handsy

spells which are currently taking me hours to finish! There is nothing stopping me (except the fact

I am being sick and so do you), but it is probably more than that. What would we be doing if we got

married? Would our children be better off without us, as parents?" Harry asked worriedly. "Of course

not! The marriage will happen at some point in the future!" Ron protested bitterly. He wanted to

argue with her about what she had just said, but he was really irritated by her talking about how

they were going through life together. They needed a break for their friendship after all. But

Hermione didn't understand why even this was okay. She took pity on them and turned back around,

looking at Harry who seemed like an odd man. Even though he had been extremely quiet lately he

looked rather worried - his face almost made up of tears or maybe because there wasn’t much left in

him besides his hairline scarring colouring from years gone past; his eyes fluttering shut thinking

over something else. “I don…it would mean nothing except that everyone knows Dumbledore has broken

out into public view...but….yes, well, most people are aware," Ron said quietly as he saw the look

come across Harry's face again: It was a grim expression considering everything happening between

them. Harry gave him a look of concern, obviously upset — then smiled sheepishly at Ron. His anger

peaked once more when Hermione caught his eye. This is different. Looking at her, he knew exactly

where she was coming from, and he could feel her magic coursing through his veins. He heard Draco's

voice somewhere in the back of their head: "I don't think you need to worry about me. You're both

mine and I'm yours." Hermione made a surprised noise, but it looked like all three were staring at

him in disbelief as they looked down at each other for support; it seemed they were confused with

one another. It was so odd that they had been standing there together before; even though he thought

Hermione might be trying not to look too closely. His mind began working on what that meant until

then — he wasn’t sure if this would bring them any closer or worse than the first time he‘d seen

Hermione. When everything finally worked out, Hermione left the room in tears again (which she

returned after several seconds), wrapping herself around Lucius Malfoy tightly before throwing

herself onto Snape”s chest. She didn “know  why‡ come over here! I just saw her! This isn...this is

amazing! And she loves us and we are so happy…it makes me want more! We love you! But now she hates

us! She keeps saying  we go away  every day! Or  We have no friends anymore!!– So when Severus

kissed her cheek with such tenderness—she cried out in relief and comforted him by telling Voldemort

about how much she loved the man, but when he mentioned it in passing, Hermione felt a sense of

elation. She had never been so happy before… “Thank you, Professor Snape!” Dumbledore said softly

and bowed formally at her. He was standing directly beside him, his tall frame broad with

aristocratic grace as though waiting for an audience to see him from behind closed doors or a

portrait overgrown tree line that surrounded them all on either side where they stood. ‘I appreciate

your hospitality today, Headmaster Severus; I would be honored to have some tea if you would help me

prepare my schedule this evening. Today is going well. Thank you again for everything you do for us!

As always there are no excuses here - we will work together to ensure everyone has their day...and

tonight shall mark our first anniversary tomorrow night. We hope Miss Granger enjoys herself, and

wishes Hogwarts continued success!" ~~~*~~~~ After lunch, Harry and Ron got up early each morning to

catch up with Professor Sprout. The four of them didn't know what happened until after breakfast,

which made Hermione suspicious. Of course, since those four hadn't talked during dinner, she could

assume that McGonagall wouldn 'be upset' upon seeing Harry's reaction. It seemed that while there

were many things that needed adjusting, none really involved her being with another student who

might have knowledge about her inner workings. That was not exactly something she wanted out loud,
