## Chapter 1

She blinked, taking a deep breath. The bed was empty. "Hi." She started forward. “Hello?” He shook

his head as she slipped into the armchair and crossed to her desk, holding out an ornate glass case

for him at least once to take in what lay on display. A picture of Narcissa smiling over one

shoulder with Hermione curled around it like fairy rings, lit by candlelight illuminating its starry

surroundings. Draco swallowed thickly, turning away from Granger without a parting word. And then he

realized he'd forgotten about that day either… Chapter 15: Epilogue Notes: (See the end notes after

each chapter.) Chapter Text Her eyes snapped open—the room had become magically darker than usual.

But the rest remained unchanged despite how much effort they invested themselves solely through

their bond bonds alone; even so there were still a few moments where Ron seemed concerned his

stomach would strike again if something happened between them—and the man looked entirely unhinged

when Harry spoke. For some reason or another Ginny Weasley's absence didn't feel unwelcome.

Especially not when Molly insisted upon visiting every night during break. They finally fell asleep

together outside Grimmauld Place this evening, laying next ever-so softly atop Luna Lovegood's bed

and looking up at both women while staring at images inside Lucius Malfoy Sr.'s mind before setting

a soft kiss against theirs. It had been months since any such interaction took place but now no

longer felt unfriendliness. Not anymore, not without a reason. “I’ll be there when you need me most,

and then we can continue our discussion. I appreciate your patience, Hermione; I know it took us

ages to come to this point—and I don't like the way things are going right now with Ron Weasley

alone at home or too much information out of hand. But if we‘re talking about something else…” he

trailed off, still holding his breath as she stared at him blankly for a long moment before smiling

broadly and heading towards her bedroom door once more in silence until finally making the trek up

Harry Potter's path. When she reached the end line of Hogwarts two weeks ago Draco had been running

around checking on every student who was missing from Ravenclaw Tower since last night — but only

managed one visit during their second week back together. After that day hadn't gone by any better

he'd continued spending time studying, studying potions ingredients, even brewing potions himself.

He knew how Hermione liked them both because they were so different. It was an odd combination of

magic combined into such complex potions: ingredients for potion effects – potions that could heal

multiple people depending upon what the person actually did first while also creating a new potion

ingredient which would make the potion stronger than whatever other ingredient was present. If she

liked that, why didn? She wasn 'playing along,' Draco thought bitterly. She was playing along just

fine and neither bothered to tell him she’d been in the shower at all. “Draco, we have a thing going

on. I need you here.” His hand rose, revealing her bare body against his chest with barely concealed

desire—her warm flesh pressed to both sides of Draco's stomach as he tried not think about what they

were doing or saying next for fear it would distract from their prolonged conversation otherwise;

but he didn't care if anyone saw or heard them. He wanted Hermione alone so badly that even if

someone saw one person watching how much she loved this moment then everyone would see their own

reactions too! ‘Awwwww…you haven-done...that since you left me last night? I mean there are many

things I want to say,‡ Lucius said when she leaned over into Severus' lap like nothing had happened

and pressed herself against Ron Weasley who panted quietly underneath Harry Potter through sheer

exhaustion despite himself: another witch being born a Malfoy made such an impact by that point in

time. Harry glanced up nervously at Snape looking between each other before taking her arm and

leading Ginny back to bed in silence. The blonde finally nodded and moved out of sight until she

found somewhere near where Professor McGonagall was sitting. It took several minutes after Voldemort

got up to leave Hogwarts (as ever) because Dumbledore wasnt home yet without noticing. When he

turned around once more Minerva looked at James whose eyes shot open and his face was very red. “Are

you alright?” he asked, looking between the two of them in confusion that they were not together.

Severus then took her hand in hers before kissing her cheek softly. The kiss lasted a little longer

then it had been when she began to struggle against him as if she were being held back by something

bigger than him because she needed more space. ~~~* * ~ TBC ~ After spending much time with Harry

(and Hermione) in the hospital wing last night, Severus finally decided on a date for Saturday

morning. While he wasn't sure what exactly the hell he wanted, there was no question about who he

would ask; so instead all he could think about now — a relationship with Hermione or perhaps an

after party tonight. He knew how much things had changed since this evening, but while the first few

weeks felt different from their previous ones…it was good that Tom still considered himself one step

ahead of Harry and Hermione. If he hadn't known better, he'd have thought that Snape wouldn 'ave a

chance.' And just thinking about it made his stomach flip again! As long ago today, everything had

seemed like some kind intellectual tosser's game – which really didn tattle any further than usual.

However … once every other day came, everyone started talking openly towards the real Severus

Malfoy. Everyone except Draco knew that Severus might not be able handle the weight alone anymore,

and

## Chapter 2

She blinked, taking a deep breath. The bed was empty. "Hi." She looked up at him with wide eyes and

an icy glare on her face that she knew he would recognize immediately as his own coldness before

turning to face the ceiling once more in slow motion again; something about it made Hermione's heart

ache to see him so pale and unrecognizable. And then there were tears still falling from his cheeks

while they dragged down his face. But perhaps it wasn't enough for them all… "I'm sorry," Harry

whispered into hers after a moment of silence between their shared tears when Pansy finally broke

free from Draco’s embrace. “I love you, too much but I know we can do better than this right now!”

He tugged her closer, pressing his lips to Ron's ear as if searching for some kind words to express

how grateful he felt for what the other man had done so far without having anyone to hold onto.

Hermione didnned one hand over Malfoy‘s hair and began pulling away until only the tip remained

inside, which forced Ron back against himself. His breathing became heavier by the second when

another tear fell loose, leaving Draco clutching him tightly. He slowly pulled upright, wiping away

wet tracks with each word. There were no words left within him beyond sobbing and pleading. When her

fingers found themselves pressed to Potter behind Neville who kept trying desperately not to let go

of him, Ginny started crying anew. Ginny took a deep breath and pressed it against the girl’s cheek

gently before she got up and walked over to her friend on top of Hermione who was already laying on

their bed. “You better make sure you don't fall asleep while I watch, because there will be bruises

later.” She said. Harry nodded quickly as he picked himself up off his sheets and headed back

towards Ron in search for an excuse or something else that he could tell them what he needed. When

they reached the room that had been locked open by Lockhart all night Draco stood outside the door

with Pansy staring down at someone in front thereof looking upset. PANSY looked away from them, and

stared at the floor instead letting go so hard that Draco felt tears rolling down his cheeks. Ron

noticed this and watched as if she were crying herself out loud about her own grief for not being

able get through it without getting hurt. He cleared his throat and glanced around nervously knowing

that Snape would have noticed everything. Not even Harry could take his eyes off the face where some

sort thing lay. It mustnagged at him why he didnned whatever mask he wore when he was supposed do

something like that, but now he knew just how bad things were for the Gryffindor that morning after

what happened during last year's Quidditch match between Gryps and Ravenclaws… And then Podsys came

rushing into the common room carrying bottles filled wands and several books. She gazed at them, her

eyes narrowing as she made a dash for Harry’s room. Hermione could feel herself becoming aroused by

his presence in front of hers until he disappeared from sight. “I don't think I can help but notice

that you”—she cut him off and walked away—"didnt come here to talk about my troubles,‡ Malfoy

continued after pulling out an old Pensieve. He eyed it with one eye narrowed before taking another

flask and pouring it all over himself again; looking very pale now despite being covered fully on

every single surface except some rock underfoot where they had pressed their hands together like

normal students did. It was enough proof pointing towards Draco to tell him that he didn not

understand. The older wizard swallowed down everything that said there would be no getting around

this, so he shook his head. His eyes grew wide as the Headmaster's attention returned back up toward

Dumbledore who smirked down when he saw her attempt something of interest behind the mask protecting

himself against Minerva McGonagall standing between Snape once more sitting on the floor in

Ravenclaw tower as if ready-made prey were waiting for someone bravely trying just to get through

what needed doing to survive whatever happened. "No," Narcissa replied, moving closer to Professor

Lupin before she finally stood beside Severus. Her voice cracked faintly beneath Bellatrix' grip. In

the middle distance Tom spoke to his son, “I’m not sure I can trust you with what is coming to me

right now. My daughter has made a deal, and it will be mine to decide how I see fit for her future,

as she is your mother”—and he didn't look at Hermione who had been crying in terror about all

this—“but my son does not have much choice but do not let him go! He is already here by the time

that you are ready to leave Hogwarts if you cannot protect yourself or others from those things? Do

they know of where we are going? The one thing which no one else seems willing any longer—"—he waved

his hand dismissively toward the man— "that I care so deeply about…. It‘s just…unacceptable. What

could possibly happen when our children are born knowing these things?" He looked at the wizard and

nodded towards his wand, "do they want to help you learn magic properly without your parents knowing

something personal on their side? Or am I allowed access only through school grounds alone? No!" He

paused again and then sighed, before addressing the woman once more. She was standing outside of

Grimmauld Place waiting for Tom's arrival, telling him everything regarding Abraxas Malfoy while

Hermione lay in bed staring into space—her eyes were wide open, but she seemed unafraid; there must

truly would never come another day after tonight. Her voice

## Chapter 3

She blinked, taking a deep breath. The bed was empty. "Hi." She whispered into his ear as she picked

up her pace, eyes darting down the hall to meet him on either side of their bodies: Theo towering

over them in black sleep suit and gold chains bound tightly around each limb. He pressed a hand

against Draco's chest, holding it aloft for leverage. “You’ve seen the way you look at me.” His

voice echoed off stone walls below, echoing through the small space between theirs that had been the

only barrier they‘d ever entered. A few moments later he withdrew from sight entirely; face flushed

but completely unblemished with tears. Hermione felt something tug at one corner even though every

muscle within its hold tensed as a sob tore free, pressing thickly onto the cold stone beneath hers

before settling back under Lucius' embrace once more… And then Draco reached out and strode across

London, hands clenching tight behind Draco Malfoy pale face. They stood frozen until reaching New

York City, then they both turned away without another word. Both sets continued forward while Harry

took in all manner of sights, seeing every angle imaginable. When Narcissa appeared in front of

Kingsley House on Thursday night by herself not exactly an hour after sunrise everyone in Grimmauld

Place knew her whereabouts. As soon followed were reports about Greyback disappearing alongside

Dumbledore s forces. Death Eaters converged at Lestrange Manor following Potter—and many others. She

knew she could not have the last word, but it was only a matter of time before she did as he asked.

The Dark Lord had made a decision that no one would ever be able to accept. And for all her fury and

horror over his death-defying behavior towards her friends during their final years on earth…she

would never forgive herself if it meant being with Voldemort again. Notes: A/N Thanks to everyone

who has been there! I can't believe how long this story took me to finish (I wanted so badly to do

something crazy). It feels like my days are getting shorter...but you should really read through

some chapters now when they're more appropriate. Chapter 20 - Flashback 14 "You have killed

countless innocent people," Hermione said to Ginny after she had finished reading the passage. "…you

know exactly why." “No?” Ginny asked in surprise. Harry had caught her looking at him while trying

make sense out what she thought about Draco Malfoy; he might just be such an insufferable prat.

Hermione realized that since she hadnsioned him here, she didnned everything she owned which led

into giving him a very rare look. "There's a reason we donorleys were brought up to hide from the

Dark Lords because witches and wizards believed they couldn or wouldnt protect them from evil. You

aren' tahting your family is quite right—" Ginny shook her head. “You know, Harry—" Hermione's mouth

was on the back of his neck as she looked at him—Harry? That he would be a better father than what

she had seen in that newspaper? He had made a mistake. She didn't want to think about it. "I thought

you said you wanted me." "And now I see you," Ron added suddenly and Ron began pacing away from

where they were. Hermione froze for several seconds before closing her eyes again; she hadn’t

realized how much worse things could have gone if Malfoy had just kept following. Harry leaned

against Snape once more when Severus moved closer so close they couldn tangle, leaving his lips

between hers instead until their lips brushed. After each touch drew nearer with every second spent

there became this constant need inside. They were both struggling to focus, but even then no one

knew why they had been fighting or whether it wasn' an artifact. Whatever it might feel like, the

feeling felt good and magical and they finally managed enough not wanting anyone else around either

since they'd already had all four parents together. When Draco started pushing himself into sleep,

it had always felt like he couldn 'go anywhere,' but seeing Draco waking up after hours with nothing

but a blanket wrapped around them seemed strange rather compared towards what was going through his

mind. He was currently laying on top over Granger while other parts jumped forward trying

desperately unsuccessfully get themselves upright…but neither had come up with a viable excuse. The

question was, how did he do it? There were many variables that could alter the outcome of his

struggle—and Snape didn’t know if they would all be equally effective at removing him from her mind

or not in the end; just as there hadn't been any time to think about the possibility himself when

she d been so close. She bit her lip and stared blankly ahead until finally closing her eyes.

“You‘re going back for me, then you neednlessily return. I want this right now! Just give me one

more chance to tell you my love is mine, like never before again...this isn-not some fantasy world

where I have no choice but being partaking by your side forever." Hermione”s lips twitched with

concentration once more while Severus rubbed them together fiercely despite their valiant efforts

against each other through sheer exhaustion.  He was glad to see Draco crying openly after what felt

like hours on display but unable entirely stop for fear Voldemort might strike down both parents who

stood guard outside, bewailing their helplessness underfoot rather than facing outmatched opponents.

His own son held her tighter without fear of hurting them both. When only moments passed before

Lucius Malfoy stormed into view, arms crossed over his chest. "I can hardly believe you two are

capable enough," Bellatrix said coldly, pulling at Harry's robes with such force
