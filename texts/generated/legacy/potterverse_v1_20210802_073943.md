## Chapter 1

“Shall we get you up to bed then?” Fleur asked, breaking role. ‘Yes. I will,’ Hermione said with a
smile as she followed the blonde into her room and left. She had never been in this mood before and
was quite pleased that Fleurs were already dressed for bed. Hermione looked down at her naked body,
trying not to let it show on her face. It was almost like an image of herself being bare around her
lover, but instead showed Fleuring features. Her legs spread wider than usual and she quickly got
out onto one arm, giving the Veela a warm hug. "I need sleep," Hermione whispered against his neck
gently until she felt him pull away. Fleure moved slowly towards them, kissing each way so softly
they almost couldn't hear what was happening between their bodies. They kissed every inch
comfortably together. Their breathing became heavy and slow as they held each other tightly. The
brunette began moving again, pressing even deeper inside her while the veela stayed put. After about
ten minutes or so when the kiss ended there came another loud cry from the bathroom door.
________________________________________________________________ Chapter 11: A Day at Least Not Once
Summary: Hermione is sitting by Lavender's bed talking quietly amongst themselves after getting off
work during lunch break. Ginny keeps telling Hermione how much he misses her; though once Harry gets
home Ron has decided not go back here yet because he feels something strange going through his mind
right now. Notes: WARNINGS: Sexually explicit content, and graphic depictions of violence (See the
end notes for more notes.) Chapter Text The only thing stopping him from smiling was a tiny frown on
her face as she stared at them in thoughtfully determined silence for half an hour before turning to
leave. He'd been hoping that Hermione would be waiting for them outside before he left… but there
wasn't any way she’d be letting go of their connection. Not even when they were talking about it!
Even if Snape had no reason not want anything done with Granger, Draco wouldn—couldn “t”grind
himself to herself over what happened tonight; he could feel every nook-and cranny being slammed
into place by those who loved him. It made all sense except one very important part regarding
Bellatrix Lestrange's feelings towards Lucius Malfoy... which Draco knew was because Riddle was
completely blindsided by this revelation, knowing full well what was happening to both men. If he
did find out soon enough, Lucius may have his wand back within days or so. When everything went down
between Voldemort supporters once again without his knowledge? It was too late indeed for either boy
still fighting against him anymore… especially after what Narcissa said. For everyone else involved
though, their fight had never ceased until today — just how much had changed since last night…
Severus couldn'not get enough things up lately. They were finally getting to the bottom of it, and
now they could see that if he didn't mind, then he was off limits. "Thank you," she said in a hushed
tone when her voice had just risen again from under his breath with an audible pop into existence at
any moment like this should be happening: If he wanted something more than some mindless little
nappy trickery or whatever else Draco Malfoy had planned for them all day long, Draco needed someone
who could help him out on his own terms. She didn’t say anything, instead sending back what felt
like another floodgates opening before everyone knew what would happen next. And by floodinggate? He
had no idea. But maybe after everything he‘d been through last night. Just maybe he just got over
himself and just realized how much he missed Hermione Granger -and why he hadn “got her! How does
one man have to love every woman around him?!” Chapter 52: The Secret is Out Summary:- A surprise
visit to Japan- Prompt: 'So where did you learn to kiss your way round?' - "'Cause I saw me do it."
Pairing: Harry Potter/Draco Malfoy Chapter Text After returning home from work, Ron found himself
face down in front of Professor McGonagall's office; waiting for confirmation that Miss Weasley
wasnor Dumbledore meant as Snape first class teacher. McGinny smiled at their shared surprise and
said hello once again while Draco took a seat on the couch. "Thank you for letting me join you,
Draco." "Of course it is, Granger," he nodded to her without a second thought before they had left
him alone in his dorm room and headed towards work. Saturday was going well as usual with the new
Head Boy and his class. They were still working through some of what Sirius had just done but that
didn't mean everything was easy for them, either. Harry's head felt heavy since Hermione had seen
him do something like this during classes so she hadn’t been able tell if his anxiety wasnor
remained or just increased due more and went back home after getting things ready. With a sigh,
Hermione sat down next up in bed and put her arm around Ron who seemed okay enough by not knocking
anything out of his way when he came over last night; but unfortunately neither one answered his
door until finally they got downstairs. After closing it off the rest only made sense that they
would be talking about it later today instead? She knew from earlier she wouldn “get much sleep
tonight” but now that it all started being mentioned she couldn…not anymore. Her entire body
stiffened slightly knowing that there was nothing wrong with her response and making sure she could
talk herself into staying focused upon his words rather than her own thoughts regarding Remus
specifically. As time passed she wondered how long it would take to figure out where Snape and
Dumbledore had gotten away. She thought it might be a good idea that they’d been sneaking around the
castle, but she doubted it. If Severus were involved in an attack on Hogwarts or Moody—which he was
not currently anyway; his assignment would have no bearing upon any of this at all if there weren't
other means for him access here before curfew. Hermione nodded as best her head could manage when
Bellatrix reached out with one hand grabbing onto something that held little fingers instead so
Bella wouldn ‘wake up' the dragon who walked through their front door. When she did finally wake
again only then did Harry come running towards them. They hurried over after him and stood facing
each others head still. “Bellamione? What is going wrong!?” Sirius asked, grabbing both hands to
hold them together. He wrapped himself tightly around Lily while Draco grabbed hers too close to let
them fall apart. Ron whispered in their ear and took her arm gently shaking her back trying
desperately hard enough against herself to keep her upright. Bellamy watched as the two dragons
slowly disappeared into darkness. The only thing left to do was run forward to see what happened.
Sirius looked down looking up from his book waiting for the time now passed. It wasnt until everyone
was gone that Hermione realized how worried she must really feel about her parents being found and
Voldemort being caught. Not much later, just hours later that night, they were lying side by Side
pressed against each other. Harry groaned softly as he took in the sight of his mother’s face and
looked into her eyes. “I love you Hermione! I don't want to leave any room for fear you might kill
me if you try again!” He had spent so long in that position begging Draco not be hurt because he was
afraid of what he thought would happen after watching this scene unfold; it had been a difficult
decision to make on both sides. It seemed like everything he wanted now, wasnt just something he
could use as bait or an excuse for all those things he did to others. So instead their hands rested
on one another's shoulders. A soft hand kissed him back, but before Severus could even get close
enough—and kiss hard enough through at least part half way through with kisses—the door opened
again… And then a tall figure walked out of there with dark hair standing directly ahead them. The
Dark Lord had entered and entered quickly from behind his shield keeping the entrance concealed
between himself only slightly wider than it already stood and made no attempt whatsoever toward
Draco Malfoy. Snape watched as Voldemort began making rounds around everyone in silence. Everyone
started moving towards him, looking for anyone who didn-not look up to meet either wizard. Severus
didnned black robes and stepped closer slowly until he caught sight where someone else lay there
unconscious on top when Dumbledore came crashing down upon him. Looking over his shoulder, Kingsley
sneered: "How dare you insult our Muggle friends with such vile language!" "There's nothing wrong
with that! I'm not insulted by any of your names or accents, but my mother had a bad reaction when
we were all together in the first place." Hermione shivered faintly at this comment and shook her
head as she looked up sharply to see Kingsly watching her with a cruel grin on he face; it was like
staring into an abyss where there would be no escape. He suddenly sighed inwardly, shaking his head
against something else beside him trying hard enough so tears wouldn't fall freely onto his face.
And then another look came across his eyes, a sharp hint towards sadness crossing his features, and
for some reason even though she could see through the confusion she didn’t know what it meant. She
heard a soft voice again from behind them – “I suppose I should start explaining things," Harry said
slowly as he glanced around nervously, his gaze darting down curiously. It was Hermione who broke
into a wide smile, as if giving Hermione the chance answer for herself. This was the woman who stood
next Tom Riddle and said something very rudely. That was saying a lot. But before she knew what they
said to each other, Lord Voldemort emerged from the dungeons looking quite tired and worried. "Hello
there Potter?" Ron asked, looking between the two of them. Harry nodded, doing just that, shifting
awkwardly

## Chapter 2

“Shall we get you up to bed then?” Fleur asked, breaking role. ‘Yes! What do I need a reminder of?
You know how much that means for you and your baby sister.’ Hermione nodded her head in agreement
but left the room before they could continue on their task which was Draco staying with his parents
upstairs while she tried not think about the situation from time-totime. A few minutes later Harry
got up and went over what had happened since he arrived back down the hall and took out an empty
glass bottle. He handed it into Ron who nodded and gestured at him as he poured it onto one side so
there wouldn't be any mess around the crystal cupboard. Hermione watched the two adults approach the
door and looked them both over carefully before opening the latch. She made sure no sound came out
when speaking because it sounded like someone was shouting something and she couldn even hear
herself if she wanted anything spoken. "You alright, Harry?" Hermione asked surprised by Harry's
reaction. The blonde shook his head once again indicating that he would wait until he was finished
drinking before getting ready himself; although he knew very well this was going completely mental
considering what he'd seen today. They sat quietly together staring at each other blankly talking
silently or watching television playing games during dinner. Harry decided after seeing what Snape
had done involving Bellatrix that it was safe enough just to sit still instead listening to Hermione
talk without drawing attention to themselves. As they talked the door opened and Snape’s eyes met
hers. “Come in,” she whispered quickly as he walked over her back into his office where there was a
large desk with papers and several other things. He placed them on top of one another before moving
across from Draco onto Severus who sat next him on their side facing each others shoulders as well
so that only they could see eachother closely. It took some time for Draco once more noticing the
two men; but by the end it had become clear that Hermione Granger hadn't been hurt or taken
advantage enough to leave while also being perfectly put together. When Severus noticed it all
Hermione quickly moved away from Ron giving Harry an apologetic look which made Lucius feel
uncomfortable in front howling in frustration at what he thought was completely inappropriate
behavior. Severus looked down at the papers resting on the table beside Hermione‘s desk reading
aloud under heavy scrutiny until finally following behind him; his expression remained neutral even
as angry at him as when he saw Harry  ignoring Hermione. But then he realized something; that Lucius
had done something to his friend just like Hermione did. That Lucius Malfoy was purposefully
manipulating the situation around them both intentionally. Forcing someone else's life out of
Hermione and causing this to happen not long after. The guilt he felt towards Lucius about what had
happened immediately dissipated instantly leaving him feeling slightly less guilty than ever before.
Draco leaned forward looking at Severus once more and smiled slightly as he pulled back from her
lips and closed his eyes. He took a deep breath and slowly opened them. They were both breathing
deeply, Severus cupping one shoulder and kissing the other side of Hermione's face softly with
kisses that were like caresses. "So beautiful," Lucius murmured softly after taking in the sight
beyond their couple standing together. With no warning or protest, Snape released his lips until
they had both fallen asleep. Chapter 23: Underneath The Sun Summary: Prompt: “I thought you’d be all

I don't own anything. AN1: Thank you guys who voted!! Chapter Text Over two days later Harry was
still awake while Lucius and Ron slept. It was probably even more complicated than she'd assumed
since they both had a lot of experience with that subject. It was weird, because she didn't like the
idea at all—or at least not right now anyway in this case: after what felt like an hour or so ago
and her brain's best guess of when it would wake up from its stupors again..  It wasn’t exactly
clear why he felt sick; apparently he was trying to get something off his chest rather quickly; it
took him several minutes before Draco let out a sigh as if relieved by Hermione having passed away.
He looked down at himself for some reason while waiting on Ron Weasley-Snape return home (he hadn)
but his mind wandered back to just how much he missed Ginny...and maybe if that were true then he
would be able help bring them together later tonight. That night seemed different in ways neither
one wanted been expecting. She had been wanking openly through each hole of Snape till nearly
midnight, which made no sense whatsoever. The way Malfoy fucked her during their break, coupled
specifically there being nothing wrong about it--it seemed normal even for someone who could clearly
see that he loved her sexually, making sure every thrust had absolutely zero impact upon either girl
too well wrapped around any other aspect except their bodies.--Severus had spent most evenings at
Grimmauld Place sleeping, but he also went into full swing once breakfast arrived three days early.
When James Potter returned from work the next morning Severus almost immediately decided to wake him
up. Harry stepped into his bed and tried not thinking about what was going on in front of him but
found he couldn’t focus properly so he sat down at one end, trying again with a pillow Severus had
been putting on for several hours now would be impossible if it wasn't because Snape had come back
after lunch early Saturday morning. ‘What is it?” Harry asked, looking around nervously Severus
could feel himself becoming worried that something was wrong. He turned around and walked over to
where Hermione lay, gently pressing herself against her pillow, “what happened? What happens when
you stop talking?!‡ The panic started growing louder and louder as more and longer flashes filled
the room Voldemort kept repeating every word until the panic grew worse. After three days alone,
Hermione finally got some answers she needed to know…  I don right here! I can  not talk anymore!
How are you!?‭ She said screaming out, tears streaming freely onto Ginny's face, "how is Ron?!"
Looking at his watch, feeling sickly confused, he shook his head before asking, once again: Why
haven- Merlin! When did this happen? It felt like months ago…. ‪What does she want? Are we really
leaving our son alive or do you have plans for him? Where am I? Can you stay there while we find
someone else? Do we need help? We just gave each other a warning and you didn’t even want to come. I
can see that. And it‘s not like we haven't seen each others in ages, either." Hermione nodded
quickly before reaching for the books again as she placed them on her lap around Draco's chair next
door: "I'll make sure of this, don' t be late if you're going out with me." After checking for any
missing texts and parchments, Narcissa turned her attention back towards Harry who was silently
sitting on his bed, reading between rows along one wall while trying desperately hard at keeping his
eyes open. “Where did you learn about magical creatures from first?" he asked softly. He had started
off by talking about Muggle-borns; they were so often underrepresented in society, but now all he
knew was that these were some rare species which could be easily identified by breeding, though
still very dangerous as well – what do those species have been doing since their birth? Could there
really possibly exist anything else besides muggles or dark magic? Chapter 2 Notes:- A/N: Hey guys!
This chapter is huge, because everyone wants to know why my super secret santa sent us something
called 'ancient lore'. It” - literally means "the secrets that are hidden behind the veil", doesnus
mean 'hidden behind'? There is no hint of sarcasm here (aside from the lack thereof) is definitely a
continuation of my previous comments and has nothing to do with her. I would appreciate it if you
both had any feedback on this, or have questions about anything related in any way :) Chapter Text
Hermione’s head began spinning when she felt Draco walk into his room. She turned around just as he
entered. “Hermione?” He asked, gesturing to their bedside table where they were standing. His eyes
scanned over them. The woman was wearing plain white robes that hugged her down to an even slimmer
waist, almost like some kind duvet, but made no visible movement beyond one breastbone line. Her
hair flowed easily through its heavy drapes and tresses, falling back onto herself behind each ear
while still maintaining its silky smoothness. It seemed odd for him not knowing about what exactly
occurred between these two men, especially since he was the only one who hadn't seen these women
before. But despite all appearances everything looked right; Draco Malfoy wasnn' looking at whatever
witch they presented—or rather, he didnned the same vestigial dress upon which those particular
thoughts filled within him. Hermione stared out the window, feeling goosebumps rise up her spine
every time she saw Harry Potter. And then there stood Theodore Nott… Well maybe we shouldn- uhm...
she thought frantically, trying desperately hard NOT TO LEAVE THESE TWO LIES IN THE DARK. If anyone

## Chapter 3

“Shall we get you up to bed then?” Fleur asked, breaking role. ‘Pleeeease! I can’t believe you said
that about me yesterday!‡ Hermione exclaimed as she sat on the edge of her bed and looked down at
herself in embarrassment. She had been so good today! The brunette let out a small moan and kissed
her forehead gently. After finishing their meal together they left Fleurs alone and returned home.
Chapter 30: Part III Notes: (See the end for notes.) Chapter Text FORTY-EIGHT Thursday morning came
without any real event. It was early enough that Hermione and Harry were already close by, but not
quite full. They both heard the sound from the kitchen and headed towards breakfast with Ginny when
Ron called them back into his quarters earlier than usual. "You three are late. That's okay," he
said as they entered their room for dinner after leaving the Great Hall and closing the door behind
him. He took off to sit next only letting the French food slide over his lap before sitting just
outside of the bedroom window while waiting. Just like most people did during lessons he ignored the
noise coming from inside his dorm and went straight to sleep. When he woke it felt like hours away
or at least less. But if anyone could go back in time and change the past there was no way right
now. This had happened hundreds upon thousands times since they arrived here first. Every single one
is gone." Remus explains as he pulls the robes off of Hermione's body and throws them on his bedside
table in the living room. "We've missed you too, Papa." Harry says with a smile when there are no
signs of him around to look at or sound surprised about that but instead of being angry it just
gives way into anger because both Fred (who has been looking forward for over twenty minutes) have
seen nothing wrong so if neither know what happened after seeing this before then who knows where
things will end up either ways. Even though Sirius isn't able to tell anything apart from how upset
she is feeling right now alone like everyone else wants her home again; once people leave behind
everything becomes even more difficult due to all the horrible memories lying out along the walls
every minute of every day until someone finally manages come across something new enough to explain
themselves properly without losing their voice anymore. PLEASE REVIEW Chapter 22 FOR PROMPT #18

As soon as George was done dressing back down by Snape walking towards the common room Neville had
been sitting on, being thankful that he didn’t have to walk back up. He turned around so Draco was
standing behind him and then walked over with a smile as he moved toward Harry and Hermione. “I
thought we should all take this… meeting in private again?” Harry asked curious. Draco smiled at him
before leading them both into their office. Before they could get any further information about what
their next move would be there were two doors open underneath them when Snape entered. "Mr Weasley,
you are going." Severus said giving his son a slight nod of acknowledgement. The Slytherin who stood
closest kept his eye out for anything suspicious but none came close enough or able properly to find
it; either way though, he wouldn't let it happen again unless it meant making an immediate impact.
After clearing his throat Severus began speaking. "…are you sure Miss Granger is alright?" Ron asked
concerned. Severus smirked down at his boy once more raising his eyebrows briefly trying not make
him look like something else than childlike looking so much less menacing. As soon did however come
true everyone inside the room started whispering questions regarding her condition as she got ready
leaving the classroom door unlocked. A few minutes later when everyone left Snape led Harry
downstairs heading straight after Minerva. Walking slowly followed closely following behind until
finally stopping just outside of where Minerva's office sat. Once only feet away from the door
Lucius gently strode past, leaning against a desk and looking around as he spoke. "What are you
doing here?" He asked Draco in a low voice before setting his glass down on one of their chairs to
take a sip. The room was still dimly lit by moonlight, but Lucius could make out his face clearly
through its thin curtain between them; there were tiny circles where eyes met with blue-green irises
that made him want more than anything else inside himself: something beyond just him being alive
anymore - maybe even Voldemort had been able somehow access some sort connection to Malfoy's mind.
As he reached the end table for another drink Lucius set his cup on it without looking up at
Hermione or Harry again while staring into her eyes in confusion – everything would be fine now,
they'd just had their fun together, and no one wanted any kind of trouble from them. It was all so
easy to forget about everything else. What Severus said to him wasn't entirely true, Lucius knew the
truth, as much because Snape had not mentioned it until this very moment. That Lucius' magic allowed
him such freedom and control over the Dark Lord hadn’t been lost on anyone since Narcissa died; if
anyone thought Draco felt the same way about Luna Lovegood he had when she was young, it simply didn
‘came out wrong.' And then what? Wasn taming love to begin last year? What did Lucius mean after all
these years? Had he left Lily to him, or was it the other way around? He didn’t know. No one knew
about this—but even then Severus had been prepared for a confrontation with Dumbledore. But now that
his feelings were exposed and what they might have meant for him personally… What would Snape do
next? Would he let it go through before things got better?, Severus could only imagine what Snape
would say if something bad happened in the future when his son came along. And how would Severus
deal...? He tried not thinking too hard over everything he‘d just learned as soon-after Harry
returned from their magical reunion at Hogwarts. The lessons had never really come into focus on the
boy, but Severus  knowledge of them did. He”d always suspected Voldemort had some kind intellectual
capacity, given his father's proclivities toward knowledge more than anything else; but apparently
he had no interest whatsoever being told off like an old fool by someone who thought he possessed
such talent! “I think you may want me dead, Severus Potter, so I will let your thoughts flow freely
until my demise.‡ With those words out loud Hermione tore her eyes away from Draco Malfoy looking
down at himself. She felt tears welling up inside her right now and she knew that this couldn't be
good. Her body ached, every nerve ending burning painfully under each heated breath. It made sense
why Lucius should try running back to tell her: "No." "You have no idea," Hermione said, trying not
to laugh at that. Draco had been a fool when he thought she would be his best friend by the end of
their school years; he had come to her in a tizzy and told him what was going on with Ron's mother.
He couldn't help but think that if they were friends, they wouldn’t want either one together. She
might even think differently about the fact it wasn “special" for them all – because there was only
so much love between them. The war had done nothing for Ron or his family — he just felt left out as
well (with his parents, too). It was hard enough dealing this way with his mother after being
separated from him for almost two years after they moved into Malfoy Manor. But now…she didnned an
ugly suit and was wearing jeans right here in front! Her hair is messy now, which made things
harder; it gets tangled up like something you'd expect from someone who has been in bed for months
straight without proper care. "I am sorry," Harry whispered against hers again before he pushed
himself off the ground, pulling her closer. They sat quietly for several moments. Even though Draco
knew that she didn-wouldn—not really believe anything he said. That he would use force toward her
tonight, knowing that people donalding out every time he did something stupid until he got caught up
killing more people than she had been able to kill. She was beginning, though it didn't seem to last
long. He looked down at the ground, not even bothering with a nod of his head. "I'm going now." His
eyes flashed with an intent that reminded Hermione how many times they used those exact words in
their arguments. There were times when Draco wanted her or someone to take him back from them and
then just stop and stare into their eyes. It reminded Neville if anything he ever heard what it
meant for him like a curse would. Her eyes grew dark as she continued on towards Harry's dormitory
suite where Ron walked past her bed. Harry stood by himself staring at Ginny who was pacing behind
him. When she came out from under one arm covering Neville once more, she looked so much older;
likely six years. Hermione couldn’t help but smile again as her heart swelled in appreciation for
Draco Malfoy knowing that she was there for only herself and it helped. “Hey, you okay?” Daphne
asked as Harry reached over Luna through Theo while sitting next Toogy. The blonde frowned slightly
before nodding. As soon as he knew that they weren— Draco sat forward and squeezed her hand tighter.
Dora let go slowly looking around nervously. Draco wasnned back straightening against Lilly, who
looked peaceful despite being very tense all day. Noticing Draco still standing side-byside with
Blaise
