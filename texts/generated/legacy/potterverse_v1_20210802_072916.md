'“I get it, Ron. But if you ever think mine and Fleur’s sex life is any of your business,'

## Chapter 1

“I get it, Ron. But if you ever think mine and Fleur’s sex life is any of your business, I will tell
you that all those years ago, we had our own private lives—and that was okay, because no one could
have imagined what would come after us. Harry always has a point there. He saw things in Hermione
Granger” (she said she loved him so much), “before he came here. It wasn't easy to be with her when
we were both younger than us; I didn...he just thought they weren…at least, not like us at the time
but maybe soon enough. And Draco Malfoy, too? He was an older man then! He‘s…different now,‡ Bell
reminded herself.) "But my relationship never changed," Hermione argued quietly against this answer
from Ron Weasley on top off his sister's question as even though she felt sorry for him, she couldnt
deny that it did change everything about them. She wished she could say something or do anything
really hard right now. Surely, it would only make matters worse, but who knew how long their
friendship might last forever, while the two young witches grew old together? Would they still have
feelings toward each other? After months back between their parents being married almost exactly
half-way through summer vacation next year, Hermione finally realized that perhaps her mum would
feel more comfortable letting her see such things anymore, despite the fact some of these memories
are still there. I was never fully aware that you were a normal person; an average man with a
family. It felt as though everything was slowly coming together for you at that point." "I know,"
she said in truth and sincerity while he spoke. He gave her a smile and then added: "…he only told
me to get back when the time is right." She rolled her eyes and looked down at him once more before
returning them both towards their dormitory room where they sat silently for several minutes until
finally they drifted into silence again, gladness in between each other's faces as they tried not
think about what was going on around Hermione Granger in general or how she was trying so hard
lately… "It all happened like clockwork this time of year." Draco chuckled slightly but didn't
respond to his request nor did Harry feel sorry for his friend. Instead it just made his stomach
flutter on its own accord and he turned to face the room again. "So anyway…" The next day, Malfoy
was sitting by himself studying his homework from work assignment against Professor Slughorn's desk.
Hermione had been given permission last night to sit across from Snape after class began and walked
out onto Riddle's office floor alone without taking notes either way. When the two of them got close
enough even if it meant walking through the doorways Ron pulled away and left behind a few papers
attached to one end which they both went over quickly. "Oi, that's ridiculous." Hermione said before
she could stop herself from smiling at Draco who was starting his walk back towards the castle. She
had never seen him so happy with her and this did not sit well in any way with him. He smiled
slightly as he walked away a few steps after she left. There were many people looking around while
others were just staring at him suspiciously. It didn't help that when he started walking out of
there he stopped behind her on either side. As soon as they reached the spot where the group was
heading it was gone. The silence between them grew almost unbearable because everyone was trying
their best guess what would happen next. Many of them knew exactly how close to Hermione Ron or
Harry would be by then but still couldn’t believe someone else saw them standing together again.
When they got closer to the large house the two older Slytherins found themselves being pulled into
an open door right up against the wall. They began opening and closing doors; even though they
realised nothing was going through the door until now. “Shit, Malfoy!” A voice said softly coming
forward. Once inside the room Hermione felt relief fill her stomach as she realized if she ever
heard anything like it since last night. This room wasnned by Death Eaters all over Europe. Some
weren thought unworthy to join Voldemort‘s ranks completely and some were already here. One of those
groups consisted mainly older women, with little to no experience in the field or her own home area;
as well they all had a strong sense that there was something serious going on between them and
should anyone wish it so much then it would be prudent for her not only look out their window but
for everyone else who might know about this potentially dangerous situation. It was dark outside and
Hermione wondered if she could ever get through it alone without being seen by many others. If it
was an adult walking around nakedly talking amongst themselves before being sent back to Azkaban
after what Hermione had just witnessed Draco Malfoy had committed murder? She knew at the very least
that he had been doing some kind action towards her when she came into his room during dinner one
evening while he took her arse deep inside him again – which was exactly the type of thing she
wished to see. Her eyes widened slightly from concern, and she looked down where Harry sat up next
beside Neville’s bedchamber table, looking at Ron Weasley with utter confusion over what to say.
“Harry Potter. What is wrong Granger?" He asked, his voice hoarse now even more than before. "What
are you two trying too hard today?” A shadow passed across both girls' faces and Ginny nudged
Hermione curiously. When McGonagall spoke again she saw Professor Flitwick staring blankly ahead.
She felt a rush start building within her heart because she remembered how Dumbledore had been so
much like him, and the thought of trying to force it on his daughter made Hermione’s stomach knot.
Of course, this was all completely ridiculous; he could still be a Death Eater with some sort
connection between them! But then again…well maybe if she wasn't so sure about what Dumbledore
really meant, she could ask Granger why Harry would want Voldemort in Hogwarts as soon after they
were married. It sounded crazy…but that didn ‘t mean she needed an explanation from me!' She
continued down toward Professor Sprout who seemed just as concerned by everything that happened. “So
when you heard about my pregnancy? Is there any reason that your family should have been subjected
such harsh treatment at Hogwarts? If I”m pregnant and you know we re having an affair, or something
likethat isn—I don- I shouldn—"she shook her head, eyes fluttering shut, but not before looking up
at Draco glaring up into Snape's chest while giving Potter another hard look. He turned back to
Ginny, which caused Severus snort out loud: "Don' you dare call us enemies!" Ginny looked back up
sharply, almost laughing aloud: Her gaze went to Lucius Malfoy instead. He stared straight ahead for
a moment longer, studying everyone closely. Then simply shrugged. A small voice said quietly through
gritted teeth : Dear Lordess…. Do we really need more information than what is given today? You must
understand, I am not one to keep secrets. If you have any questions or concerns feel free and ask me
anything at all. I would be happy for you both if your answers are good.” Hermione nodded her head
in agreement with his statement of trust from the other night as well but she was tired of Draco
trying so hard without her on top every day and he needed her there to do everything they could just
to get him where he was. And when his eyes finally opened again, he found himself smiling at
something that made her laugh out loud. “Draco!’ She called back up to see if he had noticed her
arrival before she left. He wasn't surprised; it seemed like the second time around he hadn's been
in the infirmary a lot longer than normal. She paused beside them and gave an awkward nod towards
Ron who smiled widely at her retreating form. Hermione couldnned herself away from their small group
and walked over by Blaise after exchanging a quick glance with Ginny about how much better things
were going this morning. When he stepped aside she placed either side between two sets of ribs,
resting her hand on each shoulder and placing another on either hip. They sat quietly together while
talking about nothing. It felt strange for them to sit next turn into four wizards though.
Especially since they weren' thieving themselves because Harry Potter was a Squib and Ron Weasley
was currently in Azkaban awaiting trial for the murder of a wizard. He also served as one half-blood
Malfoy, who was working with James Potter to overthrow Voldemort. “We’re not going anywhere right
now,” Harry said quietly from his place on Hermione's bedchamber floor so he could get away before
she died like he had planned. It would be unfair if he didn't even know what he was doing at this
moment - because it was only him that knew how to die. But then again… maybe Draco wouldn—just go
back to being friendless and caring about her son. Even when they were all dead, there still wasn...
No matter where they went after Voldemort returned. The memories of Harry becoming friends hadn
been erased by time travel, but their connection still existed. And while it seemed strange; it did
make sense. Because whatever he'd done just might have saved her life or something. A little bit
more than death made him happy. If that meant it could be done? Maybe it would. "Goodbye," Lily
whispered to herself. She leaned over the bed once more until she stood up. Her eyes grew wide and
red spots danced across them towards Scorpius' head. She looked up at Ginny holding out an envelope.
When Hermione saw whom she wanted next: Sirius Black, Peter Pettigrew Sr., Bill Goyle Jr.. Or any
other person whose name floated through consciousness within the span of minutes. In

## Chapter 2

“I get it, Ron. But if you ever think mine and Fleur’s sex life is any of your business, don't take
my word for what I just said; we are not lovers in the slightest." Hermione replied with a small
smile as she turned to kiss Fleurs lips again on her forehead before starting back to their
conversation about the two creatures that had come to talk to each other since they started the trip
up north. ‘We know nothing else than how wonderful this place feels but there isn-” ‡You haven!‪
Harry and Neville shouted together. The Veela groaned at the mention though Draco made a face at it.
They both knew where Draco was going with this. He stopped walking out onto his broomsticks so soon
after getting over to them and walked around the group with an obvious pride in him. Harry gave a
curt nod towards Harry who nodded once more when he saw Draco sitting alone near Ginny and Ron,
staring down at himself in front along from the couch. Neville smirked genuinely while Harry snorted
widely into one hand. "I told you!" Harry said eagerly looking down upon himself before grabbing a
seat next to Draco. Both hens looked uncomfortable between themselves until Draco slid off the seat
beside them. Before anyone could ask why, he sat closer to him and watched them closely. When they
were done, they all stood facing each others and began trying different things. For instance: Blaise
hadn taunted her with his “we’re friends,” or ‘I was just jealous of you because you weren't around
to see me on the train ride in France—it happened too fast for a quick fix, and I couldn- not have
been so sure about the look in your eyes when I saw it. But he looked like hell himself!  He then
laughed at Hermione's disbelief over him saying that, but she didnt seem convinced either way; she
said nothing else. Draco could hear his heart pounding hard in front as he leaned into Theo more
than usual: he wanted this to end well. The same was true from Blanche by extension though, who was
still kind enough within their group all year - maybe even during Christmas - where she had spent
most likely many hours laughing at Theo's antics. As far away from them as they were in London, he
could easily imagine what Granger would say if Theo bumped into her again anytime he got close – how
much love he'd give her? Would there be any point if he made eye contact with her after an extended
period without kissing her or touching her back? It felt good and safe, both physically AND
emotionally…so why did he want to make such a big deal out against her instead?! And now here he is
right beside the trio in a small room, two people together. They are both blushing slightly under
Daphne laying down next to her, “I’m sorry. I didn't mean for you getting upset at me like that and
I don-” she started, but as soon they were both out of breath Hermione burst into tears. ‘Daph - the
only one who can be said with a straight face!‡ Harry said. He was holding her up in his arms so he
could kiss her forehead. As it turned out Ron wasnn t going anywhere until afterwards, which meant
Draco had been right about everything. It had made him feel better than ever before about what he
felt towards his best friend. The day after dinner on Thursday night did not go quite how he wanted
it. When Malfoy came home late from work an hour later Harry found him pacing through Diagon Alley
dressed all red and scarlet for Christmas present – and he knew where this must have gone. Sitting
across Pansy Parkinson's lap was Sade again; Hermione Granger standing beside them, eyes wide and
heart pounding. She looked very angry, Draco couldn  see that clearly. They sat cross legged
together while staring at each other intently over their shoulder whilst listening attentively to
something between Dolohovs words. "Severus," Luna spoke from behind them now sitting close by. Her
voice cracked slightly when they moved closer yet. Standing there in silence Hermione let herself
fall back asleep once more. This time, despite waking up earlier hours he was still asleep and his
body was in the same position it had been when they were left alone. It felt surreal to think about
what would happen if one of them came back from Azkaban after Harry's trial for attacking Hermione.
She knew that she would be there during this time as well but only because of the fact Draco wanted
her to see him again later on? What made her want more than anything else was the thought coming
from Bellatrix Black, who did not seem like a good fit for such an action, even though she had tried
so hard today to keep her thoughts to herself. But just knowing that Snape would let her sleep
tonight wasn't enough. Not with all those nights away at school; now that Voldemort and Sirius
couldn’t find him yet, which meant the Weasley girl might have trouble keeping up. And while he didn
“not care” about her being late for dinner, something had happened between the two teens - before he
could ask how he had gotten into Hogwarts. He took a breath and then looked down at himself
nervously. ‘I don- I…  He cleared his throat slowly and glanced over at Ron where their eyes met
once more. The look never left his face. They both stared at each other for several long minutes
until finally, Ron spoke again: "What do you mean?" Despite his protests Malfoy continued speaking
without looking directly into his eyes as he walked towards Ginny standing next door, still looking
at him. Hermione turned her attention to the witch, but saw no sign of Harry and Ron. She reached
out a hand over it before she began walking down the stairs, glancing around in confusion. "Where is
your friend?" Luna asked when they were about ten feet away from each other. It was late afternoon
now; the sun had begun its evening, making the sky darker than normal due north. The weather became
worse with each passing hour so that it became clear just how cold. When they finally got into their
dorms they found them staring into nothingness while Lee sat up on one knee, resting his head on
Neville's chest, watching her closely. He looked hesitant for a moment until then his shoulders
dropped back onto either side slightly. His expression pinched momentarily causing him not only look
afraid-but also nervous as well which was a relief considering the amount this morning had been like
an agonisingly long day. As they moved closer to where they stood they felt Neville being squeezed
tight by the older man. They both watched as their hands touched, pushing against the younger man
tightly. Their mouths parted lightly giving a small gasp once more finding their way to face
eachother again. For some reason it seemed to make things easier since there wasn't much else left
between them apart from lying together under blankets. After what felt like hours they settled upon
comfortable silence, all of them feeling contented despite the fact that they were still in their
respective rooms. “I was hoping you’d be happy to stay, so I said yes.” ‘Yeah, it would be nice if
we could take our time and come here as soon?  Ron agreed with a smile. Harry grinned back at him,
smiling slightly too close for comfort. Ron rolled his eyes, he had been overly dramatic about it
all week. "Oh no, wait…we'll get there together," he said, knowing full well what he meant by going
over to bed. It didn't really matter anymore because he knew how much better things felt inside of
this room; Draco would know when they got out of work before curfew every night. Hermione smiled
down at her plate, she wasnt sure exactly which book she wanted to read or where she belonged next
but right now, the only thing keeping her from writing was being able go to sleep until morning. She
couldn- How long till then did such an unlikely friendship feel like? The thought of Draco returning
home after lunch brought goosebumps up on her cheeks and her stomach clenched painfully as she kept
thinking about all those times Ginny kissed her goodbye letter weeks ago and how she hated that
moment completely. Not even a year later. But apparently the day she finally wrote letters without
Ginny's permission just made it worse. That, and Malfoy's constant sneering during class came
rushing back to haunt her, making her mind spin as she remembered how his voice had once been. "He
was a good man." She swallowed heavily. His words were just what she needed right now and she felt
nothing but pride at being able to say them. Her heart raced with hope as he gave the final, harsh
syllable of 'thank you.' He leaned down and kissed her gently. The kiss was slow in intensity as
they both studied each other for a moment before turning their attention towards something else that
would finally make sense. Hermione smiled softly at him; it wasn't an apology or anything like this,
only curiosity. “Are you alright?” Draco asked when she spoke. It took all five seconds between
kisses on either side so she didn tangle her hands into fists again until she reached for one hand
holding his chest as if there wouldnt be any time left. She looked up through tears to find Harry
watching them from the corner table while Ron flicked his wand over himself giving Draco a light
pat. Finally Malfoy's voice sounded out telling him not let anyone hurt Granger anymore. For someone
who hated her so much, she could see why he couldnned his mask tightly against hers. He turned his
face away looking at Ginny and then walked behind George where Weasley sat next closest by. As soon
everyone started whispering about themselves together without even realizing it, he shook his head
pulling some strings around the room and sending a string across the floor catching shards of glass
falling off

## Chapter 3

“I get it, Ron. But if you ever think mine and Fleur’s sex life is any of your business, just let me
know! I want to see what our group can do for the future." He sighed deeply as he reached out with
his hand on her shoulder again feeling the pull of his lover‘s magic that had always been there in
their bond. "I don't like to have anyone worrying about me anymore. No one else will be concerned at
all when we're both going through a tough time. You won-” “Harry?  She stopped short looking up at
him, her mouth twisting slightly trying not to look like she was listening carefully. ‡You were
right Bella - Harry is so good at hiding things from me. It's hard enough knowing everything because
it comes pouring off us every single day. My parents are worried but I'm sure they would hate having
you around now that they realise how close Weaslette might feel. So please, stay here okay?" She
nodded quickly turning back towards his side leaning down grabbing his arm holding it firmly
pressing it against hers pulling her into place letting her lips meet his as she kissed him gently
kissing him harder once more before moving forward making her way over toward them. She pulled
herself away releasing him giving Draco her best kiss to endear herself even further to her mate
since then. After another few moments she looked between them walking past the fireplace licking her
bottom lip until she finally stopped crying. She started to sob a little as tears broke free, and
she looked up at Draco with sad eyes before turning to see him looking at Hermione who was currently
staring back into his mother's arms in disbelief. "What are you doing?!" he asked. He could hear her
shaking out of it all so quickly, but when she realized what was going on, without saying anything
else or even blinking at him for fear that he would hurt her, then she put her head on Harry’s
shoulder, tugging him closer. The kiss was intense and passionate, full force from both their
mouths. As they continued kissing fiercely together while holding hands like this wasn't something
normal between them, Ron got caught by Ginny's scent wand. “We can get some more practice
practicing!” ‘You know how I feel about training students hard enough to do things themselves…or not
really," Hermione whispered against Fleur' shoulder as they watched the blonde witch run off
laughing. That night, during sixth year after classes had finished, Luna left Viktor feeling
somewhat guilty over the fact that they were still missing an hour of practice due mostly because of
Fenrir Greyback being taken care of earlier than usual again. It made sense given the circumstances
surrounding it. Still though—he didn...not want himself if he ever did have to go through that again
either. They shared a look once soon afterward, Neville and Hannah standing next to each other. "Why
are we talking about it?" Harry asks as he walks over a table, putting two chairs in front of each
one of them that is clearly not occupied. As everyone stares at the people surrounding the foursome
they realise how much worse things could have been if Hermione had killed him instead because she
hadn't even thought about why Draco didn’t try anything or do anything after what happened last
night. “I can see Ron coming up here with a knife now, telling me everything I need to know…he has
told us all this before." Remus explains when Sirius puts his hand on the boy's shoulder. After
several minutes there isn' any movement from either of their sides but both boys close quarters.
Once enough for an explanation Fred pulls out a small gun which he aims down causing three shots to
be fired across the room towards Daphne who falls unconscious instantly while another one lands near
her friend. A few seconds later Malfoy comes running into the hall where Minerva McGonagall is
waiting looking like she hasnít slept well since leaving Hogwarts so basically every time anyone
looks surprised something happens. Hearing voices Hagrid calls off the door leading to the dorms
only to find himself being dragged through the halls by someone trying desperately too hard. Seeing
no answer Albus hurries past Snape asking Professor Dumbledore whether he heard Filch scream outside
without permission; once more seeing nothing makes Potter jump away screaming until finally Cedric
shows up at the foot of his bed, crying. "CEDRIC." Harry and Hermione yell as they see Ron in pain
as he tries to fight himself. A few minutes later all four people have fallen out, both bleeding
profusely from their wounds. As soon after that Remus is yelling so loud it is clear why Sirius cuts
into him but neither one of them can hear what's going on behind Fred or George’s ears; causing no
real pain whatsoever. “I'm sorry! I need to-” The other boy starts to say before quickly running
over to Albus. Before leaving Minerva hugs her daughter tightly and takes a deep breath, trying not
tear herself away completely because she knows there is nothing else left for when Crouch comes
marching straight through with two sets off his wand. He knocks loudly across the room where Lupin
sits down next door, looking about every inch like old man. There are tears rolling freely onto his
face even though everything looks different except how Peter seems to be holding back something.
Everyone hates Dumbledore if anyone was keeping track here either way, being very sure this isn't
just another bad memory which really only makes sense now since everyone has been speculating lately
who Pettigrew might actually want anymore than twelve months ago—he'd do anything for an assignment
given by Voldemort anyway. When Snape walks past Severus without waiting for someone to come towards
him none too happy appears nearby, standing beside his son. “It’s okay, my boy! He‘s safe here and
he”—he says a little too quietly to be overheard by her—"is kind of you." Sirius tells his daughter,
feeling sympathy for the girl who has been hurting since they were both children. "Yes, it is."
Hermione confirms as she closes her eyes, tears coming to full colour in her cheeks. "…I know what
that means," Remus says, sounding worried about everything being so quiet right now, but also
wanting this conversation to end soon enough because there are people at Hogwarts like hers still
hurt more than ever before. July 27 th 1992 It has only just begun when Professor McGonagall stops
talking to Harry Potter after noticing something unusual happening outside their dormitory room on
Halloween night. As expected, seeing how terrified everyone else was going into classes doesn't help
matters much though; even Neville isnt able ignore all the stares from Minerva's desk while making
sure no one knows exactly where these students are getting detention or if Albus believes them. Not
long after sitting down with Dean Thomas near the Gryffindor table Lupin and Longbottom have come up
with a plan which makes perfect sense once again due out of nowhere not very far away some two days
later during lunch break instead of around Hogsmeade weekend rather than summer day off weekends
usually months ago…which causes Fred/George Weasley (who had wanted to talk about the Lupin-Black
name), Harry, Neville and Ron all burst into applause. The crowd was cheering for everyone but it
seemed that there were a few who thought they weren't going anywhere at all. "Piss off, Mione!"
Blaise called from the side of his house as he joined them in applauding their efforts against
Snape's Death Eaters. A couple moments later Hermione found herself alone in her room, she wasn’t
sure if she should be too embarrassed or worried because of how much she enjoyed the scene involving
James Potter; what with how well he treated her earlier, this didn ‘feel right.' There wasn—that was
why so many people came out: after everything else, watching him throw one last spell on the Potter
boy was very different than hearing someone curse himself again. And then a group formed around her,
grabbing her arm roughly and pulling her back down onto Draco Malfoy like some kind deformed manacle
wrapped itself over hers - just barely stopping when they both fell forward together. They continued
up the stairs until they reached an empty sitting area near King's Cross. Hermione could feel George
doing his best impersonating Kingsley Parkinson while Lee Seamus kept looking over at Ginny waiting
for their arrival. She felt James snickering loudly behind her as they all rushed towards each other
as if nothing was amiss. After five minutes passed between themselves being alone once more, not
wanting anyone to see them as a threat. “So you want her?” Harry asked. Ron shook his head. Hermione
looked away from him with wide eyes and he took a deep breath before speaking again in a low voice:
"I think we all know how it is that I'm supposed have feelings for you." His heart clenched at the
words she said, but they weren't loud enough; neither were their nerves or anger about how much
longer this would be until they couldn… He could feel her arms around his waist like an anchor
holding him still while her fingers wrapped around both of theirs instead flicking up through her
hair. He pressed against hers slowly, trying hard so no one else noticed what was happening. In
short order everyone had started crying. They hadn'recovering' from whatever the hell had happened,
which meant they wouldn... "Draco?" She whispered into Draco's ear, unable even move fast enough to
stop himself completely shaking uncontrollably. The small child cradled her chest over just above
the hemline when he began sobbing anew, his entire body now trembling slightly under his weight.
Harry had been watching him closely every few seconds since then, worried that he was going insane
because of it already too many times. But there wasn- "You're right!" It seemed clear to Draco that
something had gone wrong. And though his emotions were nothing compared on the surface, the truth
had yet only reached him
