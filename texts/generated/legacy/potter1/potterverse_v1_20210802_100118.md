'Once Hermione had managed to pull herself from the endless amounts of terrifying, disastrous,'

## Chapter 1

Once Hermione had managed to pull herself from the endless amounts of terrifying, disastrous, and

frightening things she was doing. Draco did not bother asking about it in the slightest. He simply

stood there waiting for her answer. And then he sat down next towards Snape on a bench near where

they were all sitting, watching as Harry picked up his wand and used magic that wasn’t his own: an

Unforgiveable Curse. The words took him by surprise now; he hadn't seen this before—but when those

marks made sense… ~~~*~~~~ ~ *(See more notes at Cupid's end.) Chapter 28 Notes – Disclaimer – I

Quidditch practice, Harry and Hermione were lying on their side in bed together, staring at each

other with intense concentration; Ron and Neville had been practicing by themselves when they heard

Professor Sprout's voice talking to them from across class. ‘Granger. I can't believe we haven…’

Professor McGonagall was speaking in that kind of way as she said her final words into another

earlobe. Her head tilted up slightly so that it was looking out onto the field. They looked down

nervously but watched as Minerva said something, before turning to face the Headmistress in silence

again now since they hadn't moved around yet— ‡I understand why you are here, Professor Snape!‡ She

smiled to herself as her eyes adjusted back to normal. She had thought about going outside once or

twice last year because there weren 'others', but instead...she had taken a bath while waiting for

the doorbell ringing, and spent some time reading the letter Fleur received during Christmas break.

It had come out an hour later than she'd expected given what she knew of Hagrid over the years. And

then there is that fact that Minerva McGinagall would have let him go if he wasn- So

## Chapter 2

Once Hermione had managed to pull herself from the endless amounts of terrifying, disastrous,

confusing memories, she found herself wondering if maybe it was time for her body and mind again.

She didn't know what that meant yet; she'd have a lot more information than Draco would ever give

her on this matter. Or at least he wouldn’t be able tell her anything about her situation now until

Harry left the room. So when Daphne came out in front with an impressive collection of bookshelves

full as always after sitting in their usual spot across from them all during breakfast they sat down

together in silence, Hermione knew something was up. “What‘s wrong?” Ron asked quietly. He wasn's

father, but he was still his friend, so there weren-he could keep him company. Harry shook his head.

They were both working towards becoming a married couple, with no children between those two years

ago since Draco had taken over and Hermione didnned some kind outfit which seemed tailor made by The

Fawley Manor. That was quite enough considering he had been living off borrowed money - probably

because she was going through withdrawal issues due not only being pregnant, though she thought that

sounded odd given how much time she had spent away from him lately. After explaining to Ginny that

their relationship should work out, then telling Ron who had offered himself up behind Malfoy in

exchange for an early engagement, they stood awkwardly waiting for the other man before nodding once

or twice into each others hands. “I will take you to breakfast,” he said at once and then left the

room with a loud pop that Tom had never heard in his entire life. This time it was from one of the

elves who appeared to be the first person seated there. He sat down on either side next him as they

waited for the elf's reaction when she finally spoke. "I have not known such things," she began

hesitantly but Tom took her hand. She pulled back slightly enough so she could look up at him and

saw that his eyes were wide and pointed, as if he wanted something to say. Her mouth opened wider

just inside his, allowing him more access. His face looked thoughtful beneath the mask of

indifference. It was an odd, strange thing for them both; Hermione knew this was only partial – some

subconscious thought played out behind his closed eyelids. But even though it would seem foolish and

inappropriate now… Something else came over her like heat. The magic coursing through her body

slowly became stronger than ever. Slowly, everything around them dissipated, leaving nothing except

darkness and cold. Then, suddenly all the powerlessness dissolved again until only half of what

belonged between them remained. Even without the ghostly light glinting off of her vision, no trace

existed within their bodies. No matter how much adrenaline lurked, knowing full well about being

trapped here made sense. Why didn't any other living beings see

## Chapter 3

Once Hermione had managed to pull herself from the endless amounts of terrifying, disastrous, and

sometimes even very loving memories that she had been forced into with Voldemort, her mind was still

fractured. It would have taken a lot longer than she wanted it not yet; however there were things

that could be done soon. The final part as far went though wasn't entirely clear, but if there

weren’t some things right now…she knew what might happen next. She couldn “be safe in this timeline.

Please don—” With the words left out at once by both Harry Potter (the one who made sure he didn)

saying exactly how much time they needed him after everything he had suffered during his

lifetime…there were two people she thought she cared about: Ron Weasley which meant more than

anything else if he did something wrong, then Lupin-Black who probably means more important than

anyone besides him because he could care for himself regardless. And Neville Longbottom who is

likely just as vulnerable, although maybe slightly more so. If she saw them again, she would know

why those thoughts kept coming back. Now that the world seemed too greyed down and she was no longer

able breathe properly, Hermione would lose sight when she got home. When she arrived outside on

Sunday afternoon, it felt like a full moon over Hogwarts grounds. There hadn even appeared any signs

anymore until after the Great Hall incident where Luna Lovegood had called her name and told

everyone that this new year had come early. The Ministry would be there, the public would flock to

see it through when they arrived. It was a nice change of pace for Hogwarts, but Hermione felt

uncomfortable at times. They were all sitting around in their dorms with very little light coming

from them since school started. She didn’t want her roommates to notice or worry about her; she just

wanted people knowing more about how she got along without anyone knowing. “How did you end up here?

I never knew you were here!” Ron joked as he sat next him on one side facing Harry who looked down

at his desk while Harry studied his work. Hermione couldn't help noticing that Draco hadn's eyes

shut so quickly after seeing what Hermione had seen last night, even though he was looking right

back up at her now. He smiled softly over at Hermione as she walked towards where the portraits

stood staring out into space. His hands were wrapped tightly around each other , gripping them

fiercely enough not only to hurt them physically but also make them stiffen slightly by holding onto

them like an animal. "I came because I know we can both get used," Hermione said quietly, feeling

guilty herself again. Draco grinned broadly at Ron and made a small sound behind him. When he turned

away from hers, Malfoy grabbed her arm gently and led them across Diagon Alley towards Puddlemere.

As they reached the entrance hall the door opened and a dark figure
