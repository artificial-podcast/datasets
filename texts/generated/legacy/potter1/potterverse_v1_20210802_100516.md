## Chapter 1

“I get it, Ron. But if you ever think mine and Fleur’s sex life is any of your business, just wait

until you see what I mean to say about ‘our time together'.” “Shut up.  And I don't want that

conversation happening again!‡ Harry demanded. Hermione rolled her eyes at him in exasperation

before pulling back with a frustrated sigh as she continued on without another word or response from

the blonde man who was looking so tired out there while watching them all warily whilst staring into

space like he couldn't breathe. Harry sighed and took a deep breath before going back inside his

house for more restful sleep which soon became difficult due their incessant activity within each

other's bedrooms. It wasn 'nightmare', though, and not only because they had slept around during

most nights but because Harry had been standing close by when Draco came home late one night after

dinner alone. He could hear Ron's breathing and his head felt fuzzy under stress, which meant he

wasn`t sure how long it would take for Draco finally return home. Maybe tomorrow morning? Or perhaps

this morning. If so… Well, maybe today didn... So much had changed since then. After spending three

nights in bed alone, Harry woke early Sunday afternoon and decided upon a place where Severus Snape

wouldn- There were no windows covering the room, so Harry decided against sleeping in those two

places anyway - even if it meant making Hermione shower herself with mudblood blood, she didn’t want

to be out in the cold again. She was too terrified of what this man was going into her mind and

seeing him on top made her head spin. “Oh, I see…” he said, turning his face towards Harry who could

barely contain his grin as Harry walked up behind her. He grabbed a fistful from Snape's shoulder

before pulling back once more and pinning the girl‘s hand over hers until they were pressed together

by Draco Malfoy standing between them all holding both hands beneath their chin at elbows; his mouth

twisted slightly so that one side appeared completely exposed. Hermione felt heat rise up inside of

her throat when Draco  pushed himself against hers, her own stomach twisting around the corner of

being crushed down by Severus‡ fingers. The sound caused an indescribable chill down the spine for a

moment, and Hermione realized how uncomfortable she must feel now. As the realization sunk in,

things started getting interesting for Hermione. Draco had gotten close enough to kiss Harry without

his nose touching her lips – but only because he was kissing her right there on Christmas Day. It

was not just about the way Voldemort kissed her or her family name: these were two other topics that

needed discussing tonight alone (or rather - after dinner) than looking like shite-faced teenagers

trying desperately hard NOT TO GET DUMBLED! That feeling of arousal peaked suddenly and

## Chapter 2

“I get it, Ron. But if you ever think mine and Fleur’s sex life is any of your business, I won't

hesitate to take care off that little piece by making sure she gets what she deserves before we

start seeing each other again…” ‘No! No no!‡ Draco snapped, pulling his wand out from the drawer on

top with a loud smack. It hit him square in the face, sending shudders down Voldemort's spine and

causing an explosion through the air like thunder so hard the room shook. The spell had gone

through, he was barely conscious at first but as soon her hands touched up against Harry or Ron both

felt hot wetness slide over their bodies. He gasped for breath when they were pulled back into one

another more than before; the feeling sent shivers across them and then settled around his wrists.

“Fuck… Fuck...fuck! I-I don— oh fuck Merlin,  Hermione moaned, ․I can‪t do this anymore…please… just

please come harder….  He lifted himself slightly above Harry and pressed his mouth flat against hers

again while keeping his eyes locked with Ginny watching them closely. She could feel herself

becoming tense all over again. His cock twitched involuntarily between two fingers and his head

darted forward slowly to try put a stop somewhere else where he could look directly at her. When

everything worked correctly and he finally came fully inside of her. She was breathing hard, but she

didn't move as much as he did. It felt so good and all the while his cock was inside hers again

feeling it. He kissed her head and then started to fuck her mouth off again. His tongue slid over

each wet spot on top with one hand and pulled out in a small whine that made him groan when he found

her entrance again after spending some time in there before going back to undoing the last button.

Hermione moaned loudly at how soft this new cunt had become under his thumb. Draco fucked harder now

just seeing her like this. Slowly he inserted his finger into every hole around her clit until he

reached the peak. This caused her body temperature up to a point where it hit triple digits. Once

they had both finished their sex noises from earlier, Harry moved forward looking down at them both

with a lustful look on his face and teasing his lips slightly underneath Hermione's earlobe. “Please

don’t stop me! I need to finish your round first mate pussy faster please sir. Please let me take

you deep enough for you to be able say yes once we are done. You can use my wand if you want me do

it master Potter.” Draco looked directly at Hermione. Her eyes were blazing with arousal; he knew

why she was doing what she wanted. Being given permission to make love to him wasn...anything short

term. In fact being

“I get it, Ron. But if you ever think mine and Fleur’s sex life is any of your business, I can”—she

kicked Ron off his feet in a fit that earned him an amused look from his Gryffindor friends as he

got up to leave— ‘take her down again. She  deserves the same treatment.  Hermione looked at Fleurs

again after they left. The brunette was looking worriedly at her while she thought about Fleus with

Harry over there who had been watching her closely this morning when it came time for them both back

together… ‡Hermione? Are you alright?‪ Blaise asked softly before turning around and leaving the

room. When Hermione turned away, her eyes were wide open and cold like ice on hot summer night, but

she gave Draco one last glance before going into hiding. As soon Bellatrix walked out without saying

a word, everything changed. They had gone through so much upheaval since their graduation day; the

Malfoy family name being thrown around by some people because none understood what they were doing

anymore than they did now... And then, not only would Draco be able find something to talk about,

and maybe even learn how very important love really could become…. Chapter 12: Unforgivable Chapter

Text †-what happened?  What have we done?!‭ Bill exclaimed angrily during dinner. “What has made you

come here? You said you wanted to be alone. I thought it was all a dream, but then you went into

cardiac arrest and died." "But that's not what he said," Hermione added bluntly; her voice cracked

when she tried again at this point in time where everything seemed unreal or unreal for her now… "He

told me the truth of your past without hesitation—" She stopped short as Draco reached out with his

hand; feeling like he had just entered an impossible situation. "I know things have changed between

us since we last met; there are still differences from before—there is still more than one person

involved, even if I'm certain we're closer now." He grasped her wrist tightly, "we will work on our

friendship until the day we die together." The words felt hollowly comforting compared against their

impending doom. Hermione sighed. Her fingers dug painfully into them. This couldn't be real. All

that she could do was curl up on top of him and hope someone would see her, let them see who she

really belonged next! "You can't expect me after this!" Harry cried through clenched teeth. “You’re

such an ass! You think I‘m going anywhere?!” Ron scolded angrily, tears rolling down his cheeks.

Malfoy pressed his hands tighter onto each side once more, trying desperately hard enough so no one

else noticed. His face twisted into worry, something that he hadns been plagued by ever since he
