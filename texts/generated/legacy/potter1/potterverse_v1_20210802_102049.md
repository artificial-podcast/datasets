## Chapter 1

"Shh," she murmurs, cupping my cheek with her free hand, "Let go. I've got you." Hermione's eyes

widen when we pull away from the wall and look at each other over our heads for a moment before both

of us break apart as they do so. We don't even see Harry again until about five minutes later, but

neither one are up yet. Chapter 37: A Nightmare on Halloween Summary: Prompt: “You’re right, it was

attempts his escape from prison after being captured by terrorists while trying out revenge on the

Deathly Hallows; however some issues have since become a bit more serious due solelyto their use

under the name of 'Draco'. “I know I'm making you a liar,” Hermione whispered as she took her hand

in hers and squeezed it harder. She felt his fingers travel up her neck to her jawline where they

found what looked like several scars. ‘Malfoy? Why is your face so red when he shows up?’ he asked

as his eyes narrowed at them all together looking down at him with tears streaming down his face

from being touched by Draco's touch before falling away into nothingness. He had been holding her

back for most years now but this was the first time that she had seen it on her face since last

night and despite the pain, she could tell that it wasn't real anymore. Her hands were shaking

slightly thinking about it while he wrapped one arm around herself and the other wrapped around her

waist. The moment she realized that Draco had moved closer she didnned an unreadable expression as

her chest heaved with exertion. It was hard not seeing the burn underneath her skin turning a deep

shade brown until she reached her breasts and began feeling goosebumps forming along each bump. His

hands slid across over the curve between breastbones and stroked them gently pulling her nipples

even closer. Slowly he moved again letting go slowly pushing against her flesh leaving no marks

there. Hermione let out a moan involuntarily wrapping her arms around Ron who was trying desperately

put himself in danger staring down upon Harry Potter

## Chapter 2

"Shh," she murmurs, cupping my cheek with her free hand, "Let go. I've got you." She strokes the

bridge of your nose and as I pull away from Draco's embrace she finds it too quiet to say anything

else at all other than: You're beautiful Hermione Granger and even though I have no idea why or how

much this feels, when I can feel every inch that is mine in this moment between us. She pulls me

into a hug, deep breaths heavy, then back out just wide enough for him not see what happened but

still letting me know he isn't going anywhere if he doesn’t tell anyone about this now. When I reach

his chest he leans against one shoulder so I lean down on either side, resting my forehead against

hers, holding my breath through each kiss until they are both asleep. “Do we really need any more

kisses?” I ask worriedly after almost an hour without kissing again. They hold hands before Severus

starts crying and taking off running towards breakfast. At first I thought Snape was the only one

who wanted hugs, but suddenly I realised I didnned him out during dinner hours because he was so

upset already and honestly I wasn't sure whether or less he had asked permission or needed them. But

maybe Lucius did give consent instead; perhaps it couldn be said that despite their bond they weren

'free'. So yes, I could try asking around another time…but right here would be some stupid way to

save the world." "I'm not going anywhere, Mr. Potter," Harry promised as he pulled her into his

arms. She let out a breath of relief when she felt something slam on him, but just then another wave

passed over their bodies and they fell back against one each in an instant before their entire body

was thrown around each other with great force once more causing them both gasping for air. Their

breaths were shallow as their eyes met, their lips parted slightly at what was happening between

Ron's legs as they began breathing heavily, trying desperately hard while Ron attempted valiantly

soothe himself. Both girls looked up at him curiously, and Hermione nodded solemnly telling them

everything that they needed information on how it happened. They all listened attentively, waiting

until they had heard enough to decide which way they wanted things from; if they did not want

things, where they could go now. It was clear to everyone within a few seconds that this wasn't

about the other side or any possible compromise though; there was no time to waste by simply

sticking together like normal people after such intense feelings had been building ever since they'd

entered Hogwarts. The next hour was spent running down corridors towards Hogsmeade knowing that even

without any assistance, someone else might have already started the trip through the castle gates

first thing tomorrow morning. When they reached Hogwarts Library, Harry found their dorms empty

except for Sirius who left earlier than usual heading straight

## Chapter 3

"Shh," she murmurs, cupping my cheek with her free hand, "Let go. I've got you." She says and I

don't want to leave again but at the same time I can't help it, so I pull away from his embrace,

shrugging slightly as he walks towards me. When we are both standing up in front of him Hermione

puts her head on mine and kisses me goodnight, “I love you” she whispers into our kiss before

pulling back a little bit because there is no way that will ever happen after this. After leaving

Scorpius alone Harry's out-dated behaviour has just escalated which makes things worse for us all

too soon. It isn' going well though since Draco has been really loud about what happened last night

Ron has finally come around and told everyone who knew where Malfoy was coming from how close they

were now. As if everything had gotten any better than expected then people started talking openly

amongst themselves instead much like their parents did during their first few years here Hogwarts

students start to talk more loudly when speaking freely or even under duress by others duelling

animals often being used as weapons against each other over and over without permission either side

having an agreement between them. The situation worsens once another person starts talking louder

causing panic to rise among those quieting down below completely unaware of anything happening while

also keeping most of the adults confused throughout their entire lives not knowing why exactly

someone else would be doing something such as looking hurt…..” Hermione sobbed. “I know, I just

wanted to see you back for a few minutes and then we could go home. Please… let me help

her...please….’ she begged quietly. When they finally got out of the house they were both dressed in

their best dressing gowns and moved into bed together so that it was dark outside. The door opened

behind them and there sat a naked Narcissa Malfoy with two huge black eyes, one red and half green

while another had white hair cut to give an oval shape to him almost like he looked normal from a

distance. She was wearing nothing but her own clothes; no knickers either after being told not by

anyone other than her husband that she would not come again. But when their clothes fell off

completely neither thought about how much time left before the night was over. Instead all three

stared at eachother silently and Lucius took her hand and kissed every inch gently as she pulled

herself up onto his lap as if waiting for someone who needed some privacy. He placed kisses on her

lips and whispered into hers: "Good girl" - "Hermione, what are you feeling? This is why you have

been avoiding me ever since your wedding day. You love my sister" Chapter 2 Notes – (See the end
