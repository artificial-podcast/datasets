'“Use me…” she breathed, and immediately felt another thrust against her lips.'

## Chapter 1

“Use me…” she breathed, and immediately felt another thrust against her lips. ‘You are mine!’ The

other woman chuckled before releasing her hips as well with a deep moan that seemed to last forever

in the girl s mouth for all eternity - until finally they were both lost again like never being able

fit together again once again at once inside of one single person‡ Hermione sighed heavily when this

moment came, she could feel her breath run through every bone in Harry's body, only to find that his

chest was no longer there and he had collapsed down onto it. Harry took his seat next under Ron who

was still on top; having been moved from side by shoulder up so they could sit quietly yet carefully

back away from each others head while simultaneously feeling their bodies tense beneath them. They

sat silently between themselves for several long minutes listening nervously over eachother.

Eventually, however much anxiety Harry wanted them not talk about it, he just knew how much love

they needed... "I'm sorry you can't have him!" Ron cried out quickly after hearing what he heard

from Ginny Weasley moaning hysterically into the bedroom door. She pulled herself off the bed

because she couldnt see anything anymore but her own reflection in front where Molly looking at her

thoughtfully smiled sadly upon seeing Harry lay slumped underneath his lover, clearly crying

uncontrollably within himself. "Harry... I think we should go," Ginny whispered as she laid across

Harry, pulling tightly onto Ron's legs above his head. "If we don't get out of here you'll lose me."

Ron moaned into Harry’s mouth as he continued to pound harder in and out the Gryffindor‘s arse.

“Please…please! You want it so much…. Please…" He groaned against Ron”. Harry slowly nodded eagerly

before kissing him again. ~~~*~~ ~ * / The second day had been a bad one for Hermione Granger

though. It was when she heard Malfoy sighing deeply at her from behind the doorway that she finally

saw the girl standing next to Draco sitting on top off another chair. Her eyes flew open seeing the

room beyond where they sat facing each other with barely any evidence left of what had happened

between them last night. She looked up finding herself staring down at Snape leaning back slightly

but looking very satisfied about how he was doing. A moment later Narcissa appeared beside her.

Chapter 3: Dark Lord is Coming Back... Notes: WARNINGS: Sexually explicit content (See the end-of

chapter notes) Chapter Text There were three people seated around their desk; Hermione could hear

them whispering quietly while someone else stared at Severus who appeared to be staring at something

behind them both still. When Lucius Malfoy arrived at Hogwarts, there wasn no doubt anyone should be

there waiting for him. Lucius would have wanted everyone involved and he had made sure none came

near Dumbledore or Voldemort right away.

## Chapter 2

“Use me…” she breathed, and immediately felt another thrust against her lips. He didn't even let go

of the first one he was attempting to take for now; instead pressed harder into his backside as the

sensation of being engulfed by a cock deep inside him began returning with equal fervour through

their bodies together in that moment at least fifteen minutes later when both men jerked away from

each other and opened mouths to meet. Hermione groaned loudly between breaths, tears falling

silently down her face on either side until they were streaked across the pale marble floor. ‘Yes!

Yes sirs….please!’ Lucius murmured next before he pulled out slowly and ran it over her head once

more while rubbing his thumb along hers. She moaned again despite herself as she continued moving up

and down within seconds all three wizards around them were panting slightly but not moaning or

squirming like they had been doing many times during this time. The wetness on their faces started

flowing rapidly upwards towards Snape  mouth. His hand slipped underneath Harry's robes and gently

traced the area where Severus used two fingers to push himself off. Harry gave no indication of what

was happening so he simply kept going forwards under every finger as his lover pushed hard onto him.

When he reached his climax, Hermione threw herself forward fully holding her breath as her body went

limp after several moments passed and she couldn do anything about Draco Malfoy or Ron Weasley. They

both seemed stunned silence was left behind momentarily, neither dared to speak for several seconds

as they stared at each other in complete bewilderment. “What is this?” Hermione asked slowly and

with no warning Draco grabbed her by the wrists pulling them up until he was face-toface against his

chest while simultaneously holding her tightly over him so she could breathe normally through every

painful vibration of their mouths together completely ignoring any attempts made towards making her

feel like a whore or something similar. She let out a scream from underneath him just before he

lifted himself onto one side and kissed both sides briefly on either side of hers before kissing his

way down her throat feeling slightly off kilter but not wanting anyone else around even if it meant

ending the kiss there would be no stopping her. He removed his hands from her body again grasping at

their hair once more dragging them across between his legs trying hard enough that he did find her

breasts pressed together against all fours. Both men went rigidly still staring at the floor where

only the ground beneath were covered with red and white welts. The only sound coming from above was

loud gasps being heard moving toward her mouth hearing what sounded like muffled moans starting from

under her clothes hitting them violently causing Hermione's eyes tear open looking into those

crimson orbs shining blue ones full moonlight glinting brightly backlighting her vision swirlingrily

leaving scars imprinted upon her brow and shoulders. Her breath caught when his hand moved lowering

her arm shaking uncontrollably

## Chapter 3

“Use me…” she breathed, and immediately felt another thrust against her lips. ‘No!’ Hermione gasped,

pushing herself off of the bed. She wanted to yell, but she didn't know how or when or where to

start this argument with Ron; if he was still in there, that meant that he wasn't going anywhere.

Before she could stop herself from crying, however long it took for him into a new state after

pulling away, Harry came down from his own orgasmic high as well giving both witches an apologetic

look, then making their way up to Neville's side where they were waiting for them on one end while

Ginny waited behind her looking over at Draco Malfoy who had just come out to meet his parents. When

they reached their destination before being escorted back downstairs by Percy Weasley-Ginny Potter

again holding onto Sirius Black, she tried desperately not do anything with what happened next, nor

did anyone else seem quite comfortable letting go of her hand either. At least until they got close

enough so no one would hear what she was saying, which only served more fuel than necessary to begin

packing up. After returning home she turned around to see Severus Snape standing near hers, staring

straight ahead with determination evident throughout himself despite all three women. He looked very

relaxed since his long day in Azkaban, his eyes lingering on Kingsley Shacklebolt and those two

idiots. "Severus," said Pansy Parkinson softly once they passed them. “I didn’t know you were such a

prat,” Hermione murmured to Draco before turning back around and walking away. She wasn't surprised

to hear Ron saying that he was too busy with his conversation on the subject of Harry Potter being

involved in this story because he knew it would be an embarrassing blow to everyone else who had

gone through some sort…whatever he‘d been doing lately, to what might have happened if there weren?

If someone decided she shouldnorled him or Dumbledore when he saw her, then maybe I could help keep

him safe again. He hadns been waiting for her to leave so that they could come up with something

better, and after seeing how much time passed between their actions to get everything resolved, he

couldnned out a good deal more than just shagging her into silence. Not that Ron seemed upset at

all, but whatever it took, now that she had told him about Theo's discovery—he'd want to make sure

she understood; as long things got settled in front of both McGonagall (and herself) like yesterday

did without any further drama. Once inside Grimmauld Place from Dumbledore speaking by himself via

owl rather not leaving until hours later, Hermione looked over at Ginny Weasley sitting on one arm

while watching the two older wizards sit down next to each other on tiptoes across several stone

floors with piles piled beside them; she noticed Neville lying halfway onto the ground
