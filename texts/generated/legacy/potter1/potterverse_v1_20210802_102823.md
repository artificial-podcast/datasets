'She wanted to touch the Death Eater with the newly released hand, wanted to feel her bare'

## Chapter 1

She wanted to touch the Death Eater with the newly released hand, wanted to feel her bare body

against his. She had always been a very good girl and he needed someone who could hold her down in

the most compromising ways possible as she slid herself up into him again without ever touching

herself. He took that as confirmation of what he already knew; he was going somewhere new if it

meant that Draco wasn't there for her next time around when they finally got back together. "I want

you," Hermione whispered harshly, pulling away from Harry's fingers as though considering doing

anything else. Draco pulled out of hers then followed after her and closed his eyes briefly before

nodding slowly, enjoying every second. After several minutes alone through their bond this last

night under Ron Weasley all thoughts turned fuzzy again until the very end. Even now as the night

wore on they could still be sure of one another’s mood. They were almost past curfew but soon enough

everyone would hear their cries coming from the other side of Voldemort Tower. It was late evening

and Severus Snape just lay curled up in bed. “What do we have? Where is Granger?" The dark-haired

boy asked as he stood near Lucius Malfoy watching over them. His brown eyes looked troubled and

uninterested in anyone but Severus himself however... He nodded quickly, looking at Narcissa softly.

Without waiting for an answer Lucius growled menacingly and entered Severus' room. Noticing what

happened Lucius found himself staring at Scorpius sleeping on top of him. "Oh, you're going to be

okay," Ron told his daughter as he watched her fall asleep in the crib next door so she could play

with their little boy. Hermione smiled and kissed her father's forehead softly before laying down

again. She hugged her mother tightly while she did the same for Harry."I'm glad that I finally got

this family together...but we have a lot more work ahead us than just getting married!" Hermione

asked happily after putting everything away from them. Her eyes went wide when she saw how much joy

was being felt by both parents sharing an affectionate home. It seemed like everyone had been there

too; they were all loving each other very dearly. The only one who hadn't been crying or doing

anything wrong about the situation was Daphne Greengrass, whom Harry knew well enough to have known

during sixth year. He didn’t want to leave Teddy alone until it became clear what happened between

the two. “We are friends now, Ronald! We should get along better? How can your mum make me feel any

less guilty if my dad is hurt?! You three made Daddy happy because you worked hard every day?!"

Hermione cried out then turned to Harry angrily. Chapter 22: Dinner Summary: Draco gets back into a

routine where he tries not eat breakfast (and hates eating), but eats dinner nonetheless. Notes -

A/N: Well..this chapter took way longer since last night, lol

## Chapter 2

She wanted to touch the Death Eater with the newly released hand, wanted to feel her bare skin

against his. He wasn't about as good a kisser as she was and Draco had spent all day kissing her

that night – even though he knew what she felt for him. Her lips were soft enough in their contact

that it was easy not notice they were touching. She also seemed less turned on by Lucius's actions

and more wanton when speaking of Draco; he was silent or waiting until her face came into view

before he did something he hadn’t said yet but he could still feel himself leaning forward from

behind Hermione holding onto one arm. “You need us tonight?” His voice carried with such conviction

that he nearly choked on another bite. Lucius chuckled as if pleased that she had agreed this time

around while simultaneously knowing he had to do whatever needed doing just now because neither man

would be able make it happen today. Hermione smirked at both men before pulling back swiftly after

taking a step towards them once again where there weren- Nevermind that Draco was already running

out first. Chapter 16: The Other Side Notes: I'm going through my notes right away! Just curious how

many chapters have been skipped over (and donations). They aren—well..  The next chapter is

scheduled sometime between these two epilogues so hopefully you're enjoying it too. If we can get

past that cliffhanger without ending up in trouble...but then again, who would want to go through

all this trouble?” “He said he wasn't worried about you,’ Hermione looked at him with a sad smile.

He just didn…well maybe not the way I thought he was supposed be doing it right now; but that

wasn—that was kind of his problem. So what do we have? We‘ll deal first thing tomorrow and they 

won-ooh! Then we�re going back to work after Hogwarts on Saturday night, so there�s no point in

worrying anymore. There‡d been enough research into Slytherin history to last me five years before I

could make up my mind for anything. In fact.  I should probably get back here early because I can

owl Ron soon as well, but perhaps if I wait until Monday morning I may need an appointment from

someone else. The rest is up to us though - both Malfoy's parents will be home by next week so

things don' really shift around, I�m sure. It‾s nice to see Harry awake too since Draco had been out

of town yesterday (his absence wouldn 'be problematic' except for when it happened). Anyways, good

luck and happy reading :) Chapter 11: A Long Term Continuum Summary:- Snape has been spying on

Hermione Granger during their relationship. She doesn   know how he got close to her..she knows

she's still hurt....but apparently whatever

## Chapter 3

She wanted to touch the Death Eater with the newly released hand, wanted to feel her bare flesh

against his. She wanted him inside of you - inside me. Draco kissed her and squeezed her clit

harder. He wanted it so much more than he felt ready for it at the moment; wanting that little taste

in his mouth when he took a deep breath, just knowing how good she tasted on his lips. “Let’s go

down this hall now…” Hermione whispered into Ron's ear as she rose from bed, pulling off her dress

robes before quickly walking out onto an empty corridor. The door swung open behind them as they

exited through their bedroom where there was nothing but grey-washed sheets. Harry stood frozen by

himself, staring at everything around them. His heart leaped every time they crossed paths and

wondered what had caused this to happen. Why did it have something like an end? What made this

happening? It looked like they were both trying too hard not to react. They walked back up towards

whatever dormitory room the Room Of Requirement had been assigned to so far away instead finding

themselves alone in one big dark hallway surrounded entirely upon its walls... But then their eyes

met again. One thing they knew very well was why it happened. And yet neither thought it mattered

anymore. Both knew this was another reason for hurting them so badly. For taking all they could get

while still being locked away in Malfoy Manor. Their heart began pounding furiously over each other

until it was almost vibrating. He moved his hand down to her cheek, brushing her hair away from the

mirror with a wet kiss on top of hers before continuing in an uncharacteristically seductive fashion

as he reached around and cupped her breasts once more between them together at their peak - but when

they parted lips formed into tight smiles that were completely devoid even by wizard standards,

Hermione’s mouth fell open for him without hesitation or hesitation! As if she couldn't take any

longer, the heat growing inside of Lucius's body hitched up along its length and Draco‘s breathing

became shallow and his eyes fluttered shut every time he saw her smile again; he could feel himself

getting closer and closer despite all odds and ends he had just chosen towards: the sight where

Snape came out of hiding after spending two years living in Knockturn Alley having no idea what to

do about it anymore - the feeling now being mutual and the fact this would be his last chance to see

her back? The one time alone he would have believed it wasnt possible, but knowing that while things

had changed since then, there still hadn- not been anything left of this little witch who never

seemed to care so much how much Granger was worth like Harry always did. “Ahh fuck me,” His voice

sounded far too forceful here, which made Draco chuckle loudly. Turning slightly, he continued

kissing her neck softly, fingers coming slowly through curls carefully
