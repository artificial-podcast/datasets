'“It’s alright, my good, little Mudblood. It will make this next part easier'

## Chapter 1

“It’s alright, my good, little Mudblood. It will make this next part easier for you to focus on the

first two things in your life. This is what I was fighting against when we were at Hogwarts: getting

a job and my family” ‘Because of you! It's not like I wasn't there too. We had no other choice but…‪

Hermione trailed off as she felt Harry  laugh once more. “I'm sorry mate-‡ She stopped herself

momentarily before meeting his eyes again with her own friend; this time in full view of everyone

else nearby who had followed them. They were all staring at him blankly as he continued talking

about their relationship whilst at dinner during lunch break. The silence that ensued between the

pair seemed so intimate they almost felt like a whole night. As much physical intimacy as it would

allow Draco Malfoy heretofore be involved - or even just friends – these moments filled with tension

and shared emotions around each member regardless if they were actual lovers playing a game of

hideously hot poker or someone trying desperately hard enough inside himself to pull away from

whatever was going wrong. He let out a low sigh breaking down into a sobbing sob while Hermione

stared down at Ron where tears still welled up onto hers. "We have to talk," said one male voice.

There weren only whispers coming from outside the castle entrance hall now. Draco narrowed his gaze

looking over the group, looking for any signs anyone else was missing. “I’m not here to search for

Harry Potter, I just wanted a moment of privacy—” She paused in her tracks as Ron pushed his chair

back into place and rolled onto his side, holding the boy by one arm. He shook his head slowly,

staring out the window at sea-level horizon with an expression that belied concern rather than fear

or embarrassment; he glanced up from where he stood beside Hermione while watching the moon rise

across its surface. Hermione felt a tremor roll through her core when she saw Tom sitting down next

to him on opposite ends waiting patiently before turning around and standing awkwardly behind a

table. "I don't know what happened," She said, pushing herself away so that she could still look

directly at Malfoy again without feeling like there were tears running freely down her face. She

continued her speechless exchange, glancing sideways once more before resuming her pacing. After

several minutes passed Ginny looked between them nervously until they were both breathing heavily.

They stared at each other briefly then Ginny shrugged. Before she spoke Hermione raised an eyebrow.

Her voice cracked slightly but it managed nothing to dispel the tension. When she came closer Draco

released her eyes and began speaking even louder, though Hermione knew better and gave him no small

amount thanks. Their lips parted only seconds later when their teeth clashed together causing the

air within Madam Lestrange's lungs crackling with smoke. The crowd sw

“It’s alright, my good, little Mudblood. It will make this next part easier for you to deal with

after today so I am sure we can work on it together.” She turned around, her eyes sparkling in the

light. ‘You are my girl and you are mine. You are going out on your own as soon or later without me

knowing. But right now, nothing matters. Nothing else is important except you!‡ she hissed, looking

down at him over their shared clothes which were lying on all four of them like they had been

holding each other tight since just a moment ago? Draco couldn't help but wonder what would happen

if he saw someone touching Hermione Granger again… If anyone touched her then no one was interested!

He wanted to keep that from happening – even though he knew how much Lily felt about it… No matter

who did contact her through those last few days, there wouldn' be any mention by the Ministry

regarding her activities tonight. All his thoughts were thrown aside when she opened up and said: "I

love you, Draco." Draco didn tuck the cloak off under his shirt; he hated being naked behind her

during sex and kept it tucked away underneath his robes ever since. 'We are always here,' Ron mused,

putting his hands on top-of himself to get rid already feeling tired. "But don not pretend," Ginny

smiled, patting him on both cheeks. They sat quietly listening intently while she watched the room

around them slowly warm and smooth, like an autumn's curtain that held her tightly in place as she

stared at it with wide eyes before falling into a sleep-like state. When they turned to look at each

other again for a moment Hermione noticed an odd spot on Harry’s face where he was standing just

below her. His shoulders were hunched over slightly too closely to his chest, but not enough so he

could feel his nerves. “What is wrong?” She asked quietly when Ron began speaking to him softly. She

knew how hard he wanted this conversation - he needed someone else who wasn't afraid of what she had

said. He didnned tight trousers under one arm and a loose sleeveless shirt underneath the other.

Hermione reached up close towards Snape without hesitating or looking away from herself. The cold

air brushed over his lips, making every breath hitch sound like pain; he looked down at himself

blankly, and she saw fear rushing through his features. Her heart jolted in equal measure, a rush

trying desperately against hers which made all four wizards' faces clench together. Ron looked

between their joined hands as if searching for something; even though he didnt see anything, the

realization that something might be wrong started running through him. Pulling back more than

necessary, he placed his hand on top (and then his fingers trailed across Ginny) next outstretched

finger and pressed a soft

## Chapter 3

“It’s alright, my good, little Mudblood. It will make this next part easier on you and your friends

if you let it go,” Tom returned gently to his chair as he sat back down. He rose from the table once

more, his hands clasping his heart. ‘Let us know what you think of our arrangement in the future. We

can discuss any topics we like?  As she continued speaking with Tom about her situation with Abraxas

Malfoy - including Hermione - Tom felt that something had changed inside him; there was no doubt at

all how important they were to each other.  As much as many of them hated Muggle-born witches and

wizards, others remained faithful loyalists to their old friend. They would not be swayed by fear or

anger for even a moment against another witch or wizard who had betrayed them – but then again…

these people wanted nothing else than war! To use spells such an unforgivable thing could do harm

when used upon someone without due process. The fact that Marlene was married to one William Weasley

made both parties feel hurtful because of every thought having been voiced over the years concerning

whether things should still exist between themselves and those two very similar men. She spoke

openly today regarding matters pertaining only herself: marriage – especially since magical marriage

is considered unnatural after death. Her words left Tom feeling truly sorry for himself, which just

added further fuel towards his grief. When Riddle entered the room shortly after he had returned,

Hermione felt as if she’d been hit by a falling stone and hadn't even managed to blink at what was

going on inside her head…at the very least it wasn “The Dark Lord” in there somewhere! She knew that

this must have taken place right before midnight, because for all of Narcissa's previous doubts

about what might be happening…she had no idea who would come up with such an elaborate plan or what

exactly it could mean. Her mind raced furiously through everything she had ever seen. The Death

Eaters were having sex? Or had they simply wanted something different? A Malfoy boy? Draco looked

equally confused, and then he realized—he really didn' think that night did anything except make him

feel better! He stood stiffly, shaking out his hands in surrender. She swallowed heavily, eyes

narrowing dangerously as she stared at them both silently from across space while slowly gathering

herself and moving back towards Tom once more; now, however...the tension was only growing. Chapter

like crackling fire, as though they'd sprung from nothing. It couldn--t stop flickering when they

turned sideways so quickly everyone lost sight behind its glow mark. They each made quick work

pushing against one another, trying not to fall forward into either other until their limbs shook

painfully beneath the onslaught but
