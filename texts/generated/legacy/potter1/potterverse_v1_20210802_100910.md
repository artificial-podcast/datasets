'“Shall we get you up to bed then?” Fleur asked, breaking role.'

## Chapter 1

“Shall we get you up to bed then?” Fleur asked, breaking role. Hermione nodded eagerly and laid down

next to her, folding into the fluffy blanket in front of them before pulling on a pair that she had

bought for the night. She was still wearing the blue one as it lay over their sleeping form. ‘I will

be there when I need my help,’ she told herself. The brunette would look forward now more than ever

to hear what happened with the Veela, and maybe just once every few hours or so. Notes: So this is

another chapter where I have been writing about veela magic and want some time to write something

personal! They are not going well together but they needed me to give these chapters an update...so

hopefully y'all enjoy :) Enjoy Chapter 4 Summary: Hermione has been looking around trying out new

spells since Sunday morning -and Luna took care after making sure everyone went through the usual

motions at school (even if Harry) —what do you think should happen tonight? Notes:- A little bit

prelude/pretext here from Katie who writes good-naturedly all day today 'Oh yeah, Kara said he's

finally got someone willing to take him back!' And yes, Draco did offer the Order his hand first

thing tomorrow…but why wouldn't anyone?! How does Ron know how much money Sirius has made off his

snake? Stay tuned....As always please leave reviews below :D Please check us while we're out!

Chapter Text ~~~* (SFW Prompt #9) “Hey,” Draco said with a small smile. He and Hermione started

walking down the hall towards Malfoy Manor in order to find her parents. It was just after 5:00am

when he heard the sound of their voices. They were sitting by his bedside, both thinking about what

they had been up all night. ‘What happened?’ she asked as if it were her life now that everything

had changed. Her father stood there in disbelief before looking at him over them like some kind of

freak show on television. His eyes felt raw from crying too many times but didn't bother trying not

look at himself and seeing his mother for the first time in almost three days anyway; he smiled

inwardly against something hard enough so no one would see. Harry and Ron could hear the tears

flowing freely off of his face even though it didnt feel right. There are few things less

embarrassing than having someone's heart broken because you know how much blood is going into your

veins every minute of every day. Lucius knew exactly who he should be thanking for this week, his

family's memories or whatever else Draco had planned for them once they were home. As soon however…

Draco looked away. The way the water felt around him made sense and reminded him why he was here. If

only he had known then what he would have done differently next year

## Chapter 2

“Shall we get you up to bed then?” Fleur asked, breaking role. ‘Fleur, I think it is best if we

sleep now-’ She was interrupted by the words that came from Bellatrix's lips. Her eyes had widened

slightly at this news and she stopped breathing for a moment before answering slowly: "Yes please."

Bellin looked down at her in horror and nodded. Hermione stared at herself as if waiting for

something else out of place on these two beautiful faces but when nothing came, just continued with

what they were doing under their beds so far apart that even though her heart almost beat normally

and with every waking thought hurt or fear she could feel like there would be no time to move past

it all. It was an easy thing right? But where was the courage to do such things?! How dare she not

see those little legs! They weren't afraid. They knew how to play nice without fear… That night,

after having sex too many times already, Hermione found it odd to wake up again feeling completely

normal despite the fact that she was sitting next to Bella, only one foot tucked into front beside

her chest. She turned her head away from them and kept her voice steady enough to leave no room for

argument. Bellini wasn taunting about what she'd done yet, but she couldnned her wand still pressing

against her skin hard enough making the muscles around her neck tighten and twitch in alarm; the

light of dawn coming through on the other side had faded to a dull grey. Hermione blinked, still

processing what she'd just heard but her eyes were fixed ahead as they fell upon Bellatrix Lestrange

who was standing directly before them, face as impassive and beautiful yet almost amused at being

laughed by a human being. "What are you doing here?" She asked, voice low. The brunette shook her

head quickly, leaning forward once more and lifting her chin with her hand gently brushing against

his chest, feeling the tight tension between their bodies rise even more. A gentle kiss from where

she stood right next him took her breath away, knowing that if she didn't continue it would be

nothing to him now… Instead he slowly drew back, letting loose a soft breath causing his mouth

harden slightly while allowing her lips wider for another kiss, this one taking place closer

together than ever before. He moaned softly when he felt the blonde's wetness slip into his pants

opening up like some sort animal skin. Her tongue slipped past his cheek and licked away at most

part whilst she held his gaze steady. After several seconds' hesitation Draco pulled out, bracing

himself fully so far behind her until he reached his peak. His balls were starting goosebumps along

each breastbone and he wanted to rub them off entirely without touching either member. But instead

did not allow himself enough time nor thought to do so or let her get comfortable around his cock.

## Chapter 3

“Shall we get you up to bed then?” Fleur asked, breaking role. “I don't want any more nightmares

until I wake up,’ Hermione replied in a deep voice and she placed her head on the pillow beside

Hermione as they both lay motionless. Fleurs turned around and looked at her curiously, it was only

after that did Hermione come back into her office. She had never been so tired of talking about what

happened with Fleu. The morning before her waking from dream at 5:00am approached. Hermione was

sitting in front looking at herself in one corner while another sat in close proximity to where

Fleveres were laying. Both women slowly rubbed their foreheads together trying not upset each other

or see anything but the coldness of Fleus's face. When they felt something hard coming off their

bodies they closed them out quickly before opening their eyes again. They saw an open door behind a

window leading to some sort magical barrier which gave them a glimpse inside that was almost too

dangerous for any human to enter. A few moments later there appeared two people standing outside

this wall of darkness. One stood tall with dark hair and thick eyebrows that fluttered lazily across

his skin, while he wore long black robes slung over him like gauzy masks. He held his wand tightly

in hand; even though Hermione could see that his eyes glittered from where his fingers grazed

against hers fiercely when he drew away to stare at those who knew what she had done. He didn’t want

them thinking she was a monster, that her mere presence made him feel pity and anger for his own

actions; it would only make it worse. She had hurt me more than anyone since I was an infant! Tom”

“I know… But you were young when I used magic. You saw through the darkness of time, saw my true

potential as much in your power over the future generations—but then you turned against yourself

because you wanted power again? Or did you just abandon all of your inner self-control with your

lustful neediness for power? Why do you think so little about Lord Voldemort? If there is one thing

you have learned from our time together, it has always been your love – your needy mind – which is

why we are both so drawn by it now…. Don't let me ever repeat myself or Harry Potter if you wish to

be remembered. The Dark Mark may never fade but even without its faded appearance, the scars remain

forever on our souls. It should not, however … ‘My Lord,‡ Hermione began softly after she left Draco

Malfoy's arms behind. As they entered their room Tom leaned into Padma beside his bedside table,

hands buried deep beneath her hips. His voice was calm, unafraid. ‪Hermione, can you really talk?

Let me help you down this path once andfor all?
