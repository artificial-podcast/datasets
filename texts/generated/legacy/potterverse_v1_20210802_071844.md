'Once Hermione had managed to pull herself from the endless amounts of terrifying, disastrous,'

## Chapter 1

Once Hermione had managed to pull herself from the endless amounts of terrifying, disastrous, and
overwhelming feelings that she could think about as a child. When she woke up at night, she found
herself surrounded by nothing but darkness in her wake; it was like being dragged into an alternate
universe where there wasn't time for anything. It didn’t feel real, because she had no idea how else
they would have arrived so soon after they had entered this world, or what they were capable Of
doing now. The day was already starting down with Draco Malfoy appearing before them on their way
home from Hogsmeade. He greeted everyone who came through, telling all he knew while whispering a
few words under his breath when most people hadn ‘dares asked' him. They followed him inside though
instead finding themselves in very different places, until they reached one another's room without
speaking much. There weren  any signs either side of each other in whatever direction they chose
within seconds once they got close enough - which meant they couldn tangle in another timeline if
not for Lavender getting too close. “Hello, little witch?” Ron said shyly toward Harry, before
finally pulling out something. She just barely recognized him right then and there. And suddenly
things changed. Just seeing him and looking at him made everything less awkward, more amazing than
normal... She thought back fond memories, recalling that they  had shared a kiss during dinner last
week. But first, the realization hit her like a bolt of lightning and she surged forward, kicking
off his clothes and tearing at Ron’s hair as he tried to catch his breath, “I know you were trying
not tell me—” He blinked rapidly and caught himself in mid-air before he managed an escape with both
hands inside him again: grabbing Harry by the chest and pulling them close together so that they
could stare at each other for several moments while their lips touched one another's eyes without
looking up from either kiss on top or bottom; then pushing down hard enough where Ron was panting
against Draco‘s shoulder, and forcing it into Lucius  mouth until he gasped in pleasure, swallowing
every drop of the liquid just falling onto Malfoy‡s cheek. ‘The point is…you are still mine! I can․t
take care if I leave this person behind forever.  Hermione watched through clenched teeth as Fleur
pulled away abruptly, dragging her fingers over Weasley‹ face and kissing him fiercely, giving only
a brief glance towards the redhead who looked back at her warily before lifting her chin slightly
and whispering softly in her ear when he finally spoke back: "I love you." With that thought brought
tears to Ginny‏ eyes, taking it all in, but also in vain, because she couldn't think straight
anymore. She had to get home right now. It wasno any surprise what happened next, no surprise at
all. Hermione had tried to reach out and cup her lips, but it didn't work. "No," she whispered into
his chest as if he were a child begging for affection from an older brother-in law who was currently
in Azkaban awaiting trial for his role on the killing curse that Voldemort used against him. He
didn’t even know how long she'd been clutching onto Draco's hand before they collapsed together in
front of them again; their eyes still closed, so close that only one of theirs could see through the
haze between tears when she finally broke away from Lucius' hold. She couldn “hold my son anymore! I
want you back!” There seemed little hope for love or forgiveness amongst those around Narcissa
Malfoy now despite everything that transpired after that night. And yet again something about
feeling helpless made her feel like nothingness ever truly existed. Her anger had never been
stronger than this since the day Dumbledore had saved her parents. It hadn—it certainly felt more
real because—she had always been able to feel things outside herself right then: free air, the peace
which existed within her heart, freedom of her mind, a sense where she could be anything without
fear taking over her life. Even though it terrified her, she had found relief inside to forgive it
by accepting the pain itself. Now though…now that there might have really not actually left a better
chance at happiness...she just wanted to be able talk to him without her mother talking about it.
Hermione was doing all the work, but she needed more time. She didn’t want Draco Malfoy making her
feel like this was his fault and that he was the one who had hurt her. He probably thought she was
in love with Narcissa because of how much she loved him; she saw that in Lucius too as well which
made sense. “I guess I don't know what you're supposed doin” Daphne said, picking up a pot of tea.
That could have been helpful. "You can pick me if my father says no." Harry chuckled along for now
so they were almost alone. Notes: Author's Note: Thank you again! Any feedback is greatly
appreciated on any chapters or ideas/suggestions i might make when writing your own story!! Chapter
52 - December 20th 1995 Draco left Bellatrix Black Manor looking like an ass after sitting through
some snogs from Ginny Weasley back at school (which ended with Ron getting caught). The two went
into their little house together, and during dinner, both Hermione Granger-Black came out and
thanked Draco for his help before leaving. They then got home from classes where they discussed
their relationship and the upcoming war (although nothing really changed until Mrs Lovett told them
everything exactly why Snape hadn't won yet.) As soon there would not only get a rise off by sharing
news between classes, there was no sign of a student or staff member. Even the sound effects were
not good enough to draw any students from their seats. It reminded Hermione that all her studies had
been spent at Hogwarts and she knew exactly what kind of lessons needed studying in order for her
grades increase so fast right now… "Miss Black," came Professor McGonagall's voice after several
minutes passed. The Headmaster looked up sharply with narrowed eyes, his face solemn and unreadable.
"I am sorry to interrupt, Miss Granger." He said shortly before continuing on his explanation about
missing class and detention. She sighed heavily as she gazed over at him but didn't answer. Instead
sat down next only slightly bowed towards Dumbledore when he placed an elbow under her shoulders
again then took off into another room. His eyes scanned over everyone present; some as well-known
members like Percy Weasley who seemed particularly interested in her work and others as lesser known
figures such’s Bill McKinnon (who spoke very little English) Fred Longbottom – Kingsley Shacklebolt
'old friend' Harry Potter? Dean Thomas?' Neville Nott – Death Eater Charlie Lee Jordan Jr! Ron
Yaxley … “Professor Riddle, I do wonder if you are aware of the upcoming assignment?" Albus asked
once they had left. Hermione nodded curtly despite herself. "…we will need your permission before we
begin," Minerva said, gesturing to where they would be headed until they reached their destination.
"I'll see you in a few minutes." He nodded and departed, leaving Hermione alone with Draco as he
took his leave of the castle while she went back to her bedside at Grimmauld Place for breakfast on
Sunday. It was late but it was one thing when someone had been attacked by a group that meant
nothing to him; he had no desire towards revenge against that person now more than ever before since
the attack. However this time there were still people around who were fighting over how much control
Potter and Weasley had regained from what happened during sixth year. This time, though… No. They
had gotten enough attention without even having any trouble leading up here. Instead instead
everyone went about making excuses or playing dumb jokes either way. Ron decided not so soon after
Harry had left for lunch because of all those things he knew could happen if he let himself believe
something he did not want to hear anymore: "No. I don't think anyone has actually given me an excuse
yet." Harry shrugged slightly thinking about all sorts again. When they came out into another hall
down the street, there wasn’t many houses like this other side which only made him feel better
knowing both Ron's parents were gone already. To keep the situation quiet, he stood outside looking
at most likely some kind old door somewhere in front them; ignoring the look of amusement directed
at his father once he noticed the looks of disgust across his face. Still, Draco didn’t think he
would be able to look away from them all for quite some time. He turned and walked out of Grimmauld
Place in a blur of movement and noise that made Hermione‘s knees buckle. She could hear him
muttering under her breath as she stood there staring at it blankly with no fear or surprise on how
determined she was not going after what they were doing. Chapter 8: The Long Kiss Notes: Thank you
so much!! I really hope everyone enjoyed this chapter! It's my biggest secret yet ;) Now, thank you
again Alpha/Beta readers who have reviews because i know many more chapters will come soon...
Enjoy!!! (See the end notes before reading.) Chapter Text Snow-Storm Gresham had been working
steadily since yesterday morning until dawn when an owl came flying through her window one
afternoon. “So?” said Dumbledore quietly. As if by magic Harry Potter had just Apparated into
Hogwarts today, as if waiting for something… unusual happened. McGonagall had never seen anything
like this. After all—it was a very rare occurrence. A wandless spell. It wasn't illegal but it still
felt like home anyway; so why the change now —Harry Potter hadn tamed it?! What exactly did he
need….  Hey, Ron Weasley. How are you feeling?  You should be back tomorrow - well, maybe later than
usual.‡ Ron

## Chapter 2

Once Hermione had managed to pull herself from the endless amounts of terrifying, disastrous, and
downright infuriating thoughts that had haunted her every waking moment since she had entered their
room. She had been so focused on trying not think about how to react to him, with all his hateful
looks at them like he was one big fucking fat kitty dog who needed no leash or anything else besides
a good old fashioned stickler for pain relief; that she hadn't realised that his eyes were
constantly scanning hers as if they didn’t have any time left before it faded and vanished back into
nothingness, then reappeared just as quickly in front of Draco's face when those same black orbs had
come back out again by way over and past both bodies. “What?” Her hands suddenly went slack, but he
continued staring at Ron where Harry almost fell off against an armchair. He closed his mouth
slightly, which gave Hermione some sort intellectual privacy. When Potter looked up at what seemed
likely Severus Snape wasn—how could he not notice that Lucius Malfoy himself remained hidden behind
two massive pillars? What was that supposed be doing to Granger?! And why did everyone seem
different? She was starting nervous too much to remember exactly what happened after she'd woken up
screaming under absolutely terrible duress! ‘Oh God,‡ Ginny Weasley screamed, tears welling through
her eyes as someone lifted her head, looking up. A smirk crossed Neville Longbottom-Black once more
as Arthur Tonks' daughter and the former Death Eater's son. Hermione is still seated by Bellatrix in
her mother’s arms, but she looks exhausted after a long hour of listening to the dark witch‘ talk
about Hogwarts with her husband, who has been absent from all night. It is not that he doesn't want
to get up too early for breakfast or drink tea; there are meals provided at the bar which takes him
just minutes to enjoy before he leaves. There were several conversations between Harry Potter
himself (his favorite wizard) along side Snape”—a topic many people had discussed within their own
heads since they learned how much Dumbledore knew his father was involved —and Minerva McGonagall.
The conversation came to an end when Hermione took another sip of coffee while sitting beside the
others. “Do you think Severus would like it? He told me I have a good friend named Ginny Weasley on
my staff…‡ The smile grew on both sides of hers, knowing exactly what she could possibly say if
asked this question. A few moments later Narcissa spoke up. "She also told us things we haven tabled
yet." Her voice sounded a bit strained so everyone around them saw Hermione sigh heavily. She felt
bad about the girl  comments, though she wouldnt let anyone know otherwise. However those words did
little to ease any pain Lucius Malfoy had placed upon him now regarding that morning during dinner
with Pansy Parkinson: "Are you sure?" “I think I’m ready,” she said after a moment. She glanced over
at the Slytherin table in front of them and Hermione felt her stomach flutter as if it were going to
explode. Her eyes landed on Draco again; he was leaning against his old chair next to him watching
her closely as they talked about their workday plans and then looking back at Snape. When Dumbledore
had finally met up with Granger, the two boys sat down opposite each other for a while before
nodding and moving slowly away from one another once more letting out a sigh of relief. In spite not
feeling any desire towards meeting up again, or even having expected to meet them together, she
decided later that it would be best if all three stayed behind and didn't bother asking questions
anyway, especially since Draco was so close by. ‘How are things between us?  Ron asked softly when
he saw Hermione approaching him outside Flourish & Blotts. He knew what was coming but couldn t
imagine how uncomfortable it was sitting around with her friends alone like this. Hermione could
tell that there was some tension growing among them because of Draco's reaction to Ron leaving the
library earlier than usual due only slightly…or perhaps Harry had been right—it was almost too much
to bear now. At least none Malfoy wanted to talk about it openly anymore, given how stupid it seemed
to many of those closest and most familiar with the group, but they all knew she was his. She could
feel her heart hammering in place as she tried not to clench around him again—not when he was so
close to tears now that some things had happened, which she would rather not be able to tell us
about later if it took longer than it already has? “I’m sorry, Hermione Granger-Riddle!” He cried,
shaking out his arm as though a rope was tugging at them from their hold on each other tightly
against one another's bodies for the second time that day. ‘Please don't give up your love! Don' we
know what you want right now?!  Draco was still shaking uncontrollably after this confrontation with
Potter. If he hadn taunted Riddle by using magic against them before, or even shown Harry exactly
why he thought it was necessary (and sometimes needed), then perhaps there would have been some sort
words exchanged between both sides once more, perhaps more meaningful conversation where they were
honest, like they truly meant everything in life to each others until the end came. But alas… no,
instead Ginny forced herself into action just moments ago, pulling Ron towards her side; holding him
steady while letting him keep his arms crossed over his chest despite himself being slightly taller
than him. The two women laughed together as they held eachother tighter, burying their mouths down
across either side apart. Neither of them seemed to notice the way his fingers twitched in her hair,
trying not even try and break free. "I can't stand him anymore." She sighed heavily as he leaned
over and kissed one shoulder gently before leaning back on it for a moment more; letting out a sigh
that could have been heard between breaths. Her heart skipped a beat when she felt something warm
and familiar against Hermione's chest at its center: Draco holding hands with Harry again while Ron
was kissing her right arm. The kiss was slow but intense enough they both felt the tension rising up
around them like molten hot lava spilling from beneath all layers until finally settling onto
Fleur's skin. It wasn’t long before they were panting loudly together under this sweet sensation
alone after being separated so close- A flash behind them caused the lioness' eyes slowly open. They
had taken cover beside each other too, and there are still dark spots along the edges where Ginny
tried desperately unsuccessfully harden her grip on herself. She began crying anew now, shaking
every muscle inside her body furiously as the tears came easily, though sometimes the release was
nearly unbearable. Fleurs lips were parted slightly once more then and by the time the brunette
finished the words completely dry off the blonde held her tightly tight. Their bodies shuddered
simultaneously into each others hands as they stared at eachother ever lovingly for several moments.
Finally a small movement caught hers eye and she broke away from his hold, crossing her arms over
the side of him as if seeking comfort. He lowered to one knee on either side; he rested his cheek
against it as well in case anyone else noticed. “What happened?” Hermione asked, looking up at Ron
who was watching them warily with an expression that matched Harry's own ever since they were eleven
years old when Sirius had sent Albus Dumbledore for their trial. She studied him for a few moments,
before turning her attention back towards Draco Malfoy instead—and not just because Riddle himself
would have been pleased to see her there. The look Granger gave him meant that she knew something
was wrong about her. But even so… It was obvious that this wasn't what she wanted anymore than
anything else. Not only did he keep asking questions but also he kept giving her reasons why she
should go into Azkaban after all. For some reason it made sense; without any other choice, she would
be imprisoned somewhere else or killed outright. And now, seeing that answer, Ron turned to face
her, one hand still holding onto both hands of theirs—but neither of those things seemed right. So
she leaned forward, kissing each shoulder blades lightly, as they lay side by Side, unable really
comprehend what Malfoy said behind closed doors. What exactly could Riddles possibly have told her
knowing she was innocent? Whatever Malfoy may think, whatever Hermione thought, perhaps Snape didn-
Not yet. “I suppose that’s what he‘d say if you wanted to stay here or not at all?” Hermione bit her
lip and let out a long sigh of relief when she felt the door open, startling them both in their
tracks as they sat back down on some plush couch cushions with no bedding. Draco sighed heavily into
his pillow so hard it rattled against each other's skin while Severus rubbed him gently over one
shoulder before kissing Malfoy  hand along its smooth curve once more.  …while still wearing an
expressionless mask. She leaned forward, making sure Lucius wasn't seeing any reason for concern. No
doubt there was a lot Voldemort would want from Granger; but also quite possibly two – Lucius
didn—not yet know how much time had passed since Sixth Year, even after having witnessed some
formative events in which people were still mourning. Her fingers grazed between Mummy lids again
then brushed against Locket glistening lips. The dark witch lifted herself up onto Harry who cradled
her head across Ron tightly on top where three sets fell together. They stared quietly off into
space, silence permeating everything around Riddle until only whispers could be heard amongst us
anymore than words. Hermione opened and closed her mouth ever second just to watch the eyes fill
with tears, knowing that this must have been something worse than anything else they‡ve experienced
thus far...but couldnt figure out

## Chapter 3

Once Hermione had managed to pull herself from the endless amounts of terrifying, disastrous, and
humiliating memories she’d been forced into, she was grateful for her own resilience. But even as he
closed his eyes, it left him strangely unsatisfied with himself; he felt as though he were lost in a
sea filled by despair that no matter how many times he tried desperately not to, he couldn't get
out. He couldn—hadn “get out…” Hermione swallowed thickly and looked away, leaving his thoughts
behind as they drifted back and forth between comfort or worry about what might happen next. She
knew she should have done something sooner rather than later, but she had no desire either way right
now anyway: the war was over! And if she wanted this world to be the way things were supposed go
forward again after the final battle, then so would Voldemort just die – there wasn-not-enough time
for that sorta thing like fighting another war at all – until she could do whatever she needed
without being judged by anyone else! Of course, knowing that Draco Malfoy didn -she hadnt intended
to use him against the Order when they'd both escaped prison during their fourth year, thinking that
Snape did it because they were too powerful, meant some great tragedy indeed, which was why it made
sense to her heart towards those who seemed intent on keeping her under control before they actually
got caught. It was also why she couldn'make love' Severus with anyone except herself, she was the
only one who didn't look scared. That night he kissed her forehead and nipped at his lip to keep
from biting. He couldn’t remember ever kissing a girl again. “I missed you, miss Granger- oh gods!
Oh God…don—oh God Severus...oh god, oh Merlin!” The sounds of moaning filled him, but his ears were
all muffled by those filthy tears on Hermione's cheeks; not wanting them louder or getting lost in
their own thoughts. And then she fell asleep again as if Harry had just said it out loud: "You are
so sweet." Malfoy rolled his eyes softly. At least he knew they werenned. She was still a virgin.
The room around hers went dark for no apparent reason after that incident in class. They both were
too tired now (she needed some rest) because Snape spent most nights sitting down next door when
Draco slept behind Lucius during meals like an exhausted ghost sometimes creeping into bed moments
before waking up. A strange thing happened while working on Transfiguration homework, which produced
absolutely nothing. It took several minutes until Minerva got back from lunch — even though this
time there wasnNo more work to do yet – where Professor McGonagall announced exactly what Dumbledore
would say about students being allowed outside without permission during Potions. With each passing
minute Weasley looked over nervously at Voldemort using Legilimency charms to determine his father.
By half past eleven, Draco had been at Hogwarts in the early hours of Sunday morning—two days before
curfew and two more than an hour after he had made it back to Grimmauld Place. He hadn’t slept a
wink or spoken for several minutes because if anything went wrong with that particular conversation
then she would find out immediately whether her mother was still alive; Lucius Malfoy wasn't even
here. “You may be aware I have no affiliation yet but we shall see about this soon enough as well…
let me get the details from your mother first.” Her lips pursed and then dropped into something
coldly sweet when Hermione looked up. She was wearing black robes, like one could expect of someone
who possessed a strong magical signature. A thick layer sat on top which reminded him quite strongly
what Narcissa wore during their time together outside prison: tight fitting, crisp white knickers,
deep blue cardigan with sheer black buttons, slippers and shoes. His stomach flipped at how thin
they were while also not fitting under her skin; a tiny amount over Nott's shoulders while hers fell
down slightly towards her hips. The older woman reached between them and placed kisses onto both
wrists, forcing him off balance once more. In the distance there appeared another dark-haired girl,
slightly taller than himself so much easier – surely she'd try everything without missing out too
badly? Draco didnned nothing but relief as she parted her lips gently, looking down at the baby in
her arms. The tears were all over her face and her hands squeezed hard, causing Draco to jump up
from his knees slightly, shaking Hermione’s hand when he saw her eyes widen a little. “You can cry
now, love! Please don't do anything so that you stop crying for me! I need you inside of us again!
Don…” A sob escaped Ron‘s throat but didn? ”Ron…I told you what I needed to hear; we are going back
to Hogwarts next year, okay?!‡ Draco whined softly, trying not to cry himself into an even more
disheveled state where he could feel Hermione clenching around him. She loved him – especially Harry
who seemed unperturbed by the idea right now with how completely it was. And just like that Severus
took hold on both their shoulders once more before grabbing them both quickly, grabbing out one arm
to help support himself while pulling off the other hand, and then lifting them onto each side of
Ginny's head, holding them tightly together. Ron cried loudly enough to make Hermione moan inwardly
after being crushed against him almost forcefully. As soon they had gotten comfortable and brought
their legs apart there lay only a small amount left between them so slowly, no matter how much time
passed within those few minutes, Hermione knew everything would be different if she hadnt been able
or unwilling come through that door immediately.” “I saw the signs of his condition, and I told him
to go back, but he stayed in my arms all night, as he was going about killing me. But it wasn't
until later that we found out what the hell happened after that." "And if you think there's anything
else I could have done differently?" Draco leaned against her side with a sigh—a sound so sad she
tried not look up at Malfoy over an eyeful from earlier; something so far away from normal when they
were both being dragged along by their emotions for days on end. He shook his head again. Hermione
felt as though his tears had touched her face. The way those words were so sharp she couldn just
stand still like this forever... Her throat tightened in embarrassment as Severus drew back sharply,
obviously trying hard enough without coming off too emotionally charged. His eyes softened slightly
under scrutiny before falling back into place behind hers once more: deep blue irises sparkling with
blood now reflecting watery reflection of moonlight. A few seconds passed before Snape pushed
himself closer. In a rush? She didn 'think' - yet… He closed the distance between them and turned
towards Lucius. They were still kneeling down together, her palms pressed against one arm while
Harry reached forward with another hand around Ron Weasley holding onto Luna Lovegood. Just then
moments ago no doubt someone would be talking amongst themselves. Their eyes met briefly, latching
upon each other tightly. “I’ll be right back.” She turned to face him once more and stepped away
from the door before he could react or stop her momentum—and then she reappeared with a smile of
utter delight in his eyes that stole over his features like dancing flames across glass shards as
they glided through the night air. And then it hit Draco in an instant where nothing had happened
but silence hung heavy on their faces, shadows casting their gaze forward until only darkness
remained beneath them all; eyes locked firmly shut at last for another long moment while Hermione
lifted her chin into either hand so close Lucius almost lost sight within seconds instead when
Narcissa's pale lips parted again, expression tensing even further along his shoulder as she began
kissing down both cheeks softly, one gentle stroke softening the curve between hers yet leaving no
visible trace behind. Then her teeth dug deep enough there was pressure inside Malfoy against every
bone-crushing inch making him harden slightly turning towards Tom‘s bedside table and leaning up
pressing his forehead against its ribbons. The sight made something cold slip out of his chest
forming around them both causing a gasp to shoot past his lips parting just barely brushing the top
of her head letting her hair fall free falling onto the mattress beside the headboard slowly sinking
lower now rising higher still settling atop his shoulders resting gently against her own chest
pinning her against himself. When she fell silent stepping closer and cupped her cheek gently
pulling back from his lips brushing over the curve of one ear, “What you want.” She smiled softly at
him as he pulled away slowly shoving himself out of sight letting her know that it was time to head
home Hermione blushed again feeling a bit embarrassed for not being able go on with things like this
without speaking up more than once before. She had always wanted to be around him after all. The
thought sent a thrill through her heart; knowing now could never hurt. It was what they were doing
right now. He was telling her about them and how he needed something different going forward but
didn't think there was anything else in the world other then family. "Oh? What?" she asked when she
got close enough hearing footsteps coming towards her front door. Just barely closing down inside
she looked surprised by the look Draco gave her standing beside her doorway looking almost as
shocked as she was seeing him just moments ago. Her eyes widened slightly giving him an amused smirk
tugging at those circles on her brows where their heads were resting against eachother's chests. How
did he do that?! Of course he knew why she would ask! "I don 't care' Granger." His voice came out
sounding unsure so she decided not even bothering asking any questions anymore hiding her face in
between trying harder to conceal her blush rising into its usual place. Not wanting anyone
overhearing her thoughts making her feel uneasy or
