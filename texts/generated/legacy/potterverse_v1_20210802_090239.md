'“Use me…” she breathed, and immediately felt another thrust against her lips.'

## Chapter 1

“Use me…” she breathed, and immediately felt another thrust against her lips. She moaned softly as
he moved inside of hers, her walls tightening around him so tightly that it took a few seconds
before their skin connected in what felt like an eternity; the moment she heard his own orgasm
washing over them both they were too aroused to speak, but not enough for Hermione any longer than
necessary after the feeling was so overwhelming she couldn't imagine how much more time passed
between each climaxes alone on either side until she found the right combination with no other
distractions. Draco pushed out slowly from within and kissed her again, this time harder now, almost
teasingly. Hermione closed her eyes and tried desperately hard at breaking her kiss, only able by
Harry's hand holding onto one shoulder to help her up when she came down off Ron’s lap. ‘Please
don!  Harry cried through clenched teeth. He began pumping into every vein in his body while pushing
back even further under the covers. With a sigh Harry let go gently and pulled himself free just
above his knees. They lay panting together quietly ever since then going back to playing games or
watching television whenever there wasnned to be a game show about Muggle films or talking with
someone who could talk without words. Finally Hermione got herself dressed and sat next wrapped
round Severus Snape in bed wearing nothing but black trousers and a white shirt. When Hermione had
gotten ready to open Lucius' boxers she carefully laid out everything and then pulled them off. She
looked at her reflection in the mirror, a happy smile on its face as it took shape around their eyes
together; there was so much she wanted to know, but after what they had done today Draco didn't want
that information any further than he already knew. He sat back down next Hermione placed all of his
clothes into one pile and placed each under him for support before moving onto Snape's belt loops.
"Draco," Severus whispered quietly, looking up from where he'd been kneeling beside Narcissa with no
hesitation between those legs when she brought her hand up over Harry’s, pulling him towards
himself. His cock clamped around hers and she could feel how wet it felt inside herself. How amazing
would this be if she wasn? Was it still alive enough now to keep him deep enough in her mind to do
the same for him? She couldn- This was going TO be SO MUCH better than the rest! Notes: Next - Aww,
I'm gonna break again Chapter 40 Disclaimer - Donate :) Enjoy!! (See the end notes below.) Chapter
Text “Good girl. You”—Fleur Delacour ~~~*~~~~ Once Hermione finished removing Ginny Weasley...she
was surprised by something else which was surprising to say first glance. Her husband seemed very
pleased about having his wife visit her flat since he had requested that Bellatrix get rid of her.
Although she had to admit, it would take a little time, especially now that she was here and the
Ministry had given up on her yet again!  She wanted someone who could see through her lies and never
let them go, like Harry Potter. Hermione felt all of her anger increase as much as her fear. It was
almost laughable when Bellitix bit down hard on Harry’s face so badly he didn't even seem to be able
move his eyes from hers at all. “No...no no, I don- I can” she suddenly stopped in front him with
her hands out, staring into cold, dead black orbs. Harry was silent for several seconds before
turning his head around quickly towards Draco Malfoy instead looking at Ron Weasley just behind him
(who looked more interested than ever) trying not show any emotion either way but also looking
Hermione straight squarely over the edge. Ron slowly shook his shoulders slightly then nodded weakly
while Harry slowly sat back against Lucius giving himself another small nod 'Do you really think we
should do this? Because surely there are things wrong with us.' Draco frowned sympathetically
pulling away by force, knowing what he was going about and being quite sure right now he'd rather
die tonight or whatever he thought he might do next. And if Hermione wasndalling anything else, she
knew why she hadn't been okay after last night. After making sure she stayed put, Narcissa ushered
her into one of the more comfortable rooms on either side. “The hallways are all paved and polished
for any sort’s sake as well but this is a bit dark with light coming from outside. The room has an
ensuite bathroom in which we can shower if need be, the fireplaces are everywhere so you won't have
to walk around naked or in chains- There will also storage space inside here because we want
everyone there to stay safe when they get home since it's our first day back at Hogwarts. As long
I'm not using my wand Hermione, you'll just be sleeping on your own again. Just remember that
everything is best left alone until next time!” Hermione smiled brightly at Narcophilia who sat down
beside them before leaning over to take a sip off another cup while resting on top form Géraldine.
Narcis had been completely shocked by the sudden change in the relationship between Tom Riddle – he
was nothing like his brother even though both were incredibly intelligent and brilliant, their
personalities equally matched – and himself; especially after what happened last night during dinner
where things escalated quickly. Even now, despite having spent nearly three years in Slytherin
House, under the impression that only Harry would learn about Grindelwald and his darker nature,
almost every word spoken within seconds could easily rankle him further than words found elsewhere
in his head. It seemed ridiculous then, thinking how little magic came from being raised away. "I
have to." Hermione says and she realises that it is not something her parents would approve of as a
child but so does Draco. A few minutes later Harry gets up then walks over to where Hermione's bag
is and the two he pulls out and stuffs them both into their own clothes and goes back to his dorm.
About an hour after they left for dinner when Remus hurries home Sirius heads straight downstairs
hoping that there will be no more food in this house before next week or any time soon at all
because even though everything has been going well Dad hasn't found anything yet which means another
horrible thing might happen! Chapter Text Even with what happened last night Albus knows exactly who
did these things...and if anyone can tell you about those deeds your father deserves just send him
here already; Severus Snape!! He thinks bitterly while sitting down across from his son on the sofa
looking around anxiously trying find answers regarding whatever could have happened....but nothing
comes to mind until tonight….he doesn’t know why Dumbledore didn ‘cause”? What kind were Lucius and
Narcissa guilty of doing…the man himself was far worse than either of those vile people…..when had
one person ever tried such cruel things?! Had someone done such evil actions by lying to others
again!!! But somehow none seem able come up with facts other than Lily James Potter whose body had
apparently become infected with a different virus only hours ago—which was a good thing. The second
night, they had been eating breakfast together and the morning after that Snape returned to his own
bedchamber where he discovered Ginny’s body still in her room from dinner at Grimmauld Place when
she woke up. He‘d woken then without seeing them again—and the next day, as usual there were no
signs of their continued absence, but Hermione noted two small signs in Draco's room: blood staining
across Harry Potter eyes; faint welts on him cheekbones while unconscious; bruises around what
appeared like fingers; red boils covering his lips (but not Draco himself); an ear-splitting cough
that did nothing more than leave reddish patches across his throat all over Malfoy Manor grounds for
several minutes, which made it seem less likely that Ron Weasley would have seen it. But maybe they
were trying? Apparently neither party had yet recovered enough information about how or why Harry
died to send out warning charms if one didn't return with Harry alive. There must be another way,
something vital. And Draco knew the answer before anyone else. “Hermione! Please stay right here!”
Voldemort  sent Severus flying into Diagon Alley, yelling, shooting off dozens stunners towards
everyone who looked down upon Death Eaters as soon began firing at each other through windows in
every direction so tightly rolled up that Crabbe tried narrowly catching the man just behind the
edge by using invisible barriers. “Go, you fucking slag!” Snape warned him as he emerged from
between them to go up against her walls and get closer before she started coming all over his chest
with each thrust of that huge cock in one hand while Draco took advantage again on top (the third
time was when they had both been so focused on their own head). He was sure he could hit back at any
moment if given the chance and she was a quick study for it; but now no matter how much Draco tried
not let himself get too close to either woman he couldn't keep an eye on her. When Harry reached
around Hermione's legs gave Ron an idea and pulled out of under her arsehole without hesitation.
They both groaned loudly after finding themselves once more entangled. Hermione began moving forward
until there were no more free hands or mouths left available to touch other than her thighs and
breasts. She moved even further down then stopped altogether and came right into contact almost
immediately with those soft lips of hers. Snape watched the scene play out first, watching what
happened next closely as well because his attention remained fixed upon Lucius who took this
opportunity very seriously. At least Bellatrix didn- She wouldn?t have to explain herself to him
about who ordered whom to fuck which way every single member within reach. It wasn--it certainly
would be easy enough to get away with torturing people simply based off blood status since muggles
weren?" Severus

## Chapter 2

“Use me…” she breathed, and immediately felt another thrust against her lips. She gasped and
shivered as he came inside of the woman. His tongue came in small bursts into hers, licking and
sucking at each moan that escaped from him to rest on his mouth instead whilst keeping himself
buried deep within those lovely breasts where Hermione had been able touch them so lovingly all
evening long before this morning; feeling the feel between their bodies pressing together like a
tender band around one's hand. ‘Would you look?’ He asked, leaning closer to kiss them. "Please,"
Hermione said firmly through moans begging him for more. The heady sensation that was coming made it
easier than it would have ever done if they were playing with blood or magic. He leaned back further
placing his forehead against theirs while letting out a soft moan when he remembered how close these
two were. Her own eyes widened again seeing that he was touching them both intimately. It was almost
enough now that the heat between his legs melted away completely leaving just the flesh there alone.
After what seemed like an eternity, Draco reached down and slid over her thighs roughly kissing them
apart. Hermione knew exactly who loved whom today and still did not seem uncomfortable about telling
anyone right then. When he finally pulled off of her shirt, her breath hitched slightly hearing him
groan underneath her. They fell onto bed next having already spent some time together during
breakfast after dinner where Harry tried very hard but failed miserably. She was glad that the book
had been discarded on a shelf, but didn’t know if she should expect to read it again or not. It
wasn't long before Hermione got her hands up and placed them on top of each other in an attempt at
calming down their tension; trying out something else for him, such as comforting himself, she said
quietly: "Maybe you're right." His eyes darkened, his gaze quickly falling upon hers with
determination… "I'm sorry," he whispered into one hand so close they were almost touching. He held
her against herself until she felt him moving towards her. Her heart broke painfully when she
realized what his mouth would be next because it hurt like hell. Instead – her mind raced,
desperately searching to understand what he was doing to her and then once she saw what exactly she
was looking back onto could only make her shriek. “Hermione! Are you okay?” Blaise asked, getting
closer to him. Hermione swallowed hard, and looked around frantically, finding the door closed
behind them both by now too narrow for anything to open without knocking. As she reached inside she
found Draco standing there watching them with wide eyes waiting impatiently for her reaction, while
Bellatrix wrapped her arms around Ron's waist and took a deep breath. Then Hermione found Harry
coming nearer still. The blonde looked between them. There appeared someone standing nearby, who had
a small, thin-framed cabin on the grounds. They sat in silence for several hours, and finally they
came to an agreement. "I know that you've been thinking about me all day," she said slowly as
Hermione and Ron moved closer together with their hands clasping tightly around each other's
shoulders again; Ron was clearly apprehensive at this moment, but he nodded quickly before
continuing his discussion of what she'd told him privately. Draco felt his own heart sink into
himself by how her confession made it seem like she was just letting him go—not wanting them there,
not wanting more than any possible reason for his actions. He could tell she wanted this, that she
had listened closely enough over those few months to hear everything that lay ahead from all sides:
his thoughts were always the same things, yet so much of it fell outside either direction. It would
be foolish if she hadn't given the truth sooner or later; neither of them seemed willing take up
such conversations seriously anymore without a fight. After another hour spent in silent
conversation (which wasn’t even half as long as Harry had insisted it should), both Hermione Granger
gave way once more to give voice now only because he asked why she didn “want us here” instead… and
then she looked back at Ginny Weasley and asked, ‘What are we going do?‘ Ron had begun explaining
some ideas behind something else, as he continued unblocking the door between themselves and Bella.
"Why?" asked Bella, causing Hermione to pull back from her hiding spot as she did so with a sudden
burst of pent aggression. A look on Bella's face told everything she needed in order for Bellatrix
not only succeed but thrive in the long run. The redhead looked down at his lover for a few seconds
before replying, moving out of the room into an alleyway that was now deserted by the security guard
who was waiting for them. She stood up quickly when someone walked through the doorway leading
towards him again looking around nervously. Bella took a deep breath trying desperately all she
could to ignore the curious stares coming from the crowd surrounding her. “I see you had better go
get dressed then I will kill this idiot!” He growled over his shoulder grabbing hold behind her neck
pulling her close allowing him one last kiss on top there being no point in talking about it right
now. After their encounter they finally broke apart laughing while Hermione felt herself drift off
the edge of whatever was going be happening within her head. When she came along the first thing she
noticed was Harry sitting slumped against the desk opposite her holding onto Ron tightly watching
him intently. It was obvious how much guilt she had been feeling inside due never letting anything
happen other than Harry's disappearance like that alone brought tears to my eyes briefly. Then she
remembered what she'd seen earlier; the way he had said those things made her feel sick. There was
no doubt that they were trying to keep Hermione away from him, but not completely out of fear she
wouldn’t be able escape them as soon he disappeared. Severus just shook his head and pulled back on
the fabric with one hand before he walked over slowly towards Draco's room; it looked like an
abandoned church, except for a door leading to another floor. “I think we can find you if anything
happens…it seems…impossible...but I suppose it”—he gestured toward where Potter would sleep—and then
pushed himself up against something hard enough so Snape could hear what she heard. She moved in
closer as well because he had been so close without touching her, even though their lips connected.
He breathed deeply into Harry again, feeling the warmth of each other and knowing that he was
finally getting used within her. When he felt that Harry wasn't there, or that maybe this only meant
she was alone in some way when he came, all thoughts about how stupid they must have become
disappeared with a whisper: "Harry will be fine," which he didnned harshly at once. Harry gave him
more care than necessary, and he moved faster now, coming after her right behind him. His hands had
wandered down under her knickers underneath robes, past between buttons of hers beneath dress robes;
pushing gently until her breasts brushed against skin and clothing. It took every ounce left in his
body forcefully moving forward while her hips rigid. He held himself with one hand, holding the
potion up for her to take as she was ready. She placed a small kiss on top of it, causing him and
Lucius both heaving breaths that were soon forgotten. “I love you,” Hermione whispered against
Harry's lips before she finished her sentence. The only thing that kept her from falling asleep at
all at night was being Malfoy watching her come undone under Snape completely unannounced. Chapter
12: Notes: (See the end notes after the chapter Text Draco POV The next morning, Hermione woke up
early and dressed in nothing but an overly loose dress shirt and stockings. It had been two weeks
since they had taken over their post office and since then things seemed normal. Even though there
hadn't really even happened anything between them, neither could tell if something was wrong or not;
it felt like they were living together again, which made sense given how busy other people worked
this week would be once they got back to school. Narcissa Malfoy hadnned some pretty extravagant
gifts last weekend when Blaise and Theo arrived home by owl so he didn...well, stayed away until
dinner. His father took another look around the house during breakfast and realized what she had
done—she was actually trying hard enough now getting herself comfortable. "Oh," Draco frowned. That
must have just about ruined everything. After having spent most Saturday night at Grimmauld Place
alone relaxing down beside her bed, her eyes never leaving his. He had been feeling the same way for
weeks now and he was only just starting to realize that something else was going on with him. There
were several times in particular during their conversation that he felt like they were being
compared against each other, but it was clear that these two were different people. The more one
tried arguing or trying new things together until there wasn’t a fight, of course this was not the
case. But if he pushed aside those feelings within himself for the sake simply because they weren't
enough anymore, then what would he do? Grow old and change into someone who could be better than
them? And once again Lucius Malfoy knew exactly how much Ron needed thinking about when Harry came
over so he did his best effort as well; Ron was getting older by the day so Severus didn “go back
home for Christmas…I want to know everything you have ever wanted from me. I want your heart, my
soul. Even if I donned pajamas today." She leaned up close to kiss Draco's cheek before she left and
said nothing more. When Hermione returned, Snape felt almost sickly pale and cold. It took all four
wizards ten seconds (or less) between turning around after seeing both Slytherins leave—and walking
out—to walk back inside. Lucius stood stiffly staring at Potter as though waiting for an answer but
instead found herself leaning forward in front

## Chapter 3

“Use me…” she breathed, and immediately felt another thrust against her lips. She bit her lip and
couldn't help but moan into his mouth as he did so without speaking. He slowly pushed himself up on
the bed next to Hermione until they were lying face down on either side of each other again in a
comfortable position that was so close together it felt like she could breathe on him as well -
almost. The next moment Harry grabbed hold onto one arm of hers trying not to cry out when Draco
slid back around, pulling them both closer towards Ron who now stood just behind her. ‘Draco...I
love you!’ Ron cried with a loud whimper, still looking at him with wide eyes. Hermione whined
softly under their breath over how much better this felt than before. There had been some slight
pain from her hands being tangled in Bellatrix's hair since last night, however it wasn't all bad.
It could have hurt more if he hadn 'wetted herself off', which would have affected her greatly for a
variety reasons. When Ron started to move away from him Hermione realised that she needed someone to
care about. And maybe it was time for something else. Something personal. One of those few moments
where Draco had allowed her body too many choice choices. Maybe because that day had given her
enough choice? They had stayed quiet during most conversations, but after several minutes of silence
Ron began tauntingly taking matters into account. His words were spoken at length, but she felt her
anger rise as she knew what he was going to say. It wasn’t his fault that Severus had been caught.
No one could have known. She wanted no part of it and so did Harry—and she was disappointed that
they weren't able convince the Headmaster not just yet another witch who didn “care” about her. But
Hermione was determined now if there would be any change in him, and she vowed herself soon enough
for such a future possibility presented itself when Lucius gave Snape an ultimatum. Not only would
Potter accept this marriage contract but also give up control over all of Hogwarts and everything at
stake because Draco Malfoy wasn'r supposed take charge? If anyone should commandeer power from a
professor like Malfoy, they'd do it right away; and without doubt, he wouldn- He sat back with
slight disappointment on top ole Miss Granger's shoulders while trying desperately hard get her to
acknowledge the fact exactly why a man like Riddle couldn... ~~~*~~~~ Once again… Pansy Parkinson
was sitting next to Bellatrix Black. The younger girl was holding hands with Dumbledore‘s son Nott,
both clad neatly dressed by their former Death Eater master, whom Lupin had asked to meet them after
the holidays. With eyes wide open within themselves before flickering to each other with something
akin excitement. Minerva McGonagall was standing near beside Professor Slughorn, smiling widely. “I
have invited you to sit with me this evening for lunch.” She spoke up when Hermione’s eyes shot back
to Harry and Ron who were watching the two of them from their seats. At least she knew they had a
seat right now; if they didn't then they wouldn at least know that it would be best for her not
having any more guests than she did in the Great Hall. Once again Bellatrix was right about sitting
next door by Pansy Parkinson. She turned towards Neville so he could take his place on either side
where she sat opposite Harry which was a bit awkward as she thought how long she had been lying
there over there while she watched the three other girls play Quidditch. A few minutes later, Harry
came down from Hogsmeade after saying goodbye to everyone else. He wanted nothing better than hear
what happened between the four boys but before he got too close, he felt something was wrong. All
four Gryffindors glanced around at each others' faces nervously before turning to look at him, just
like he said he wasn- That suddenly seemed almost outdone itself. The entire castle fell silent once
or twice due to Voldemort causing the small crowd within Hogwarts - even smaller ones - across
England's border all together trying desperately hard get rid off one another as their own students
huddled behind the Headmaster waiting patiently. When Harry finally made his way through the door
and out of Professor McGonagall's office, she stood up from her chair and took a step back. "I'm
glad to see you've found your place." She said, making sure there was no confusion in it's tone. A
few minutes later Mrs Weasley and Hermione walked into Minerva Manor. Hermione had just seen
Dumbledore leave when he spoke softly to Ron during breakfast, "You look fine today." He said with a
soft smile before looking at Bellatrix who looked like herself again for the second time that day as
well; but never as she felt inclined or prepared to answer. She opened one eye to ask why someone
would bother to meet her so early this morning, but then shot up, choosing instead not begrudge him
if he did. The fact that she knew how much they were friends told her something about Ron being
somewhat upset by her relationship issues, more than anything else though— especially since
Voldemort had been around all those years. Her eyes darkened considerably once she thought about
what Malfoy had done after he'd asked them to help find a way into their home. Not wanting anyone
seeing them, however… But right now there wasn't any use in doing anything anyway. As she rose from
where she sat on top bookshelves next towards Pansy Parkinson headed straight towards Snape’s
classroom. “Come sit down Miss Granger. I want both us here to discuss our case regarding Mr
Potter.” “What are you going on about?’ Daphne asked, her voice quiet as she stood up straight and
walked towards the desk. Harry looked at them before taking a deep breath in through his nose for
several moments then he said: "I don't know if I can be bothered with this kind of thing anymore.
But there is an incident that happened today when we were talking." Hermione nodded, but didnt look
away from him. He narrowed his eyes at Lilly who was staring at Draco with wide eyes. She stared
back at Neville where they both looked surprised by Draco's outburst. Draco gave another short
chuckle, though not quite enough so fast to cause her discomfort. Dippet chuckled again, saying
quietly: Dear friends! This was your suggestion too, it will help me settle this matter later;
however...you won- you've made good progress while dealing out all these issues between yourselves.
Please take care of yourself tonight, alright?" It was clear that Dipping wasn'ing hard yet, and
Harry had found that he liked being challenged around Snape or Malfoy like a dog during their last
Quidditch match together – which caused a bit more tension amongst the two than usual. When everyone
was gathered inside Hogwarts grounds for breakfast, Harry sat down next to Theo, then Dippy joined
him over the side. After dinner Ginny got up early after Dumpster break to get some work done since
most students wouldn’t want anything to do with her, but I did my best.” “So you know what‘s a
surprise for me? A little something that will keep her happy and healthy while at school! ‡ Blaise
laughed as he grabbed his friends handbag and took off from the house. Draco felt so bad about
leaving him behind in the Great Hall when he had spent all of Saturday worrying over Hermione 
relationship again now being with Hermione Granger. He was really glad it wasn't just because he
knew this year would be different than last time. They were both completely together. And even if
they didnned nothing for each other, their friendship had been there for years now; more important
than ever. It made sense why Theo and Harry needed eachother too. The fact that they wanted to spend
holidays together meant that everyone else was welcome back here without any worry over the fallout
after graduation. But then—when she asked how many people still loved her through Christmas already
-they couldn probably decide whether or not things could have been better on another day. She hadn
taunted them enough during first year, though. Her words came out soft like an angel as she looked
down at herself in front of Neville Longbottom who stood next to her with serious expressions on his
face, looking between Blanche Lovegood (who by the way seemed almost amused) where Daphne Greengrass
also sat next to her. “I’m so sorry, mate… I don't know how you survived this day alone in that bed.
That was a long time ago.” Hermione blinked, tears welling in her eyes. He looked up at his wife and
smiled. The smile was the same as when he first kissed her back during their last year of school; it
felt like sunshine being poured over them both for warmth instead what they had just been doing
together. She could feel the heat rising on her cheeks but she couldn only hold onto his touch with
one hand. It wasn't until after the kiss that she realised exactly why he was smiling. When Tom came
home from Azkaban, Hermione was not expecting him anyway because all night, she wished she could
have gone see Narcissa if that would have affected everything in particular about Draco Malfoy - but
then again maybe something more than that wouldn 'take away.' And suddenly, there were thoughts of
Draco coming into their room every morning or even two mornings knowing full well who else was out
there looking through their wards. There seemed little chance of anyone seeing Lucius Malfoy's face
right now except for him. But no matter how much she tried valiantly trying make contact with Harry
Potter – despite everything else around her — nothing happened. No one ever said anything. Nothing.
Just stared into space. Hermione hadn-never felt any warmth emanating from either man before – which
made sense considering the
