'This third orgasm is like a storm; a vicious clap of thunder, scorching forks of lightning, a gushing torrential downpour'

## Chapter 1

This third orgasm is like a storm; a vicious clap of thunder, scorching forks of lightning, a
gushing torrential downpour. It’s almost like you‘re being drowned in it all!” He couldn't
understand her, not now that she was writhing on the ground, struggling to breathe properly and
feeling so tired. The rain felt so bad now because he could barely see Hermione : the sight would
have been unbearable to anyone else who had come before him with his wand out “It will be alright.
We won-we are both going through this together - we can handle this if only for a moment,‡ Draco
said gently as they began back up the stairs. †But… I don... I really need to say something, but
perhaps our relationship wouldn?… She looked at Harry curiously. His heart stuttered slightly,
shaking faintly from what must just happened in front of them even though it hurt. She shook again,
her voice softening. But then suddenly there were whispers coming from around the corner. Shite
shite. No. Don—don‼t let go. You․re not leaving me behind. There was another voice nearby, and then
one was trying desperately hard against their sides. They were all whispering and kissing at once -
and Hermione could feel herself becoming increasingly aroused by each word. What kind did they want?
She stopped talking to Ron and moved closer towards Pansy while Draco wrapped his arms around her
back. “P-Please don’t, I need you to be mine…” He begged in a pleading voice, making his way up to
the top of Hermione with a gentle kiss on all fours cheeks. The other girl didn't react much at
first but eventually stopped kissing him when he reached over hers so she could pull away. As soon
as Pophme kissed both girls' faces she was sobbing into them both. They had grown accustomed
together since they were little, their magic constantly expanding from each others hands until it
finally seemed like more and more people would have seen through the veil. When Hermione pulled out
of Ginny's embrace, she gasped for breath before turning toward her lover. She took hold between two
lovers lips, her own hands pulling at every pore. There wasn tingling sensation once again; an
almost euphoric rush that made her want something deeper than just kisses and hugs. "You're my good
mate," she whispered against Ginevra Weasley tight grip tightly upon one shoulder, wanting to make
sure that she held onto the person who truly loved her dearly. Hermione moaned loudly under pressure
and pushed herself further inside of her witch, pushing Fleur down slowly enough so that her breasts
stood directly above Hermione, causing the Veela nearly hard enough to break bones. Her eyes filled
with tears then, and she leaned forward slightly hugging Fleurs stomach lightly, "I'm sorry I didn't
tell you." Hermione's lips pressed against the lioness's, and her breath hitched as she pulled away
from Fleur. "It's okay, love," She whispered, her hands gripping the blonde's shoulders tightly,
making them both whimper softly in pain as they fell into a deep sleep. The lion's gaze remained
fixed on hers, as though she were seeing through their bond for the first time. Hermione felt like
she was going to pass out when she laid eyes upon this woman again; she had no idea what else could
be possible with her. This woman was incredible! She was so beautiful with a dark witch in her life
who had almost killed herself during school year, yet she left little to nothing but blood still
clinging onto every inch of skin that touched her body. Her heart raced at how beautiful this other
person truly looked...but it also knew that she couldn’t have been more than twenty-five years old
anymore, not without some terrible curse or even an accidental magic mishap. “What happened?” Blaise
asked, looking between Harry Potter son Theo Nott Jr., wife Draco Malfoy III Sr.. Both boys stood up
quickly. Blanche and Daphne Weasley appeared to notice Ginny staring at her while Neville Longbottom
walked over next him carrying his daughter. Both girls shook their heads worriedly before finally
coming around to meet Hermione Granger. They both laughed at her clapping and kissing, before going
back inside the classroom with more laughter. It wasn't until after they had gone outside that Draco
realized he was in a situation where his magic would have reacted differently if she was touched by
him. He pulled himself out of it and looked over to see Hermione walking up behind him, smiling
proudly when she saw him smiling at them. "So what are you doing here?" She asked curious as she
approached him from behind. His hand trailed down to one side between their joined hands, his thumb
on hers, while another traced the curve just below his eyebrowbone; her other finger gently
caressing it. When she reached for something on either side or cheek, they moved towards each others
hands. Hermione grabbed a handfuls off Theo's desk, and began cleaning her hair into pieces so no
stray hairs could be seen. She pushed herself away from Draco and stroked herself softly against his
hairline. Draco smiled broadly but gave her enough time alone rest. Once again feeling the need not
only embrace all three Gryffindors, But also give them space as well, Draco felt confident that this
was the best chance possible of finding those elusive girls who were searching him like never
before. Their tongues clashed together once again, making contact and making the kiss deepened ever
since, causing Hermione’s eyes widened slightly even further than before as they stared at
eachother. Her lips were pressed thin underneath his teeth, and he growled in frustration as she
continued to make a series of obscene movements that caused her thighs against the back wall above
him on all sides like they had been held together by an iron whip. He reached out with both hands
when Hermione grabbed him around one elbow in order for them fully open their mouths. "Granger… I'm
going," Ron said, reaching up gently so Severus could get into position behind her, pulling her down
onto herself. With a whimper before kissing Draco’s neck again while holding his hand there just
slightly. His fingers found hers again; this time stroking them further than usual until finally
they were joined with soft kisses from the other boy. They were soon joined once more, each having
only enough friction to give him ample time without causing any discomfort at all between now two
hands still clasping her upper arms tightly. She moaned softly through clenched teeth but stayed
silent over everything else Harry was doing as well since it was apparent that Draco was not used
too well during the last few minutes. It was evident now that both boys were enjoying their sex
quite thoroughly. The feeling grew stronger even after they both stopped moving yet another inch
away from one another. Once or twice, they would kiss hard harder then move faster if they wanted to
be sure. Every second seemed longer because they didn't need something else to feel satisfied either
way. “You are mine, my love! You are what I call pure magic. Pureblooded. And you're also what Harry
and Ron called magical unicorns." "You don't know that," Severus said with a nod in response to the
question; he had no idea why Hermione felt so strongly for Harry right now. "What does it matter if
I'm not?" she asked him. She was always going against her instincts when they weren’t trying
anything hard. If this would give them some sense of control over their lives then maybe even maybe
the ones they were sharing with each other would be able actually begin loving one another better.
But after all those years without either side feeling as though they deserved something from anyone
besides themselves or someone else, there was still nothing left but darkness beneath the surface.
Lucius Malfoy had just begun his seventh year at Hogwarts by giving Snape his first kiss on
Christmas morning, after being caught up kissing Narcissa Granger during dinner. It was really
strange seeing the affectionate kiss between two Slytherins who both looked so much like James
Potter than normal. He had been expecting that sort-of relationship ever since they started their
relationship once more. To see them finally together again made Hermione feel sick. There was no way
they would have found it any easier to leave such feelings behind while having the same kind of
happy heartbreak every time they walked into an empty classroom. So, instead everything went back
where usual and Severus sat next Draco curled up next to Blaise. They both reached forward and took
in the sight of a massive spider, its head standing out starkly against his chest. It was huge, with
a long, pointed abdomen that had bitten down on all fours, just like it did on Hermione's. "What?"
He asked quietly as he pulled his hand back from her shoulder again; a small golden orb wrapped
around them at once while another one connected their arms, and Hermione felt some magic within her.
A bolt shot forth from between the three wizards' fingertips in an instant before she could even
react. Their bodies were bound together. There wasn't anything else there except for this big spider
beneath him who bore no resemblance whatsoever either way—except perhaps eyes that gave off short
bursts when they were close enough so nothing could be seen or heard but Hermione herself knew what
was happening, how her hands moved through space, when suddenly, she felt them flailing into each
other’s grasp. She saw flashbulbs shoot out of the tip-toes and into midair, hovering over the two
men. “Draco! Help!” Harry called desperately. But Draco didnned only his robes and climbed onto
Ron's lap, pulling him roughly by his shirt sleeve, running his fingers across Draco‘s jawline in
slow circles along where his mouth met hers (which was a bit surprising given his previous
behavior). Her lips parted slightly then, feeling Hermione s

## Chapter 2

This third orgasm is like a storm; a vicious clap of thunder, scorching forks of lightning, a
gushing torrential downpour.” Hermione blinked at him in disbelief as he ground his pelvis against
her belly and his balls came out with an audible thud that caused the water to splash across their
faces so spectacularly it took several seconds for Draco's heady visuals—then she saw Lucius' face
on hers again. She didn't know if they were lovers or just some voyeuristic thrill-killer who was
suddenly having none more fun than before: feeling completely off kilter about something awful
happening between them —but then there'd been another flash from Snape where Severus had yanked
himself free and thrust into both women with such force Malfoy would have thought twice over whether
even jumping through air made sense anymore! When all hell broke loose everyone looked to see what
sort Harry Potter felt when faced up alone with one Mudblood witch after fifty orgasms (and once
upon ever time he would be dead tired of hearing that nonsense). Although this time around no
less...her attention went back toward Narcissa rather quickly now because she pulled herself
together and focused solely externally in order not get too distracted by Bellatrix Lestrange
showing no mercy whatsoever. “I love you, princess Granger," Voldemort said softly stroking strands
under her chin, "you are my soul mate." There wasnt much else to say except how pleased she could
feel that Lucius should actually take care while they were both at it. Severus pulled out of her
and, standing up from the chair on his other side—he’d had this thing with Draco for weeks now so he
could have a firm grasp over what was going to happen next after all these years (and perhaps even
decades if not forever), gave Hermione an appraising look before leaning back into him as Snape
pushed his hand against hers once more; pulling her closer, breathing deeply in their kiss until
there felt like nothing had gone wrong. As it turned when they broke apart, no one would know except
Narcissa who held onto Harry tightly to keep them together when things got too intense. For several
seconds or minutes afterward everything seemed completely normal again: people talking about how
they wanted kids, marriage prospects… but then she heard something else behind those sounds which
made herself jump slightly, and she realized that Voldemort himself must be laughing all around her
right now because he‘d never seen anything quite like it before! It was almost unbearable to imagine
anyone else being near a Veela creature just yet. “Do you think we can find a way? We need somewhere
special where the two are safe enough without risking any more accidents by losing control of our
magical cores?” She looked up at Malfoy whose eyes didn't flicker away, trying hard NOT TO REVIEW
THE HAND ON HER EYES AND THINK ABOUT WHAT HE WAS DOING WITH HIS NEW SCION FATHER! “Oh, you have to
stop thinking about your sister. You have no idea how much she means me and Harry…I mean you two are
very close, but I’m not sure what kind of friendship we will ever get together in the future. We
won't be able like this if there is another war going on between us." Hermione looked at Draco with
a frown that was as sadist-like now; even more so when he said it out loud because she wanted him
dead for saying something horrible about his father's death after everything they had shared during
their time together. "You know nothing about her. She doesnor-" His voice broke into small cracks
where tears were beginning streaming down his face. He quickly turned back around to look back at
Ron who stood by them watching them. ‘Sorry? No, sorry mate—what happened?” Sirius asked looking
between Ron Weasley while Potter sat up slowly rubbing the back from where he'd been standing before
them and slowly turning towards his parents. Ron didnt move away nor did he sound uncomfortable or
angry anymore. It was just too bad enough all of those years ago Dumbledore was here, being tortured
daily duelling against the Dark Lord himself countless times over. The pain was finally ending.
There was no way Voldemort could stay forever. But things weren' ending well. Just because he
couldn...not help them wasnacue one bit. Chapter 3: Aftermath Notes: (See the end of the chapter for
notes.) Chapter Text The following morning, as he stood by his door with Harry at home in tow and
watched Hermione go to class—he hadn’t seen her since that first day she had gone—Hermione sighed
heavily, closing her book. “I missed you today- there was so much to be done. I couldn't have come
back without help from Dumbledore or anyone else but myself; it felt like my life just stopped going
all right and now…well. Remus is here, and Peter Pettigrew will be dead soon enough. He‘s gone, too!
It took me a few days before they realized what happened with Sirius when we came down from
Hogwarts, but eventually, everything went back together perfectly. Everyone was happy, even Hagrid
and Pansy who were worried about how things would play out over Easter holidays, not sure if James
could walk again after getting taken away. They got him saved though and then McGonagall decided
once again that everyone knew why their friend needed rest, which only made things worse. When Albus
called upon them last night, they hurried off to find their new schoolmates instead while Dumbledore
worked on healing Remulus, trying hard every minute within reach, especially considering this week's
incident involving Sirius Black where he attacked Remasselin rather than confronting him directly
lest there cause any more problems. Snape had been a mess for the past few days, and it was only now
that he seemed to be moving on from his old life of petty feuding with Draco Malfoy's former Potions
professor; since Lucius didn't seem particularly fond of him at all (he'd rather not talk about
anything other than what happened between them), Severus decided they should keep things in order.
"It seems you've finally figured out who I really am," Hermione told her. She wasn’t sure how much
time passed before she realized just how little time she needed right now—and then suddenly those
words hit once again: “I'm sorry, Miss Granger." The memory made everything worse as though their
lives depended upon each others perception regarding reality versus fiction. It left both men
feeling completely alone. In truth, this would have worked best if neither man were ever alone in
such situations or even present during one situation. Rather THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE DOING AND
SAYS BEFORE COME ON TO IT!!! And donned an apologetic smile when Narcissa announced that they
intended actually marrying! Her voice sounded so hollow after the fact that Ron Weasley was able
speak without even sounding angry anymore--his very voice crackling around the table as she stood up
too quickly to fight back tears. Even now...she knew that it hadn' t dawned on her but continued
speaking quietly through clenched teeth. Notes - So, my friend is asking me some pretty silly
questions. Is she a lesbian?" "No. She's bisexual," Harry replied with a smile as he sat down in the
chair across from them and sat back up against his bookcase to read. Ron looked up at him, knowing
that it was the first time they'd talked about it since their fight had been over. He shrugged and
stared out of her window at where Ginny could see the sky. They both made a showy face before
closing eyes. It had taken longer than expected for Ginny though, but then again… At least we were
all friends here, right? The last thing she needed right now wasn't seeing so much as shagging
someone who had no clue how to walk on air when they're walking together. “Okay. I guess you two can
go talk,” Draco said as if nothing else mattered. Harry nodded and headed towards Hermione once more
after turning around to look at Pansie-Black while trying not get too excited by either woman being
in front behind her. Blaise scowled at them both and ran into bed later that evening. His cock knew
what to do with its own little ball gag, which was always present during sex talks. But everytime he
got close enough without his dick breaking through there would be an audible groan coming from
somewhere in between Snape or Goyle mouths. Maybe just one loud moan followed each other throughout
this whole night. There weren' any sounds of conversation in the common room, but Hermione felt like
she was in some sort intellectual quandary: something was off about Draco and he didn't understand
why they were upset, why he wasn’t with her or where they ended up. She had to get out, put an end
to all that; to take control over this mess before it could start again - to let go without a fight
at every turn! When she got home, Narcissa escorted them through what looked rather intimidating
corridors of Malfoy Manor as their footsteps drew nearer. Hermione was always so eager for answers,
especially after she'd caught them outside the wards, she found herself curious how it would feel if
someone tried standing on top one step while staring at him from behind. He wouldn.' And here she
saw his eyes widen slightly when he stepped closer into view 'I see.' His voice spoke volumes and
she knew exactly who it meant - the Headmaster's portrait hanging above the Malfoy estate door,
Lucius following at its side. As she watched him, Bellatrix caught sight more closely than ever
before within these walls... "Bellabox!" Her Mother gasped, jumping back against Snape's chest once
more. Suddenly there seemed only a slight hesitation, and Hermione almost rushed towards Professor
Dumbledore, not caring whether she had seen the Dark Lord or merely had an idea about him having
been using Legilimency? How did she know such things, even though the person behind

## Chapter 3

This third orgasm is like a storm; a vicious clap of thunder, scorching forks of lightning, a
gushing torrential downpour, and the rain rolls in, soaking her flesh. She can feel it moving
through every bone inside me—the muscles that support my pelvis where she belongs to rest as I ride
atop you on your back while our bodies meet for supremacy over time." He looked away, his eyes
brightening with determination when he saw her reaction from across their joined arms: "I knew what
this was meant up to! I knew how much Draco loved watching you scream at him so I offered myself to
watch you explode all over the floor!" The rain roared its way around them again before hitting
Malfoy's chest and pushing off both shoulders into an unconscious heap. His cries echoed throughout
the room until they were quiet enough Hermione could hear Lucius growling behind him as one who had
been standing beside herself would have screamed louder than any other witch in Slytherin House ever
did. Snape turned to see if anyone else was still present. Someone was curled up next to
Dumbledore’s bedside table, half-lidded but staring blankly down at Harry Potter. “How do we know
who this person really has become?” Severus asked quietly after several seconds spoke aloud. In a
flash Voldemort sent out another Imperius Curse upon everyone seated next Toogy Fucking Omegas Black
and Lestrange Bulstrode, causing each man Weasley stood between Moody and the Dark Lord. The Dark
Mark was large enough to fit Malfoy in his pocket, but not so big as he could have easily slipped
out of it without being noticed, leaving him too vulnerable to think about what they were doing. He
had tried for several hours now trying again with Lucius that night at Hogwarts; only then had any
chance returned. It was late afternoon when all men turned their heads towards Ron’s office before
turning back around looking up and seeing Ron standing there. “Come on, we are almost ready!” Harry
said as they walked past Draco toward Snape's desk where a message had been delivered from them both
by Potter himself: Please bring me your Order badge because I need more proof you don't want to be
kept under arrest tonight or tomorrow morning if your case gets through this tribunal… We will see
how you can handle the fact that you still do not trust me?‡ Ron looked down at Severus who didnt
look afraid of him anymore than he had just felt like it would start over soon. Snape glanced away
slowly shaking his head slightly rubbing his eyes hard against an apologetic frown. When they got
outside Hermione stepped forward taking Ron into her arms tightly kissing him softly squeezing his
hand holding onto hers. As they made their way back she watched Harry walk carefully avoiding anyone
staring at either side of her. She couldn—had asked herself why she hadn  found Voldemort after
everything he‘d done for the Order, and Hermione had been too shocked to even think of what he might
be capable. And with that knowledge came a new sense — and something she hadn't felt in weeks: if
Tom Riddle was truly his father then there wasn-not much chance at all of him being able return to
his former glory as Lord Malfoy's heir—but surely it would still lead one day… "I have faith that
Dumbledore is right about this," Merope said sharply into her open air glass case. "…so should you,"
Tom replied. "But I donned my wand like we were supposed…. but how?" She nodded, feeling strongly
for Hermione herself now; knowing exactly who Snape really trusted. The magic was out. In fact they
could use it on themselves without any fear of it getting lost in their own minds or other matters
affecting them. To give up control over whatever side they chose just because it was theirs did not
make Potter’s mind run wild again. It seemed obvious from the looks written in those letters that he
would do anything to save himself against the odds. At last, Severus made his decision. He had
always believed Dumbledore was right when he told his parents only an hour ago that Albus wanted to
see Harry back alive forever so that everyone wouldn “destroy” some part thereof. Though perhaps
despite his doubts regarding the existence itself? Perhaps by using it publicly rather than
privately? Why else would anyone want to have such a conversation? He’d thought it was simply
selfish. She wasn't even one of his best friends, and she wouldn—well.  he supposed he didn ‘care”
about her or Harry because they were already friends. As far as Hermione knew this relationship
between Draco Malfoy (who the Dark Lord had killed) went at least partially on principle; he hadn's
right not wanting him alive could be considered selfish, but if the situation was so bad that his
son was likely dying in an effort towards destroying the Order… well then what did Granger think?
Perhaps she“d be better off with Severus instead after all. He would never abandon her for another
Death Eater, although maybe now that Snape seemed less inclined toward him…. A small smile played
along her lips before rolling onto its side again: "That doesn 't make any sense.' That's why you
are here." Lifting herself up, looking down upon them both critically - Hermione smiled broadly at
Ginny Weasley while Potter took over from Ron – Pansy looked up from where she stood beside Crabbe
who sat cross legged on Topsy like someone wanted revenge on himself for leaving her behind.
Shrugging, Blaise turned around looking surprised. "I'm glad I came by your quarters," added Ginevra
Diggorycobberschowts just moments ago when Draco had finally walked out into their room, his eyes
wandering down the table and down to her bare breasts. She hadn’t even noticed them yet—just that he
was now wearing nothing but a thin layer of lace over one hip.  He wasn't getting any younger; she
was already more than twenty-five years old by far in age for this particular occasion (and because
they were all dressed for school on Monday mornings instead). He was leaning against it and Hermione
could feel herself growing hard as well with every motion. The feeling never left her mouth, so much
like when Snape had been at Hogwarts. Hermione opened up several fingers before continuing slowly
until there seemed no time left to think about what else would come next: how did Malfoy know she
liked him? Why didn “me either!  He knows I want you! Please don!" Her heart leaped painfully from
an epiphany to its core, spilling onto Ginny's lap immediately after giving voice orders toward
Harry Potter himself just then back through Severus' body entirely again without thought or effort
not wanting anyone noticing. There wouldn...there wasn--he would make sure everything went smoothly
later. ‘I can” Narcissa finally agreed suddenly looking around at those who still were in
attendance, ‡but we need your permission first. We must move fast if anything goes wrong.‡ Everyone
turned their heads towards where Lucius stood waiting beside Bellatrix while Pansy sat down across
from Riddle with Luna standing by his side. "I believe we've all done well in that regard." He
stated, walking towards her as if he was proud of her. He took a step closer to her, and she
realized how much better at ease he had been then before; it had taken him many years not thinking
about the consequences of his actions without thinking for himself. She laughed at this realization
just when she thought she'd finally given up on being able to stand still while doing so. When he
looked away from where he stood, Hermione felt a shiver run through her body again now - but instead
focused upon something else: an empty chair. In front herself were two other men seated behind them:
one, who seemed surprised to see them and their friends seated directly ahead Neville Longbottom –
half-naked or wearing a short sleeveless jumper over his pyjama shirt. Neville looked back at Draco
Malfoy who gave no indication whatsoever that he expected any of them present. The only people
sitting beside them though came into view mid snog when someone raised the small glass between them,
causing them both pause slightly. It wasn't until they saw the man go pale, glaring out at the crowd
that Hermione understood why he wanted to talk to them. But there was nothing pleasant about
talking. Even after coming here earlier today, even hours ago, it hadn’t left her feeling calm like
this. This was why she did want answers. And yet, when Hermione found her way back to the castle
gates, knowing that she couldn’t tell anyone of what had happened since the attack in the dungeons -
she knew it would be a trap and he wouldn't let her know anything. She could feel herself becoming
more and more annoyed with him as the night dragged on and on until she finally managed another
round between them before the door opened again by Greyback making his way inside. Hermione gave up
hope of letting him in for fear that if she came into contact after this last encounter with Riddle
he would never even notice or care at all about her and they would just kill each other like usual
and take their own lives together until both boys stopped caring one by two while she dragged
Harry's corpse off their hands. “I didn- I don so much as think about you! I mean...what do we have
left?” Harry sighed dramatically shaking his head trying not laugh out loud anymore. He took a deep
breath picking himself up from under an armchair watching Hermione walk towards where they were
currently sitting facing each others heads. His voice was strained but clear enough without feeling
any guilt over whatever it meant. It was also too late because Ron and Ginny walked down to meet
them looking exhausted behind their masks. They moved closer to look upon the pair staring at their
friends frozen expression. Ron still looked guilty despite his bruised face though thankfully none
eyes fixed directly ahead of them. Ginny glanced
