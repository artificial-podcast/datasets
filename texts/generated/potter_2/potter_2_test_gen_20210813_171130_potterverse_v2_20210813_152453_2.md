“Oh, fuck this,” Bellatrix says. “Here’s how it is, pet. You can never touch my cock unless you

promise to let me come inside of every single one that comes out and show your father what I am

capable with!‡ The woman who used the word begets Hermione from her spot on top before moving in

close. She pulls away immediately and she looks down at herself as her own orgasm hits her. A flash

behind her lashes causes them back up, causing everyone else around Bella's head frowning. Hermione

knows why they are staring, she knows exactly where she is right now because of last night but for

the first time ever, Hermione doesn't want anyone looking at her like a parent or an adult. Belladon

lowers her chin into his palm, taking in everything he has captured so far and leaving just some

more bits of Hermione's clit left intact. "Are you okay?" Sirius asks, sounding panicked. He sits

himself next to Remus and once all three have their attention back on him Ron pushes Neville over to

stand beside Hermione. Both boys look surprised while Hermione struggles against the hard line

between Harry Potter' legs that Harry is holding onto for dear life. Realising something isnt very

right about being held by these two people, Ron leans forward and forces both boys to lean closer to

each other and push apart even harder than usual. Once there hasn- Ever since receiving detention

during the war, neither of them have been able to find out what happened. Hermione is only a week

away from being admitted into Hogwarts and she knows that if they ever see her again it will be

because Dumbledore had killed him while protecting Harry and Ron. As Sirius puts down his fork in

disgust he looks at McGonagall who nods in agreement as she has learned about this all her life and

by extension Remus too. "Good afternoon Professor." Minerva says, sounding relieved but also a

little annoyed with herself for not knowing how long Snape would have until then to explain

everything. A few minutes after Neville got back up onto the pitch towards Gryffindor Tower an owl

flies over and sits next Toogy's desk where he finds himself staring at. For some reason Albus feels

like there are worse things than death; just waiting for someone else or something. Walking through

a corridor full on students He sees Cedric, Dean Thomas (who he thinks is still recovering from

beating his head off), Hannah Abbott Lupin-Black Jr., Katie Bellsworth Nott Sr.? Hagrid walks past

Poppy looking at both boys confused before stopping when he notices Padfoot sitting right across

from them. Bagman makes a face and shakes his hand angrily shaking everyone's hand so that no one

can get near him. After making sure everyone is safe people move quickly inside the Great Hall which

causes Lockhart’Safari team members including Crabbe having their eyes scanned wide awake. "I need

to make sure you know that we're here for you, Hermione." "That's not the point," she said as he

spoke up again before making his way over and closing the door behind him in a matter of seconds

leaving her alone with Bellatrix still sleeping. The two boys stared at each other silently until it

was time they got back to bed. Bella felt her stomach drop when Draco came down from sleep once

more. She hadn't realized how close she had been since Harry woke early enough to tell them about

her. Her skin prickled with concern as she stepped away from where Ron stood and walked out into

Grimmauld Place and began searching the room which now consisted only three beds. After looking

through several rooms, finding only one room she decided on going to. When she reached her third

bedroom there were four of those that weren’t in use and all except Potter who sat by himself in

front almost completely devoid even though it wasn ‘his'. They didn' wait long to leave or walk

inside either but instead just left after telling the others what happened. Once outside they waited

until all five people saw and then disapparated together leaving them standing in no doubt what they

heard. If she could get someone else to listen to them right now without feeling like it is nothing

- if they knew anything...that would be good enough because whatever they did was true, but also

very dangerous. And so far Hermione had felt a little uncertain about her future. She was afraid

that she wouldn’t be able to leave Hogwarts by herself for another year or two; and even if it did

happen, there were things she would need time away from home to focus on before leaving for the

summer months. It wasn't like Malfoy could spend his holidays in France with no friends around him –

not anymore anyway! But he loved life, which meant spending time at Grimmauld Place and reading all

those books Granger had put up over Christmas when they'd shared a common room together back in

fourth year — not because of anything Malfoy would say, really: it simply didn' mean so much right

now… But then again … he never let go of what he thought should matter to him. He knew better than

anyone who‘d been close to Narcissa that Draco shouldn “feel guilty” about hurting someone else .

Especially since he didn   know how long the consequences might last, and both their parents saw no

reason why he couldn just leave them forever without any more pain relief? Couldn I have done worse?

His temper had flared into something resembling fury as soon after returning to school, almost

physically tearing out Draco's arm between clenched teeth. They went through one hellish winter

holiday, spent in each other homes alone, living in an alternate universe where everything seemed

different every day compared against some perfect reality in existence…. And here he stood
