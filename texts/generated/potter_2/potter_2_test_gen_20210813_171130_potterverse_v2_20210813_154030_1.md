The third orgasm is like a storm; a vicious clap of thunder, scorching forks of lightning, and then

the fourth I feel you reach for me.” “I see that it sounds wonderful to you? The feeling goes deeper

than your orgasms or my kisses—it reaches out toward all things good and evil and all those who seek

them. It's why you love reading, because in the end we all become human beings, only by our

actions." Lucius exhaled sharply from his hold on her shoulders. "What about Severus?" Her hand shot

up as he caught sight behind him: Draco towering over Hermione at their side with bated breath

before they both lost themselves entirely. When Snape’s face fell to hers she lifted her head to

kiss each man there again but this time just above one more person so everyone could hear what was

happening between theirs… And when Malfoy turned away she smiled against herself while looking back

down into Harry Potter eyes where still pulsing through every vein deep within himself... A warm

glow danced across Ginny Weasley Granger smile softening slightly after hearing her say something

similar in hopes some other male would find it amusing. She felt cold comfort spreading around her

body throughout these last few weeks until finally realizing that she had been lying awake most days

since the Triwizard Tournament. After a few moments' sleep deprivation Ron woke up thinking that

someone had come knocking downstairs early enough to search for Neville Longbottom. Unfortunately

for George however Remus couldn't get past his fear of losing him to Voldemort and was so worried

about the safety or wellbeing he had, while Harry was safe in his own home. The last thing that

happened after their arrival at Grimmauld Place were the two of them having a conversation with one

another's parents as they talked over breakfast. "Mione?" Neville asked once Ron had returned from

visiting relatives who hadn’t yet been able to go back to school. “You guys are not here! You

can”—he looked down at the floor and saw only Harry standing there)—"He is going somewhere I know

nothing about!" Hermione said, her eyes narrowed. She didnve time like this. Even if she did it

would still be okay. This was where all the trouble started for both of these kids. They knew what

Ron and Harry needed most, but none wanted their father. It was better than being alone; without any

idea why anyone cared how much Draco loved whatever it cost him. In fact, no matter how hard it

might have seemed to upset even Sirius Black to hear such an absurd rumor, everything came crashing

down around them when Draco Malfoy walked into Hogsmeade early on Saturday morning. His hair hung in

its usual bun along side his shoulders, so deep he could barely see straight. He wore dark green

trousers and a light blue top underneath a black shirt. Hermione wasnned some sort magical mask too,

and for someone so young it felt like a lifetime ago. “Who is this?” he asked, voice low as the man

stood tall enough to look at her. She looked up sharply, watching the stranger carefully before

turning on his heel in an effort not take any chances. Tom gazed down into black depths. The

darkness took him off guard by making him cringe against Hermione's touch. He knew what she saw

inside of him when she was with her friends. His hands curled behind his back, gripping his scar.

Her lips pressed firmly against hers as she slowly brought their faces together before closing them

tightly around one another once more from below without parting her eyes. They spoke aloud while her

hair cascaded across every surface but beneath each other all night long until they were standing

there as though nothing had happened; staring into each others eyes only seeming wholly apart

despite having both worlds turned upside-down within moments. And then something else occurred that

caused Tom flickered away quickly. Something dark. Inescapable or beyond his control… But perhaps

instead than the shadowing gaze Dumbledore gave him—the sight set loose over his mind just how

powerful the magic truly could be. "What?" Hermione swallowed heavily through heavy breaths, tears

dripping onto her cheeks even as her chest tightened painfully under her arms. "…it didn't happen."

A deep sigh escaped Abraxas' mouth unbidden. There were no words left either, whether intended nor

imagined. Instead thoughts flooded out again, running through her like water from a leaky pond and

threatening to drown her as the next wave passed by in rapid succession until she felt it, too

overwhelmed with its power for words or an answer that would calm her heart down enough so he could

say it himself without fear of interruption.  But then her eyes darted back up again at last;

Draco's expression now transformed into one full blown panic attack, his forehead crumpling against

hers as if someone had hit him with their bare hands! What was happening? Where were they going?!

She didn't have time anymore—the moment was past. She started to turn away but stopped herself

before anything could cross either girl’s path. “Draco…! Hermione-what-have-you done!? I told you

not even touching me will stop this mess!” The first thing Lucius saw when seeing them in such a

state all over themselves shocked both boys greatly —and more importantly Severus Snape than any

other man ever known since Narcissa Malfoy had died suddenly becoming what might be considered some

sort intellectual goldmine on Slytherin House grounds! And yet, despite her best efforts towards

being reasonable once every ounce went off board (except maybe for those few moments where Potter's

mind wandered) Granger remained silent. No matter how much she tried desperately trying keep quiet,

it wasn't working. There just never seemed logic or reason in hearing her name spoken aloud amidst
