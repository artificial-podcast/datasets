I cannot resist. I feel a strange urge and call within me for you, this desire to save someone's

life or myself." He started speaking again, but she kept up her tone even as he spoke. "How about

you? Have anything else come of it?" She shrugged. His lips moved in a curious line before his eyes

moved back into hers. They were both staring at the same thing they'd been doing all evening: their

hands touching each other passionately, one of them giving him what felt like an enormous amount

that had never happened between them before; his arms wrapped around either side behind his head

while another hand cupped either shoulder over theirs together with more strength than Hermione

could ever imagine feeling. It was so hot, so wet… and yet it still hurt. Not only that—it made

Draco's stomach knot itself hard enough on its own – when his fingertips caressed lightly against

skin and then upon flesh and blood… But it also caused those two things not just pain anymore —

feelings of anger (for him), fear now belonging too fully inside his body (on top) because no matter

what he did to himself and the ones surrounding him, he continued loving it. For her…. And for

Harry... Even though that morning’s events weren't entirely unpleasant, they almost didnned some

formality with how awful they looked to Harry Potter right after they left the Room-Elves house. “Do

think your father is mad at Dumbledore,” Ron whispered, “I know that. He’s trying to get the

wizarding world involved. If you don't want the world being an obstacle in his path then maybe he

should be doing something else and we can work it out together. But this has been a hard year for

him. How are we going?‪ Hermione shook her head, looking down at Harry who was still staring up into

Snape's eyes as if afraid of what would happen next. It was obvious now that she wanted Voldemort

dead. When they had talked last night about how there were no plans between them on Wednesday

evening (which, honestly not many people knew), Malfoy suddenly came to their side with another

request: Couldnt any one of us keep our hands off anyone except Harry tonight? She wasn—he knew

exactly why she needed someone to touch him tonight; he knows because his father tried so hard every

day to protect me from my family since I could start school today! My family doesnned robes like

snakes before Voldemort took over Hogwarts…and when he asked me whether or never I would let my

magic do anything to make sure that everything was okay…well, yes, he said yes…but….if it isn-

then...what happens if he finds out where I go tomorrow? What if all those memories have already

taken over?" Voldemort turned towards Potter again but before he could say anything, Draco stepped

forward too quickly letting loose a long sigh. "Ron, I know you don't like it, but-" he stopped

short as he pulled her in close, wrapping his arms around the back of Hermione's head and burying

their mouths together again to hold onto each other for dear life until their noses finally broke

apart. They were both grinning at one another while she moaned quietly into Draco’s mouth. Ron let

out a soft moan that caused his cock harden slightly before he moved forward, grabbing her face

roughly and kissing her deeply over hers; making sure there was no pain or anger left between them.

The moment they kissed passionately, they fell asleep on top without any sleep. Ginny woke up early

enough to find her roommates already asleep by then so she decided not to go looking for them either

way. She went to the bathroom to grab some lunch and brought her hair back to its normal hue when

someone called after her. “Hey, hey!” Hermione greeted brightly, reaching towards him and placing an

arm across from Harry who had just come running upstairs to pick a pillow up. Her friends stared at

her with wide eyes. ~~~*~~~~*~~ Once everyone was settled and their roommations in bed once more

began playing Seeker, Ron tried saying something but he heard Hermione speak instead. He knew why

now. While the two boys were sitting in front staring blankly at themselves outside under all sorts

kind lighting lights almost every time they got closer than ten feet away. “And I’m surprised you

haven't taken it harder on yourself, Hermione?” Draco asks in a low voice and Hermione nods her

head. The other two boys keep talking about how good the past week has been, about Hermione being

around people who actually cared for them. As soon as Draco says that, he pulls his wand and walks

over to Blaise without looking at him again, ‘why are we here, love?' he asked once everyone else

had left. Ron starts explaining about where he is going, what he's doing with himself but then Harry

interrupts when Harry looks up at Hermione asking if he wants answers or some kind of explanation

because she doesnt want answers either way. Even though Malfoy isn- ‡Shut up, Malfoy! You think

so?! --he yells back and grabs Hermione by the wrists and yanks her against their sides. They both

yell louder now and stare into each others eyes. It makes Harry realize something else is happening

between them and right before he can say anything else to stop them from hurting themselves, Ron

snaps, almost knocking off his shirt while holding Hermione onto Ron like an animal. Suddenly

Voldemort notices and sneaks out. And just seconds later comes screams and all hell breaks loose

inside of them as the Death Eaters come crashing down towards them, hitting them upside down hard

against one another. Voldemort watches as Malfoy kneels beside Voldemort in front half inch heels
