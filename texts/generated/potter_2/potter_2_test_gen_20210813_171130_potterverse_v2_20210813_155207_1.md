Hermione knew the curse, but she didn’t feel that it was a valid one. She wasn't sure how to handle

her feelings for Hermione Granger, and now knowing about this potion, she felt like she had betrayed

them. When Bellatrix had told everyone in Hogwarts that they were to be sent away, that Voldemort

would not let them go, Hermione realized she hadn ‘been lied' into thinking he”d been lying. That

Bells words had really hurt her because of what happened during their first year together after

Azkaban—and if anything Draco should have done differently. It left no doubt as much uncertainty

over whether or when they could go back to class again. Since then everything seemed different with

both Harry Potter being taken away from him by Narcissa Malfoy; something which caused tension

between classes at school longer than usual. This time around there weren-not many people around for

meals until lunch, so Hermione was still feeling alone. To get some food for herself on the way

home, however - especially since all students had eaten before dinner – Ron threw up his hands in

front Ofsted demanding to know why they needed an extra student meal allowance unless Professor

McGonagall wanted more. The Deputy Headmaster looked down at her suspiciously while standing beside

Pansy Parkinson whose gaze moved to where Daphne Greengrass stood waiting outside Pomfrey's office

door (in other parts only) looking rather smug: "Mr Weasley? What is going wrong?" Blaise asks,

sounding surprised. "What the hell are you doing here?", Draco says, looking annoyed as he looks at

the door with a frown on his face and then sighs. After some time of silence, Ron walks over to

Blanche who has her arms crossed in front of him while Harry sits down next to Hermione whose arm

rests between hers when they break apart. For about ten seconds, nothing happens but then one by-

then Neville finally speaks up. As soonas possible after that Fred comes out of nowhere and starts

pacing back and forth across the room. 'Come! I'm okay!' He whispers and it takes several minutes

for everyone around them stop speaking before an older woman steps forward, something which causes

both Harry's parents' faces reddened considerably. Finally, Minerva stands from where she stood

almost instantly, standing far too close so the younger witch can see Sirius; Remus and Augusta

sitting behind her. Both students seem tense even though no one else seems willing or able because

there isn't much other than Neville staring at them. Once everything settles down, all three of the

adults drift into conversation once more. About two hours later everyone leaves the Great Hall

without another word, leaving only the boys alone. A few moments later, Madam Pomfrey hurries past

them in searchable clothes, robes made entirely white instead their green ones have black sleeves.

When she finds them right away McGonagall walks briskly through towards Hermione and Harry, "Are you

going to keep me here tonight?" "Yes." Hermione says. Remus nods and after a couple of minutes he

gets up from the couch and sits down next Neville and Augusta have breakfast before heading out of

Grimmauld Place with Sirius and Albus following them so that they can head back home once more in

order for dinner to be ready without Draco becoming worried about what happened at Hogwarts again

because something is wrong this time as well as how it would go if his Papa got hurt last night or

when she woke him too late on her way to get sorted into Gryffindor Tower instead of being left

alone by himself until all of their homework is finished then where are we? After exchanging looks

over the small group of five Ron and Hermione leave together leaving Ginny and Luna behind along

side Neville who has just made her rounds outside of Hogsmeade looking like someone who's really not

afraid anymore than anyone else was even during their school year! So glad I'm there today… See ya

tomorrow….. A/N: For those reading my story please see Alpha:SorceressOfGryffort #~~~# Pupils

(Hermione) POV As soon as morning came everyone had been taken care off hand and headed upstairs

quickly while Dean sat across the table between the two boys staring blankly at one another

contemplating the meaninglessness inside of his best friend’s eyes. “I know Mum will be upset but…”

Harry says, trying to keep his voice steady. Hermione looks at Ron as though she has seen something,

and then frowns, ‘Why are you asking? Why is this so hard for me not knowing what’s going on?! I

didn't even want to hear the news! It  made me realise that they could just stay here or get out of

the way if it got out before dinner time because we can‡t leave them alone when we have our wands

trained. If we were attacked in the middle class by a Death Eater - which would that do anything

other than cause disruption, or worse – why don-what-you think there wouldn'a been an alternative

way out?" he asks concerned and looking between her two friends, both frowning, Harry nods once and

sets his jaw with reluctance; all the while Ron continues pushing away from her, getting up off him

behind a table. A few minutes later, after breakfast break is over, Hermione opens the door to find

Fred sitting on one side chatting quietly with Ginny while Draco walks into another room. "Mum…"

Hermione starts and Neville looks around nervously too, wanting more answers about how things are

progressing within the Ministry itself. There's something that Hermione finds odd: Percy is still

gone, George Weasley is dead right now, Emma Fudge isn….. "Hermione…" She starts to say, wondering

whether Malfoy was involved
