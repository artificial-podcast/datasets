“Oh, fuck this,” Bellatrix says. “Here’s how it is, pet. You can get up and go somewhere else for a

bit before you fall asleep. I have all the books on your dorm mates list of course. Just do it by

yourself when you're ready.‡ Hermione smiles at her best friend as she picks up Hermione to walk

back to bed in hopes that the other witch will be more interested than she already was. It is

Saturday evening then so Harry has just finished up his breakfast with some friends who are coming

over from work but he doesn't want to bother them right now because they don- They walked into their

bedroom where there were two empty chairs next door, one behind the kitchen counter which didndled

away from people because the second had been open enough for Harry not even know what happened until

very recently when he heard loud banging on the door. He immediately knew why since everyone stopped

talking about him after hearing every word anyone said! As if that made any sense anymore anyway;

both those things cause panic attacks everywhere. "Harry!" Hermione hears something in front someone

and turns around suddenly, looking down towards herself. Her eyes widen slightly thinking that maybe

Malfoy would tell her truth or stop lying altogether? She looks between Harry's arms like he really

wants information, but somehow finds that it doesnt make sense either. Not only did Malfoy keep his

mouth shut during class while he sat there and he left without saying anything, leaving Draco to

wonder if it was really a question of the mind. Severus was always so attentive when they were

alone—so easy with her that even Snape would have been surprised by his own attentions or attempts

at seduction after everything she'd just done.     (though usually he hadn’t.) But Hermione didn't

seem bothered by any such interference; she seemed content simply having him around for all she

cared about: affection in every sense imaginable, adoration wrapped up neatly into one big hug as

though nothing had happened between them. “So, what are we going on? Are you excited about this new

game I invented? Or does your love make playing some sort more exciting than others?" Lucius asked

quietly, his voice clipped but firm. "I don," Narcissa answered evenly before turning away from

Harry's face while looking down over their joined hands like an animal exhibit. It took several

minutes until everyone else turned around together again — both Malfoy men staring back at Potter

nervously worriedly eyeing each other anxiously waiting patiently behind open doors that opened only

to be led inside by Ron Weasley who appeared absolutely bewildered. The man looked very much out-of

sorts under Voldemort himself now knowing exactly how utterly ridiculous this whole situation

sounded yet clearly not thinking through what he knew to say to Harry first thing Monday morning. So

far none came out loud except 'Because I want my money back' which went against whatever plan

Dumbledore may have set for her. And she felt like the only woman who could handle herself and make

them work had been a woman named Hermione Granger, but now it was Luna Lovegood that would be first

to do so 'I hope you don't mind.' She knew that Luna's words were meant as an apology, not anything

personal or platonic at all - just what they needed from each other in this moment of confusion over

whether Severus should return home with his parents or not; those things did matter, really

mattered. Whatever brought them together, however small their differences might feel tonight – even

if there wasn’t much to say – it helped no one else. The night before Ginny Weasley‘s death Draco

Malfoy had called her a Mudblood whore and told Pansy about how he had used some kind magical charm

on Blaise Zabini to bring him down during last year when Ron finally broke up everything between us.

When Harry Potter, despite being extremely jealous of Draco trying something at least resembling

friendship, said something similar to stop Crookshanks (the Muggle-born who came to Hogwarts looking

very pissed off) from attacking Scorpius when they had both been around for four months! After

Crabbe tried doing his best impersonating Quidditch hero McGonagall found out later that Professor

Flitwick had told everyone “she”d left because Voldemort was too powerful and Draco had a feeling

his reputation wouldn’t last much longer. It wasn't that he was in love with Hermione, it just felt

like she could feel him around her and yet he couldn “feel” her at all. In fact...he knew better

than to think it was possible for some of the older Slytherins on Hogwarts House - especially since

the Malfoys were known as Voldemort's Death Eaters after their very first duel with Riddle! He didn?

Really did not know what this was about, but even if he did know, there would be no way he could go

from being one among many Death Eater families without having heard about Voldemort or his

followers. That was the point: they would kill anyone who defied them and nothing more. When

everyone else was out fighting, he would simply ignore any evidence that showed himself weaker. And

then people started to try things against Malfoy; he remembered the days when it seemed people were

trying so hard because of how low-level blood magic levels gave off—the same sort where they thought

people with high blood power got hurt by spells cast faster—and finally when he got back to

Gryffindor Tower, Voldemort disappeared into thin air. Not only was Harry Potter dead now (he'd been

declared insane) despite most attempts — he still managed multiple prophecies and school records

throughout every year and another prophecy called "The Dark Lord‘s Curse" said to have killed

Dumbledore. The curse could also say
