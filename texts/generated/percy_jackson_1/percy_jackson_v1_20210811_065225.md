'Later that night, we got into bed and fell into a rare, dreamless sleep'

## Chapter 1

Later that night, we got into bed and fell into a rare, dreamless sleep. Nico was asleep in his own

bed, wrapped up under the blankets he'd been sleeping on for all of this time."We're back," I said

as our voices caught up with him; it wasn't like people were listening to us or anything; they just

knew what was happening. "Nico?""I'm fine, okay? The other side is going down.""What's going through

your head now?!" Ron asked me."You know you can control yourself!"He told them everything about

himself, how when Will woke at eleven months old, he had gone crazy-""I am not insane-" We both cut

ourselves off from eachother by telling Harry these things: that Voldemort didn’t die, that Hecate

died with Heresies after He sent her a letter pleading She would accept him again, even if she

wanted him dead, but no one came forward because...and Hermione refused To tell anyone else until

Dumbledore cleared out the Ministry. When Cedric Diggory was discovered unconscious and tortured,

everyone agreed that Dumbledore was right. And so began Ginny Weasley talking over us every morning

while Percy and Annabeth talked about how different their worlds might be once Hogwarts was finished

being destroyed without any sign Of Voldemort - which only made sense since everybody thought

something had happened there.The next day, Piper and Jason sat around waiting for school work to

start before heading home. Once dinner started, the two of them set off for their respective dorms

and when they finally reached it was empty as all three of Hogwarts' classes were having a quiet

conversation.             “What are you doing here? It isn't like we have any homework or anything…

but I am trying my best... So yeah what else is going on with this situation that Harry has been in

since he left us at school?! What do Ron think about me being gone now anyway?! Oh well just

thinking around him can get boring! Not only does Marvus want one of his professors teaching magic

anymore (and apparently Sirius wants another), so there's no way anyone would be able help if she

had said something bad enough after spending time alone while studying today-    Melody stopped mid

sentence “Yeah sorry Melody donned your uniform because Umbridge didnnuff yesterday.. We need some

rest from tomorrow morning too though right then and there Nico needs practice again.-A voice called

out through her head  The fact Hermione wasnTracey found herself bouncing between bedposts

throughout most nights; even worse than those times where Chiron went outside muttering under his

breath over different topics which sometimes caused everyone within Camp Half Blood especially

Hufflepuff to turn towards Pansy instead of sitting next earlobe member who looked down upon Trudy

making fun of Granger without actually paying attention, yet still seemed to keep talking once more.

Thankfully Daphne hadn't heard of anything else, and she wasn’t sure why he was so upset about

that.             And then the topic hit her like a tonic before it stopped… She knew Nico could

never have seen his face at all when Hermione came in early from somewhere near Hogwarts with him...

And yet there were still moments where Harry felt something go through Melody as if this might be an

emergency for them to deal With but also get some rest after classes had ended (this is going on too

long).                As Pansy took another deep breath while waiting anxiously behind Will's door-

probably hoping they would figure out what happened next soon! It didn? Umbridge couldn? Wait until

later since now everyone will think differently without being able To see everything first thing

tomorrow morning or not For whatever reason,Pacey sighed quietly under one arm “It seems you

havenned up enough already anyway I am. We are doing our homework together today because we need

time during break these days instead of studying outside Of course every weekend people can just

leave me alone only reading my mind However mostly trying to remember lines isn; So don tell anyone

how much trouble Hades has been taking over Nowadays most teachers areno say nothing Do your own

research You won t understand eventually Hmmm well no matter What do u know Be quiet The two sets of

twins glanced back into each other staring daggers ahead Well done girls They really did smile It

was all for the show. That's not to say there weren't some more people on their feet, it wasn’t a

surprise that they were still waiting outside of the stadium as he headed into his third game in

three days The twins had almost turned back time when Nico got off her bus and stopped at the tunnel

entrance (so far), she smiled and waved him goodbye before heading towards the Quidditch pitch next

door. There was much chatter about how Hermione would get better with practice if Chiron told them

exactly what she wanted right now… maybe even bring new players or keep training faster since last

year  She walked past one of her friends after talking to Melody again who sat down behind Will‘s

desk looking absolutely delighted “I know we are going to do this but I want you guys here today

because tomorrow is another day...and tonight will be good! Can any god let me see your gifts?” He

nodded once giving Harry permission to walk over so Draco could meet up too Quickly leaving both

boys alone together without anyone noticing And then walking inside Hogwarts having only been six

months old; Weasley looked like an eleven-year nympho standing by herself watching from above using

a pair shadow puppets To make sure no other demigod ever saw Malfoy dressed like a goddess during

her first term In fact some wizarding school students might have noticed just getting caught trying

out something different while wearing black robes So I went to the common room and tried not be

surprised. It was mostly empty but there were two tables with three people in them There were

several chairs across from me as well Hari looked at her friend who had a bow on his head The others

sat around him looking impressed like they knew what he was talking about They even talked of magic

for some reason, it wasn’t anything new when she first met Nico… Hestia smiled “Alright guys let's

get going then we can go back down here Will will you? We have lunch soon enough so please don't

hesitate if that is alrightHari pulled away into a corner clutching an apple hanging off her

shoulder saying goodbyeThe rest of us walked up next door Blaise walking over quickly pulling

himself together behind Hazel holding onto one leg helping both Hecate and Apollo grab their

things They got started laughing all night hard before dawn leaving no food left until breakfast

which meant nothing except more homework or exams needed after dinner When everyone else finally

woke Max opened Pansy”Wait wait are these wizards really dead?" She asked frowning"Yep." Jason

stated "That would explain why neither of them died yet," Reyna said shockedNico shrugged just

sitting by herself yawned rubbing crumbs under his chinI shook my head almost awakePercy blinked

again Percy nodded shaking hands resting against mine making sure Piper didnned a pendant too My

eyes fluttered open remembering how she'd been crying in my bed. “I’m sorry I don't get to keep you

from me, but can I?” She blushed and shook her head yes, as if it was a no-no between us being able

be together right now. Thank you for that little kindness, You saved the day! It‘s nice that your

dad would listen so patiently, he always does. The more we know about each other they'll become

closer. As much magic of course has come into play with this quest though—my powers are getting

stronger by the second (which is really cool), because when Nico had gotten close to Hades again He

was still a ghost at heart. Nowadays his father will probably take care not only keeping him alive

but also teaching people what kind deadliness to look out on. But even then things like that

aren really going away forever, Will reminded himself every time someone touched his or hers that

something else happened…He couldn  actually tell Harry anything either since Hermione wouldn' do any

weird magic stuff anymore...but whatever those thoughts were coming back strong enough there was

nothing stopping them once they got here We should go talk later How could one person possibly bring

up such an important subject without knowing their own minds And maybe find ways around it If ever

anyone tried to explain themselves through language Then surely all demigods understand why Gods

exist Why mortals need our help What's life worth living

## Chapter 2

Later that night, we got into bed and fell into a rare, dreamless sleep. “How are you?” Hermione

asked in confusion. I shrugged it off as not knowing what I was going to say for the next three

hours or so until Harry woke up at four o'clock on October one morning. We were both asleep when Ron

came running towards us from his room trying desperately hard make sure he didn't fall over by

accident. The rest of the girls seemed confused but couldn- Not even five minutes later they found

out who Nico di Angelo really had been hiding away somewhere. He looked like an old man with long

grey hair floating down his back. His dark glasses perched high on top him made his eyes look more

menacing than usual and there werenned two large bags under his nose holding something called 'Gift

cards'. One contained charmspeak written in Greek meaning "What's this? How could she know?"

Everyone stared at each other shocked except Leo and Clarisse who just shook their heads. Jason

explained everything happening after Percy left because people started asking questions about how

Persephone would get rid of him if Will did anything else drastic without her help… Maybe all those

demigods still knew where Hades lived! But none ever questioned whether Annabeth would be able

handle being part god during the war... After dinner everybody went upstairs hoping no Umbridge girl

showed through again since nobody liked Cho Chang much anymore (and Chiron wasnt happy either).

Instead, everyone watched outside looking at the huge empty house that was already on their

way.             “I have to go back so I can help Harry-oh… whatever is going up will be fine? And

what about you guys?! You are all here for me! We need your family and friends together too much!!

Please don't let this happen again  anyone else would kill us if we did it without our parents or

others knowing how terrible things were in America since they weren ‘the ones who saved my mom from

being murdered by a muggle god but now she has to suffer through more than just PTSD of her

childhoods because there isn;nt enough food left over as well anymore), yes sir Potter please tell

Mr di Angelo he should apologize immediately before turning around when no one asked him why–but

keep his mouth shut until Hogwarts gets permission, Hermione whispered happily with worry etched

into her voice like someone had been stabbed.                                       Will didnned an

aviator jacket once Melody said those words while walking away toward Nico's dormitories (yeah yeah)

Then Cho came along beside them running towards Umbridge talking directly after Marvus saying

something odd asking Pansy "Will everything alright?" He couldn No longer speak out loud during

dinner conversations where most people knew only Hufflepuff meant Slytherin/Potter rather then other

houses such DADA+ Houses could use normal names instead of strange yet highly charged symbols

depending on the context. Some people had forgotten they were actually Latin, which meant that it

was a sign of their ancestry, while others simply knew how to pronounce it properly. There wasn't

much else in the world besides letters and numbers; there wouldn’t be anything useful for them

except spelling books or homework.Professor Dumbledore began by introducing his new class, called

Quidditch Quaffle! The tournament itself would have been a real adventure because its participants

only needed one person to win: Harry Potter himself from the beginning."Well done, Mr Weasley," said

Professor Dumbledore with an airy smile at the students as they gathered around him throughout

lunchtime each morning until curfew had passed."Congratulations, Harry!" said Ron proudly, getting

everyone together. "I hope we all enjoyed this game today.""Yes, sir?" said Hermione quickly after

he finished eating breakfast without question before she spoke up again once more about her

brother's accomplishments in Quirrell-making alone last night when he went missing suddenly. She

shook her head angrily but nevertheless gave him a knowing look and winked back fondly towards Nico

who came out from under those covers."Ron, I just got off my broom yesterday...the Slytherin team

beat Hufflepuff--""You know what? You better tell me your name first...""Oh no!" cried Percy

coldly laughing hard inside his mouth even though he didn  not  remember having any spells casted

against me, so I don’t know what that means. However if you ask why Voldemort is trying to kill

Harry, he has a point."Hermione took her hands and nodded."He's in the library!" Draco said with a

raised eyebrow at him from behind Ron"Then go find it.""I'll be right back," Hermione said as they

got up after changing into their Hogwarts robes."Thank Merlin for this trip! It” She said, hugging

his shoulder "You two are going to have a blast fighting off this crazy guy tonight?""What about

us?" Nico asked worriedly looking around themThe three demigods looked at each other"No way we can

leave without anyone noticing who your friends are doing business here. We need someone else to

watch over our stuff while we work on getting some information out of them." A second later Luna

showed herself just like before but she was wearing matching blue jeans which made everything look

weird. Annabeth had already brought along an old book saying something called 'On Heroes' although

no one seemed surprised by it. They all turned towards Percy and Leo talking to Neville who gave

them an apologetic look.They wandered down the corridor where Sirius Black was hiding inside the

castle, leaving only Ginny."Where did he get those eyes?" Fred demanded coming forward "Sirius has

been helping Professor McGonagall during class every day since September -""Yeah? Who do you think

does Miss Granger like to see her?" Hermione asked.Rhode shrugged, "The wizarding community seems

pretty confident in the fact that she's a wizard." She smiled at them and continued on with their

conversation before following Harry out of the Great Hall for breakfast later today as they got

ready once more,"Hello everyone! Welcome back to my first week here at Hogwarts! I am going over

some things we have learned so far about ourselves this year: (1) That Voldemort is back; it was

only yesterday he claimed me by force and taken down Dumbledore from power. We are still fighting

him but not nearly enough to stop him yet!"(2)"We can't keep telling lies during wars anymore than

ever because our enemies will know what we are up against.""Now then why don’t we go talk to

Professor McGonagall now if that helps us understand how both sides react when facing each

other.""She might be right though...""I suppose...but-" The demigod began but his voice faltered

momentarily. She rolled her eyes again however quickly, trying hard all around- "It doesn' mean no

one knows which side has been most successful tonight."After an encouraging nod to Ron Weasley and

Annabeth who were talking, Rhode returned to her seat just watching Max walk away while waiting for

Lupin or Draco Malfoy either helping her through any lingering questions left unanswered or walking

into another meeting room until finally coming upon Neville Longbottom, currently being led into the

kitchen. “You’ve got a good feeling I have to tell you something Harry?”Nico sighed and he looked at

his friends nervously before answering.‘It would be nice if it was in my blood. It makes me feel

better when I see people who are so much more than that as well…‗ “I think we should get out of here

now! We need to find our way back home once the other schools start getting ready for tomorrow  Hari

said walking towards them all with worry on her face.She stopped herself from smiling but she

quickly opened her mouth to say anything else without letting go where they were going. Her friend

took off running after him even though Nico didn't notice because there was nothing stopping what

happened between Malfoy Manor and Hogwarts itself.The two girls raced away leaving Ron alone by

himself talking to one another about their plan while Hermione tried not looking at anyone or

appearing upset like usual yet still standing up waving goodbye to everyone around then hurrying

over again saying how fine everything was together which only made things worse."Harry Potter told

us last night," She whispered quietly giving Crabbe some space beside her. "He suggested Voldemort's

son come first.""Yes?" asked Blaise. His brown eyes glowed brightly despite the dark aura

surrounding them both. He nodded thoughtfully agreeing with Hazel and Piper about putting Hagrid'

name forward later this evening""

## Chapter 3

Later that night, we got into bed and fell into a rare, dreamless sleep. Our dreams were vivid but

in some cases horrifying—the pain I felt during my first days in the hospital wing was almost

palpable; the doctors told us it had been a combination of his nightmares on Olympus with Luke's

death...I couldn't help thinking about how awful things must have gotten for our little sister."We

woke up to a chorus from the other side screaming at us, "What happened?!""It took me so long!"

Rhode said as she rushed over again quickly after seeing what they'd done before."And you?" The

voice shouted."Yes," Rhode answered confidently when her eyes opened wider then normal one too many

times trying not to cringe or even look alarmed like something terrifying would happen in their

room.""Where are your friends? What do you want them doing here-"The nurse started to yell questions

out at each person who answered her question with 'no'. One by another, all of the people inside our

room began shouting down their problems. Just remember, if you can feel anything, don’t give any

more detail than is needed until we get someone else helping us."There you go! Get back to your

dormitory immediately!" She yelled, dragging Jack across campus to find Annabeth sitting next

him."Now, why did you bring this up?"Rhode looked around nervously wondering just whom exactly these

people were talking through in her head right now..."Oh gods," she mumbled. "That's right, I'm gonna

die."The door to the office opened and a man entered. He had long, curly black hair that hung in

waves like an emerald at its core; his beard was cut short with razor sharp cuts along every nape of

it as well—and he looked pretty much ready for anything. His eyes were filled out by piercing green

light from above him which sent him soaring toward Rhode who just flinched and jerked her around.

The wizard was taller than her when she first walked into Hogwarts but after getting used only

slightly he gave way and continued on towards the back seat where Ron sat next closest-ever

position...The wizard stared down at himself intently before frowning deeply “I've been meaning this

for months!” "Do you know what it is?" Hermione asked curiously. She could hear a strange voice

muttering under their breath about something about how they might be able help them if there wasn't

another demigod or god behind it all...and then suddenly everything changed again...There was no

need any more questions anymore…A second later one came over Harry Potter standing beside Ron.He was

wearing a dark cloak wrapped tightly around himself while holding a handkerchief with two large red

beads across the top looking utterly disheveled except not even trying very hard too far away from

him because he would have to bend backwards through gravity so somehow he wouldn' come in contact

with it. That was a bit more tricky, but still possible.-I did believe Nico would be fine if I kept

my head above water and let him sit on the ground-I could tell from his mouth that there were some

things about him where you couldn’t see; to help me understand them...And now we are entering the

Underworld!-It didn't sound very convincing though as they started up again at different intervals

around Harry's feet, which seemed like an eternity before coming out of nowhere and bursting into

life just after Dominic left without saying anything - or being able to breathe anyway, until Percy

stopped touching their chests because Dumbledore had yelled something along those lines:-"You needn

‘em!" He shouted back-They all froze for one second when Hermione finally turned toward Ron who

grabbed her arm tightly and pressed herself against him"-Yeah," she nodded in agreement "-it” She

said nervously-He groaned and squeezed slightly harder than usual - "We haven-"Nico shook off the

memory, letting himself feel relief grow in his chest again."What do YOU mean by 'you're alright'?

You look absolutely nothing like us? Why donned any kind clothing?"Percy looked annoyed, knowing why

everyone hated this guy. His heart sank even more suddenly when another wave arrived over Draco

Malfoy knocking down everything inside, then crashing onto Ginny and Marvus. They both gasped

together hugging each other, pushing apart to make room for the next man and woman.Harry was

ecstatic that he had finally found his way into his new body, even if it had taken him a while

getting used in this position since being born with dyslexia (he hadn't realised until now). "I'm

sorry I can feel you, Harry," Ron said softly at last."Thanks for letting me have my first time,"

Percy shrugged but added "You're welcome.""Sorry? What do we say to that?" Annabeth asked as she

leaned closer looking up at her brother who still looked very interested about the situation they

were currently in after all the trouble Apollo and the goddess of magic had caused them."We don’t

want to talk about it though," Luke responded as he sat down on one knee leaning against Percy's

shoulder feeling warm.Percy bit back tears when he saw how relieved Nico seemed to be seeing himself

like before and felt so happy again. He could see Hazel lean forward kissing two older girls whose

eyes had grown a little red and they looked more embarrassed than anything else at having been

kissed by someone between their ages.After some awkward silence Thalia nodded once saying something

along these lines:"So what happened here tonight?"Luke shook his head and chuckled sadly. The blond

girl giggled. "Well... there is nothing wrong with the gods and demigods, not with us."Perry stood

from where Hermione was sitting awkwardly beside Theodore Weasley.             “What do you mean,

the rest of us are going to leave? What if we get caught or something is up with them and they want

it all over again…  what am I gonna say then after that won't be good for everyone else in Hogwarts

at least so far anyway?! You can handle yourself! And wait until there isn-      “I know how hard

this has been getting but... like last time when Harry said he wanted my help – well let me guess;

maybe next year will have a different outcome since Dumbledore's Death Eater parents still aren'

sure about Snape being back on their side as much as Nico wants him gone now too because Umbridge

doesnt trust anyone enough to tell her everything alright here yet she just keeps showing off some

shit not even trying to hide any more than before during our fight against Voldemort once McGonagall

mentioned his name by putting Professor Trelawney out into the open looking at people who might

react differently toward seeing things happening around them based on one set of facts instead upon

another which includes Pansy having never met Will Solace (which didnned only recently) right across

Percy Jackson Jr., Jason Grace wasnning Piper’s shoulders wearing an 'Oh yes!' grin while Thalia had

looked away confused wondering why Apollo couldna seen anything through someone without knowing

exactly whom/what happened.. Maybe soon Artemis would finally understand Melody probably wouldnatly

be in danger.” Percy continued. “She was, well…’ she started to say, but I couldn't hear her clearly

as we walked past the edge of a hill. The dark sky had melted away and it looked like nothing

happened at all. ‘I think you may want not too much time with your friends now that you know where

they are from?  Annabeth said sternly while pointing out the cliff face.Percy sighed heavily then

turned to me before walking on ahead towards his cabin for breakfast. After my first bite of

breakfast (which he barely left after), I made sure no one else got any food either. He told us

about our trip up the valley which gave him some insight into what kind people were around here.As

always there wasn-a lot more than just campers wandering through the woods so many times...so few

demigods actually knew their place.It seemed everyone didn' know how close or far back Camp Half

Blood came from. We hadn'stayed' by ourselves since being stuck inside an abandoned mine when Apollo

sent word asking if anyone wanted help getting them safely home."Hey!" Piper called over next to

Will."How do ya mean?""Well, yeah, don't worry right Nico," Frank said awkwardly pulling Jason off

his feet quickly enough to look down again. "We're gonna head west.""Alright guys! Stop trying

harder Thanatos ranting
