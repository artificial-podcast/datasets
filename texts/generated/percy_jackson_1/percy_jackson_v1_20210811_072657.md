'They both fell back onto the blanket and his palm came to rest on one of her breasts'

## Chapter 1

They both fell back onto the blanket and his palm came to rest on one of her breasts, her face

buried into it. She didn’t say anything as she waited for Hermione then went down to the ground, “I

think I know what you are doing here.”             Hermione glared at them but before they could

respond with a response Melody stood up from behind Harry, leaning forward in front while looking

away when he looked around toward Will… until finally Nico let go of hers... Tracey watched him too

closely once more; yet again confused that there was only Umbridge standing near Marvus during all

of this time alone so far? Though some wondered why Pansy still wasn't having any problems getting

rid of their homework or other things like that because now suddenly even if everyone else had

gotten together enough people were going to be out walking by right next to eachother instead of

hanging over Hari's bed!  No wonder no matter how hard Professor Snape tried not come after Daphne

got tired every day since dinner (even without being careful). Only yesterday did Dumbledore tell

Cho something about those days which should have been easy answered easily already knowing just who

would blame anyone except Draco Malfoy today-or probably later tonight anyway – mostly Mrs Weasley

himself causing chaos amongst Gryffindors everywhere…. And guess where is my little brother sitting

beside me?!                     Oh shit isn-- oh fuck yes– OH MY GOD, screamed Ginny screaming

through pure horror: “YOU ARE NOT MY HERO!” (OotP)The three of them tried to hide as the two boys

took in the scene. Hermione saw Ron and Harry being tortured by their captors. The rest were just

standing there with wands out towards them when someone started running toward them. ‘Harry, get on

over here! Get off him! I want him locked up for life! It doesn't matter if you kill this guy! He’s

going home now. He didn  not need his captor to make a move or to call people names; he needed the

peace that had been built up between them all. But then it was time again."You alright?" Percy asked

Nico, who was already at Percy's side. "I know what happened last night. We don-""We're okay,"

Annabeth said, holding her breath tightly but trying hard too much even harder than usual before her

hand went into Leo Valdez' chest pocket which kept falling up until she pulled it out from under

Nico".What did you do? And why are you-" She closed her eyes tight against Percy so he could focus

once more.""I ran away because I wanted to fight Voldemort, but...""When we got back together!"

Piper called after them without any hesitation beside herself.They both turned to look around

confused and terrified while still looking at each other worriedly one way only they knew better.

“This is our first time in a long while, and this has been tricky work for you all. We’ve had to

keep on trying for hours now - because we are going through difficult situations that require more

than just us to solve them!” Draco looked at his friends as if he was some kind of wizarding

monster; there were always monsters lurking around the grounds of Hogwarts. Harry wasn't sure what

type but Malfoy seemed relieved by their progress. They both noticed Nico staring at Hermione with

interest. He glanced back over towards Annabeth and then Ron who nodded when it became clear where

everyone was going. For once, no matter how hard they tried...Nico stopped short before looking down

into Hermione's eyes again thinking about everything she said. She didn' think any spells could be

broken out of her mind during a spell casting period like hers would have allowed. When someone

casted the Patronus Charm onto his wand he felt something move behind him as well…The thought had

never crossed Percy‘s lips until tonight so far, but seeing Granger suddenly appear unimpressed

after being trapped here made things worse...Hermione scowled and shook her head. This was not

normal for anyone outside Hogwarts anymore. Everything must've changed since last year or else

Voldemort will find another way to get past Gryffindor. And even though Dumbledore told McGonagall

earlier today that Umbridge couldn- she should have known better than to let him go

alone.               As if it wasn’t enough, Snape felt a surge of anger rise in his chest and he

shook himself away from the scene at Hogwarts as well... He was about to turn back once more when

Hermione came into view… Melody ran over with her hands on Harry‘s shoulder like they were trying

not get caught up too fast (or something). It could have been worse for them both since their

meeting last night; however, now that all would be said there wouldn't even need an excuse why some

things weren “bad” anymore! That means everything is going to end much sooner or later  Nico thought

bitterly while looking down upon everyone who had died just before Draco entered Gryffindors Common

Room this morning: Ron, Ginny Weasley, Neville Longbottom, Sirius Black, Cedric Diggory, Blaise

Zabini, Theo di Angelo, Ron Weasley and Marvus Shacklebolt. All three Slytherins stood around

watching one another calmly but clearly looked pissed off by what happened tonight instead thinking

quickly until McGonagall interrupted rather easily due only because most students didn?t seem

bothered after being dragged out so early without warning yet still talking amongst themselves among

ourselves?!   Why do you think I can look bad during dinner time? They asked each other angrily

behind Dumbledore's back then began hurrying past Will Millicent Parkinson The pair walked for a bit

before Ron came running in with the rest of the Gryffindors.             “Nico di Angelo, what are

you doing here? I mean... like we were just going to go and spend time together during break… You

know all those things that happen between us when your friends don't want to get into trouble

anymore after something bad happened or whatever it is.. It's not my fault he could have done so

much more than me now without asking them too many questions! Why amI being on edge right about

this?! Nico should've known better then to make excuses because some people would say anything was

wrong if they saw him walking around Hogwarts as someone who looked evil while others simply couldn-

                         “Uh oh yeah come join Harry Potter at our dormitories later tonight; his

one last day outside school until further notice," Blaise said brightly waving an arm toward

Hermione Granger sitting next To be continued … Continue Reading "The world seemed to forget how

awful everything had been yesterday…" What did Voldemort do today night...? More Than Just A Dream

By James McGonagall (translated) So far there has only been two Americans found dead by accident:

Cedric Diggory and Ronald Weasley. Most likely death itself due either from serious injuries taken

away earlier against their parents' wishes or pure luck alone. As well Death Eaters arenned yet

another attack such as Malfoy killing Sirius.” He continued, “What I don't understand is why he

would choose to go with the Death Eaters instead of Voldemort and how will this new threat affect

him or his family in general? There are people who knew me back at Camp so they know what it means

for us that we can protect each other when there's a chance! Dumbledore has already told them about

our plan but now if Harry wants to take over Hogwarts then you must allow your friends around here.

So even though most of my followers have been killed by the Ministry before, Snape might not be able

either. It won' make things more difficult because any students on the ground may die within days;

children from certain schools could lose their parents too. And since all demigods should still

abide by their oaths under the Cruciatus Curse, wizards need to be taught proper fighting

skills.-Draco sighed as he took one last sip after taking off his cap which had fallen onto

Hermione-He let out a groan and turned towards her, muttering under his breath:-I'll keep asking

questions until someone gives me an answerSo Draco was trying very hard right through his head to

get everything sorted into order without much success till Umbridge asked some stupid question (And

Ron didn...) she'd said something awful like 'you're going to break down these walls whilst

protecting Slytherin'; somehow mum and dad got up early enough to tell everyone anything else

## Chapter 2

They both fell back onto the blanket and his palm came to rest on one of her breasts, making Nico

smile at her as she gave him a small kiss. “So..it’s been so long since I have seen you like this?

You always seem very private about things, right?” He shrugged. Hermione took that for a moment

before looking over again in amusement. She nodded. Percy rolled his eyes but didn't say anything

else until they had reached an empty bed and sat down there, staring up at the ceiling for quite

some time while he tried not look at himself or make eye contact with anyone. Finally, Harry awoke

quietly beside them; though it was slightly uncomfortable now because Neville wasn- Sirius Black

just appeared out of the corner oatmeal eating a cupcake from the plate (which Dumbledore hadn--he

asked Ron if nothing happened). Once all the food finally settled into their hands Harry got ready

and stood next di Angelo. His face was paled before something else hit everyone's lips... ‘Mum told

me my date needs a good night‗ George spoke calmly behind Dean who continued speaking through

clenched teeth. Soon enough everybody saw what Fred and George were saying when they looked around

wildly getting more confused by how well Professor McGonagall seemed off. When no words could be

spoken then Umbridge turned toward Jason and muttered under her breath that everything must turn out

ok after dinner tonight… It would only take two days later Will decided to see where Draco and his

friends were heading for Christmas. As they walked down the street he noticed that many people had

been following them around, especially Harry Potter. The streets seemed deserted but at least most

of it was empty. “I don’t know how long you guys are gone… I mean what do we need? We should head

back home or something if no one is there in a while!” He smiled as Nico came up behind him with

Hermione. Both girls glanced over towards each other before looking away quickly leaving Annabeth

and Percy alone after watching all of their movements. They turned on Sirius who nodded once

agreeing not only did she have some time left when her quest finally ended due to the mysterious

disappearance without notice. She sighed sadly knowing this would be her last day here since coming

from a magical family. Though obviously going into hiding wasn't really wise either because having

everyone take turns pretending to protect your friend might just get lucky rather than kill those

few wizards out there hoping nobody will find them. It took five minutes though so Jason got Ginny

together along side McGonagall making sure none more escaped yet managed sneak past Malfoy himself

talking to Ron about keeping an eye on Lucius right now even casting a Patronus charm whilst running

through the crowd trying desperately still getting under way by Molly Weasley screaming "Auburn!"

which caused Umbridge's wand-waving to go off like crazy and causing others nearby Hogwarts

students' wands being sent flying.The only reason for it was that they were not in the right house

to be talking about this now.It was a nice sight, but Neville had his own problem with this aspect

of Dumbledore's office (and he wouldn't let anyone else do that). He heard some whispers from inside

and felt rather curious as to what exactly happened next. It was clear something was off going on

here, if just because someone is quiet couldn’t mean anything.He sighed as he reached out towards

Nico di Angelo...it had been nearly ten minutes since Snape called him back by telling everyone all

Umbridge would be there tonight at dinner."Nico!" said Professor McGonagall, looking very confused

"What? What are you doing?""I don  know," she replied quietly still staring into the distance like

Hermione was trying her best somehow impossible-""What did you see?!" asked Ron angrily standing up

straight behind them both."That guy attacked me again..." Harry pointedly snapped between his

fingers in frustration."Oh gods! Stop insulting my cousin.""Why can  I speak to your friend later!?"

yelled Sirius, while grinning widely. The rest followed suit quickly enough though whispering voices

rippled throughout the castle making sure no one could hear everything so far except Severus himself

who looked quite relieved over the whole situation as well......Just then another door opened around

themselves which led them inside via hallway under Hagrid where even more people began screaming

their agreement loudly. When she saw Nico, it was obvious he wasn’t happy with them and that all of

his friends were too upset to agree because they had never thought about how much the demigods meant

to him in those first few years. She could see some of her other classmates shoving others away from

Harry after Ron tried yelling at Snape for saying something stupid or asking if someone else would

come along who didn't understand why no one looked up until now?            Nico rolled off onto

Blaise as well; mostly just looking miserable over Will's lacklustre behavior toward Draco… And

there weren ‘others'?         The Slytherin girl turned around back towards Umbridge when Melody

moved forward again making Pansy jump out a little faster on top of Marvus before falling down next

to Millicent causing another group hug between both girls – this time only Tracey holding hands so

far together instead  being careful not hitting each other harshly but also purposely avoiding eye

contact during conversation since neither Hermione nor Daphne liked seeing what happened (except by

doing stuff like trying different things) yet getting smacked upside-down everywhere once every two

minutes…. Yet still nothing new! Oh wait you donned your Auror robes then did I do?! Well yes quite

literally everything already except maybe my wand which is pretty useless without charmspeak

included... Though unlike Divination anyways most spells have an actual effect upon whether you cast

them or not. It's just that wizards are so smart they don't know how to properly use the

Mist." "They're getting better, isn’t it?" Rhode asked as she looked around at her friends before

nodding in agreement with Harry and Ron who were already looking over their shoulder at the water

they had collected from a nearby lake on top of where they'd been strolling out of Hogwarts Tower.

"As long I'm staying here there won' be no problem. Especially since we can go back tomorrow night

for breakfast instead if anyone asks." She told them cheerfully causing Hermione even more

excited. The demigods all stared down at each other amused but still curious about what was going

through Nico di Angelo”You think he“s gay? Do Heiligen Frey look like him?‪Nico nodded his head

sheepishly “Yeah honestly this is probably the biggest misunderstanding ever put forward by

Dumbledore right now  The only reason why people aren taunting me into saying anything else today

would simply make us uncomfortable.""I heard everyone talking," said Annabeth, grinning widely at

some pretty impressive looks coming from both boys whose cheeks did swell up a bit. ‘I thought maybe

when Luke came home because nobody knew until later… How could things get any worse... What do I say

anyway?!"Rhode smiled brightly at those two while Su let out a little groan at one point as he made

his way over and hugged her tightly.“It's okay, I just have to take care of myself for the day so I

don't get sick or anything like that. Please tell me what you think about this new information after

everything we've gone through together. I know it’s not going to be easy but...I mean...what else is

there to do?”Her face fell into an expressionless frown before she answered, ‘Well, if you're

feeling any better then go on ahead with your plans now that I got done here. After all, people can

always change their mind when it comes time they wake up from sleep. That was definitely something

Rhode and Lee were willing in case things went south again during their travels back home.The

daughter-in law decided quickly enough that she didn' need much reminding herself of that day

either. She had been trying hard since school started even before getting stuck in Grimmauld place

every summer while waiting outside Hogwarts library. It was nice though because unlike past summers,

no matter how bad her nerves sometimes seemed wrong…it wasn  anymore! They finally calmed down once

more which meant she knew exactly where to start whenever needed without worrying too much."Good

morning," said Lee kindly as they walked around the common room. He smiled widely at the other girls

who were standing by them whispering quietly behind him. "So Harry Potter has gotten himself

involved?""Oh yeah

## Chapter 3

They both fell back onto the blanket and his palm came to rest on one of her breasts.The moment

Percy had been able to pull himself from his knees, it was gone but he still felt a bit more relaxed

than before."What is it?" Annabeth asked him quietly as they sat down at their table with Nico, Will

for a little bit longer while she listened in between them"It's an unusual thing.""Well," said Draco

seriously "I haven't seen this happen often enough...but I do know you've got something special

going here.""Yes?" He said. "You're my sister right? And all those people who see me like that have

lost everything.""That makes sense..." Harry began hesitantly."I'm not sure how much weight we lose

off the ground after so many years. My mum died when I hit puberty, and by the time I went through

life together everyone else has taken it off themselves; although some think I did too - or maybe

just changed into clothes because there were a lot fewer things to wear during pregnancy-""And if

your parents weren’t famous then why are they always known around the world so easily? I guess most

of us would be able explain what happened behind our backs without sounding ridiculous. Or at least

making assumptions about how powerful they could really get!"Nico shook his head, no doubt

remembering exactly where Hades had put these words."You don' want anyone to feel hurt again! It

wasn all  mine last year. And I feel so guilty, like it's my fault for not trying. Like, until

now..." "I knew that you could do this," Nico said quietly and tried to sound inconsolable but his

voice was so quiet he didn't have time."But...but no one else is going through this anymore. Not me,

not in the slightest.""That makes sense," Will replied and there was a rush of worry. He had been

saying things about what happened with Bianca before they arrived at Hogwarts; she would never let

him be alone without another word or thought--and maybe once we were all together on the other side

these feelings wouldn’t change.Will just looked away, letting go as though nothing would happen."So?

What are you planning?""To make sure Hermione gets back home safely after getting those lessons from

Voldemort," Harry answered bluntly, his tone showing concern rather than malice. "She will need to

get some rest-"Nico frowned. The boy must know something horrible has been happening right here at

camp.The demigod shook himself off and stopped walking towards Dumbledore Tower where he stood

awkwardly looking over them while talking beside Cedric Diggory who was standing nearby watching

nervously between the two boys staring at each others and shaking their heads. Then suddenly an

awful crunch came out near Umbridge and then everyone started screaming loudly inside the castle. At

least three people fell into line (three more died) and each one went to the front of a queue. But

neither camp was happy about it, so Percy didn’t show up until nearly six in his morning.He had

already been through four demigods before; he couldn't be sure how many were coming from Camp Half-

Blood; if they wanted to speak with him, then this would suffice: Nico di Angelo and Will Solace.

The two older kids seemed less interested than ever, but at least for now he was getting along

alright without their disapproving looks."Well," Apollo said to Frank as everyone else began filling

their trunks on either side tables and sitting around them all by himself while everybody started

asking questions that came out of nowhere. "I can help you get ready.""Yeah!" Leo shouted back as

someone walked over and grabbed Jason's hand."Jason! What happened?""Nothing really, just

tiredness," Piper interrupted loudly. Then she turned toward Annabeth who shook her head clearly not

liking the way things played out.Percy nodded. He took another sip after Hazel asked some friendly

words like ‘not too far away, ok?”The boy looked relieved when Reyna gave him an amused smile."Yeah,

I guess we should hurry here first thing in the morning tomorrow or something... And meet me there

again later--""Okay, fine..." With those final few words, Chiron called off what could have only

gone well beyond dinner. As the two of them talked, Percy kept his head down and focused on a small

area around Nico’s bed where he had fallen asleep before having to wake up from the dream. He was

alone in the dorm with Will Solace after curfew ended for now, watching Harry Potter get put in

Azkaban as part punishment for being found guilty by Umbridge. The other students were more than

happy that they didn't know who their boss was anymore; Ginny Weasley would be furious if anyone saw

her or she wouldn't stop asking questions about it… “Do you think my life is gonna turn out

alright?” Ron asked sarcastically at one point while Hermione whined back into her thoughts. After

getting some sleep this morning (as per usual) Annabeth went off to go find everyone else when

Daphne came over which turned out not too long later there was actually no way Apollo knew how many

people got demigods trapped inside an orphanage during the war until Professor McGonagall showed him

all sorts... They then headed upstairs towards the Great Hall trying desperately whether to hear

Dumbledore speak directly instead Of course we did! What happened next shocked me because I hadn-

And just so happen to already see Dominic talking to Draco Malfoy whilst someone tried calling Lupin

home saying something nasty About why Snape needed help but told us exactly nothing But alas none

seemed quite right yet Cho Chang decided to listen rather politely Bellatrix Lestrange, daughter of

Poseidon. The young witch had long since lost her temper and lashed out at the older demigoddess for

taking a life threatening shot in front more than once, including when she'd tried not only on

Quirrell but also Percy Jackson as well."What?" Annabeth said annoyed as she stared at Hermione with

wide eyes that clearly weren't looking away from them all day...and suddenly she was surrounded by

angry people running towards her.At least they seemed happy about it.Annabeth could see Thalia's

face in their eyes as if watching something happen to someone. But then again she wasn’t exactly

sure what would happen after…well, maybe this morning or some other time....but whatever. She

hadn to decide yet.-Thalia, how many times have you heard anyone say ‘I can”? I mean, most of us are

pretty good at expressing ourselves (if we don' want attention) -""Well, let‗s hope no one asks any

more questions now," Grover muttered and started walking off into another world where he still

couldn  care less who asked him whether he wanted his girlfriend back......the fact is, there were

plenty going around Hogwarts today. Sure there actually did seem like an uptick between Umbridge

being forced shut down and everyone getting detention ordered along side Dumbledore and Snape, which

meant fewer students got expelled over the summer, especially Hufflepuff Ravenclaw. He didn’t think

that would be a problem in their future year; they had no idea where Nico was going or why he ended

up with so many things to do. If anything his family felt more at home in Italy than anywhere

else.He sighed as it came to realizing what Dumbledore told him about di Angelo. The son of Hades

hoped for the best and everything Will did around them wasn't expected out-of--and not right. What

if Harry could somehow get some answers?The Headmaster just sat back as Frank explained... "What

exactly happened?""I don' know," said Hermione nervously, "but I'm sure your sister has found

something she likes." They were silent again when Professor McGonagall asked - most likely from

Snape's comments on the upcoming feast before dinner (which only got louder) — who'd brought Mi into

the infirmary after Umbridge made her first public comment against Umbrage earlier this morning… And

then Draco Malfoy himself stood next door—looking rather amused by his little outburst toward one

Gryffindor girl: “You are both perfectly fine, Miss Granger! You have been very brave today, indeed

you deserve everything you”...And everyone gasped together now, trying desperately – but failing

terribly–to hold back the tears.  She stared at Percy, while Annabeth‘s face became frozen clear….

Even Hazel Potter blinked away any doubt which was brewing inside
