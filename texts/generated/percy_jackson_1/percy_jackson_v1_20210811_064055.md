'We were supposed to meet a guy named Hagrid, who Chiron had warned us beforehand was a half-giant'

## Chapter 1

We were supposed to meet a guy named Hagrid, who Chiron had warned us beforehand was a half-

giant." The son of Hades said quietly. "Yes?""I'm sorry about that," Nico apologized and

nodded. There was an awkward silence for some time before he spoke again: “So you're saying we have

a history with giants?”Nico blinked once, then nodded in agreement as he looked at the ceiling above

him; it was dark out, but filled only by the faint light from the torches overhead—"Yeah. I know

there are giants on Olympus now...but they weren't my first encounter.""You don' think so?" Percy

asked cautiously."No, not at all..." Annabeth said simply enough just to reassure her friend

properly she was right. She pointed towards one corner where another group seemed assembled…even

though no one else was up. That moment when she could hear Jason talking to Cho Chang caused

Hermione's heart rate meter monitor automatically going down. And even if Dumbledore wasnned back to

health (and didnning his cloak), Harry's aura of power couldn not seem like anything anyone expected

or wanted them doing.Hermione sighed loudly while Draco looked ready himself off—as well other

demigods around him waiting patiently in front along their path between Camp Half Blood grounds

whilst everyone else continued walking forward. As soon after those two groups left, however

unintentional this might be, Ginny turned to see Granger leaning against the wall behind them. She

looked up at her, like she was ready for something serious."Who are you?""I'm Ron Weasley," Hermione

said cheerfully and opened her mouth once more but nothing came out except a couple of squeaks from

Hari and Neville's face as they were still trying not find anything in their food that matched their

description.""You sure? You know what that is!"Harry raised his eyebrows in confusion."It sounds

kinder than I thought it would be," Nico answered with an amused smile."That's enough for now,"

Harry muttered before walking over towards Hagrid who stopped right on edge by the door.Hari grabbed

hold of Draco’s arm pulling him close to him then stood there stunned. "What happened?!" she asked

concernedly sounding confused about all this stuff going down around her head."Nothing...nothing!"

he snapped back angrily just as Professor McGonagall stepped into their midst and started talking

about everything - only stopping when Malfoy pulled away again looking terrified.Hermione blushed

faintly at seeing Dumbledore standing next turn staring at one Gryffindor table. It didn't take long

until everyone else had gathered together and sat across from each other holding hands tightly. A

few people laughed hysterically while others nodded approvingly knowing exactly what we were

doing."We need some answers soon! This time will do wonders for the future of Hogwarts!! And don'

forget, no matter what happens, stay safe!!" "Oh yeah," said Hermione. "I'll be back soon." She

stood and walked out of the room. Nico's eyes widened in shock at seeing her. He didn't need to

thank Will for that, he needed his friend back. They went down a dark path into Gryffindor Tower

where they met up with Albus Dumbledore, who was still having lunch when Harry called him over from

Diagon Alley. When it became clear there wasn’t enough time to talk about anything other than

Hogwarts School Wars… Voldemort finally managed some kind words during the meal before taking off

again. The only problem was, as far as Hades knew (and Percy suspected) none of them had spoken

since Umbridge decided not all students were welcome anymore... Well, just like how Ares did then -

even if Apollo thought so - but apparently after she left Camp Jupiter last year? That meant their

new Headmaster couldn ‘see through people” or something... It got worse by the second day; Ron ran

away immediately following Hagrid“s orders!  yelled Scorpius, dragging Hedwig across the corridor

toward the Ministry building. Hari stumbled forward quickly trying every thing she could think to

get past everyone else. But whatever, nothing happened except the two girls being watched closely by

Professor Snape. Hogsmeade ended abruptly upon finding both teachers working together to protect

themselves. Even though everybody on the grounds now seemed completely subdued, I was happy to see

that our friends were quiet. As always, we had a group of people meeting us at some point in the

evening after dinner. “How are you guys doing?” Ron asked and Harry replied, ‘I'm fine with having

more sleep when it comes time for Quidditch practice today. They won't have enough extra hours left

until tomorrow so they'll probably shadowtravel from America back to London as soon then or

something like this.’ Nico didn' think about what he said before his face cleared and nodded slowly.

"Yeah… alright," Hermione agreed quickly, her eyes narrowing slightly. She looked up at me with an

amused smile but made no move towards speaking again. That night, Ginny and Luna started getting

nervous around each other and would sometimes try snogging one another while sitting side by sides

just looking at each others faces. At first, my mood turned sour because there wasn-“Ron! Are you

okay? You look really confused right now. It's almost curfew anyway. How is everything going?" A

young blonde boy who only appeared five years older than me began asking questions once she got

close (probably three). The younger girl sat next him on our couch waiting patiently for someone

else not yet here to ask them too much trouble already since everyone knew how important their

answers could be if anything went wrong. Not all of these boys responded well either; instead, most

demigods were hesitant to fight them.               “I am still upset about it and I think that

would be a good thing for Harry if we could keep him safe from Voldemort in the beginning of his

term as Minister, but... maybe they can come back together with Nico again? Maybe there is more than

one way forward… If he has someone who will protect me so that this whole year isn't ruined by

another war or something like that…. What do you say then--no matter what happens between us next

time around?! It wouldn'be nice if Cedric didn- Ugh! No problem buddy! That's not even fair!! The

only reason why Umbridge said she doesn ‘t want her students here today now,' was because Snape told

Dumbledore how much better things are without Dominic being attacked somehow – especially after all

those years on the run at Hogwarts where many people died duelessly while trying their best despite

no help whatsoever–       So far neither Daphne nor Millicent have shown any signs of wanting to

leave school alive since McGonagall left last night (even when Ron mentioned Quidditch yesterday),

which makes sense considering Hermione had been looking into everything lately too: Slytherin versus

Hufflepuff going up against Ravenclaw both before Pansy started getting anemic during dinner hours

earlier, Professor Sprout having some bad news later learning Fred wasnnastier himself over

lunchtime just days ago, even though he was busy with his schedule. He still hadn't had time to

spend the day alone in a classroom when he asked Professor Snape why Hagrid didn’t appear at all

this morning as usual and got an answer from the Headmaster immediately after

dinner.             And yet… Dumbledore could see that it wasn  anything like what Harry wanted him

back for now...      What happened? Hermione thought of how Will Solace said something about being

good friends, maybe they would come together someday or soon enough if Nico is alive. The way

everything seemed to be going on lately made her conflicted between wanting them both happy- which

she knew there were more reasons than one but none really mattered right away since those feelings

weren____________________ HUFFLEPUFF DRAWNUTS AND QUARTERBACK SITUATION             As everyone

began their breakfast break eating out Pansy ran up beside Draco; scowling (no doubt under some

duress) “What do you mean by 'dinner'?! This isn--what are we doing here! Why did I have such an

important conversation today!? You know nothing can ruin my moods other than watching your face burn

while listening intently......Oh wait donned robes arenTracey told us where Umbridge's office is

located so then shouldno ever need to go through Hogwarts again!! And besides ugh nevermind not

having classes tomorrow night anyway no

## Chapter 2

We were supposed to meet a guy named Hagrid, who Chiron had warned us beforehand was a half-giant.

We got here by train but he ran off and we chased him until we found Hagdrid. I ended up helping him

carry the guy over so that we could go back to camp." Nico said. "But it's not like you can talk

with your siblings about Camp Half Blood.""He would have been fine if I didn't come along," Hermione

said as they continued on their way to the castle from the village."Well, all of them should be able

take care of themselves in time for dinner tonight at breakfast or something." Will shrugged.Nico

gave his friend an awkward smile. He wanted to ask why Ron wasn’t there after school early this

morning when Harry left because Dumbledore came right behind her waiting for them to arrive before

she went into Hogwarts.  "I'm sure what happened last night is still under investigation though

since my parents don ‘really want me coming home anytime soon. But just think how many people might

have died during those terrible spells! I mean, even Voldemort escaped one year ago without any

Death Eaters around!" Annabeth smiled at Percy and grinned too much while saying that Malfoy Manor

House was next door.They walked down to where Snape stood staring down at a pile of books piled high

with information about Voldemort lying dead on top which only served further proof that Voldemort

couldn' possibly kill anyone except himself. They both looked at each other, before sighing and

hugging as they were put into the carriage. “There’s a girl that” Nico muttered in disgust while

Annabeth gave him an approving nod. After about ten minutes of quiet conversation Harry finally

spoke up. He smiled fondly towards Nico. The demigod nodded and then started walking toward them,

hoping to catch sight with Hermione or Ron when he was alone again. ~o~O~o When Percy arrived on his

doorstep it quickly turned red. It had been months since I last saw her though she seemed absolutely

adorable and had just finished reading some books for us all. She said something to me after we got

back from the trip down memory lane but kept ignoring me until now. I tried calling out where our

cabins would be tomorrow night so hopefully there won't have any problems getting you through the

day anyways. This is my first time visiting this house yet; why bother? My only reason to visit here

has always simply come because I'm tired of waiting outside every single week. So today's date will

probably be extra busy which means not having much fun during the holidays too. Though one thing

Will Solace didnned yesterday morning wasn--he left without saying goodbye either. But if anything,

tonight may mean even more stuff happening around Hogwarts! Despite being away most nights (aka

practicing Occlumency) Umbridge still didn care enough regarding your classes anymore. Well, you can

take a break and rest up for now." Nico said with a little bit of hope in his voice.               

Harry wasn’t sure if he wanted to hear the same thing again or not after having spent so much time

worrying about it since they had started this whole mess last year… Yet she was still there; her

mind telling him that everything seemed fine despite what Ron told Sirius earlier today: how

terrible things were going from their meeting at Hogsmeade yesterday (not as bad without Blaise) but

worse than any other day could be when Umbridge would talk incessantly into Melody's ear like some

kindling! Even more concerning then all those horrible memories Snape got out during one of Draco”s

detention sessions ever taking away most of people who cared.             That afternoon Hermione

went through Will “I think I should do something else too though," She paused reading until once

Dumbledore appeared behind them toward Cho Chang on Divination class instead of sitting down next

door while Professor Sprout stood by side looking amused even further ahead trying very hard not

come off as upset over whatever happened around us leaving Hagrid alone... "Nico?" He asked quietly

before leaning back slightly smiling brightly onto my shoulder reassuringly just walking forward

slowly against the wall- oh no gods we need someone really important here? And why did McGonagall

look confused right afterward saying 'We aren't allowed'?! It wasn’t until I looked up that I

realised what was going on. “Look at me, my little sister, how could you even possibly have been

such a monster? How can you be so stupid as to think your children are monsters and not just real

ones? You were born into a society where there is no one protecting them from the ravages of evil,

yet all monsters claim themselves equal in this world?" "What?!" Ron yelled back at him. "I-!

My-!"Harry huffed and ran over to Hermione who still hadnshed out her explanation about why they

weren–""Why did you say it like that?" asked Harry nervously."Because," said Hermione hesitantly

before she pointed at Nico with interest—who gave an amused laugh under his breath but then nodded

once more—"Because…you're really here because we need help…" He trailed off, unsure if he should or

not.Hermione shook her head angrily while Ron seemed unfazed by everything. Once again showing

sympathy for Percy however...he didn--and Draco had only gotten worse when their father tried

threatening Mum against Malfoy Manor first. When Granger got angry enough (or cursed) her anger

morphed between wanting revenge on both the Malfoy parents; being afraid too much and having to

fight Voldemort himself; guilting herself through sheer willpower that she couldn  do anything right

now.And finally, when Draco started yelling things toward Harry's face—he quickly followed.“It is a

part of the Ministry that you would not like to be associated with, Potter?” He demanded.Percy’s

head snapped up and he just stared at him for a few seconds before answering; ‘Do we really need

proof from Dumbledore about what happened yesterday or can I make sure she doesn't know who this

person was until it becomes too late? Or could they go back in time and find out where these people

went so fast? What if Nico somehow tricked me into thinking Snape had sent them there because he

knew someone else made them do it? Who knows why Percy didnned his invisibility cloak only to have

Ginny get hurt instead... It all seemed hopeless!Harry glared at her angrily as tears fell down his

cheeks but never forgot how much he loved Will Solace. For once alone again--and even then his voice

was hollow beneath its cold weight."I guess your parents were right," Hermione said softly, smiling

widely at the couple sitting next Ron on their bedside table after dinner over breakfast last night

while Thalia sat beside her looking around nervously. "I don  think anyone ever told us anything

important.""Why did you stay?""We couldn-""Oh Merlin! You weren-" She looked away from Ron trying

desperately vainly keep an eye open. “I wasn. I mean… I've been crying since my first birthday, I

haven t thought about it.” Nico said softly.               He has to go back home and find Will…

That's what he needs?      Pansy frowned as she looked at the other girl who was starting to walk

towards her trunk again in front of them with a frown on both sides. It wasn't that they werenned

out from their homework (after all why did Umbridge keep putting those people up for this?) but now

we were going into DADA! How can anyone help me when there are so many problems happening right

outside our control?! The thought sunk deeper inside Tracey “I don- Okay wait an hour or two before

you tell us about your new quest... Do you want some answers?" She asked nervously looking around

where Millicent had left off after seeing Marvus leave earlier today just getting more confused by

his surroundings than anything else ever could because everyone seemed to be forgetting everything

except him once instead of remembering something important like how Hades wanted Dominic gone too

since Blaise came here yesterday only taking Harry away then leaving without even asking if

Zacharias is still alive anymore either way will always seem impossible during normal time making

sure no one finds themselves needing explanations every single day being constantly reminded never

to do any quests over dinner yet anyway......             Her head dropped onto Ron next to hers

while Melody followed behind together not wanting another demigod detention until Easter break

already having been waiting patiently across town

## Chapter 3

We were supposed to meet a guy named Hagrid, who Chiron had warned us beforehand was a half-giant. I

think he's the one that took my sword." Nico frowned. "You're right, it seems like he’s been here

all along.""A Half Giant?""Yeah," Rhode shrugged. She didn't know what she meant by giants but...

"He said that his father is Kronos and, well…he could be Greek." The son of Poseidon looked back at

her with wide eyes as though trying not tell her something important."And why would Hecate want you?

You don' know how much power this guy has over the world?"Nico shook his head in frustration for a

moment before answering quickly: "...and Olympus itself; gods have no magic."Rhode nodded. Then she

added another question about Athena herself:"So Luke went off on him last night while we were

waiting for your help, did he attack me or are you just messing around now after everything

happened? It seemed like the situation was getting worse from there being more incidents than

good..."Rhue blushed hard despite himself even as her hand tightened on an object beside her neck

holding up two hands nervously - one made out Chinese pearls, both of which hung loosely above her

waistline saying 'Sapphire Sapphire'."They've got their own affairs!" Su said with concern glaring

at them expectantly as they continued to get into the room. The other demigods frowned, but found

they didn’t need to be told that their friends were going to spend time with them in private and had

plans for when we would come back home again soon. We went on our way towards Camp Half-Blood, where

a few of us met up at the Hog's Head table as well."Where are you?” Harry asked hopefully.We all

looked over each others' shoulders and I could tell from his expression that he was still worried

about Nico. The two boys seemed like good people because they talked so much and listened to me,

which made it easier than ever before - even if some people really needed to know everything there

just wasn't enough space or food around here yet.When Percy stepped out of the Great Hall line of

students rushed after him saying that no one else noticed who this kid was; nobody wanted any

information either. If anyone saw what sort person she stood next behind my head instead now knowing

exactly whom her friend was, then everyone will say something along those lines."Hey," Ron said

awkwardly pulling Ginny closer together. "You okay?"She nodded slowly."I'm fine," She whispered

softly.Percy gave Hermione an encouraging smile and took another deep breath despite not wanting

anything further off topic.He walked down the hall looking excitedly at everybody except Piper whose

eyes hadnned both men closely while Annabeth only kept her distance."Are you sure Chiron is

alright?""Yeah," Thalia agreed. "What do we need to know about him? Are the demigods really that

bad, or are they just one giant step ahead of us and going crazy with our plans."Hermione was

stunned by this revelation for a moment before she nodded at her friend who nodded in agreement as

well although it took time until Hermione could understand why his face had changed.After walking

through a few hallways slowly Harry began pacing around Hogwarts. His wandless aura filling up

everything in their path but nothing too bad. When he finally reached an empty corridor towards

Hagrid's hut where everyone stood looking at him with wide eyes he smiled sheepishly at them both

then walked back into Gryffindor Tower. The next day brought another set piece news which excited

Ron so much that when Nico woke from sleep on Friday night after breakfast knowing exactly what

happened Voldemort would soon be out of power within three days (assuming only Percy knew),

Professor Umbridge came running over to discuss something important between Dumbledore & McGonagall.

She even gave Annabeth some new ideas! That morning though...Percy noticed Draco Malfoy trying

desperately not to get caught off guard whenever anyone asked questions like 'what does Peeves

want'? He also didn't seem bothered while Snape looked furious all night long causing no end

effect.When Dean arrived shortly afterward Daphne and Millicent were laughing hysterically telling

stories whilst Jason and Seamus waved goodbye saying things such either as: 'I'll always be grateful

to you, I'm a big fan of your work' or something similar. Harry was the one who mentioned that he

would give them an invite back for Christmas Break this year so they didn't have to wait long at

least until then."Ron asked why Dumbledore had just agreed to let him join up with his NEWTS after

their first meeting in September but Rhode shrugged it off thinking about what happened since she

could only dream all day like Hermione did when Nico saw her coming out of bed"You're both lucky!

You got demigod friends!" Ron exclaimed cheerily waving me over hoping someone else wouldn’t

overhear my question before walking away into the common room eating some chicken from two puddings

sitting on the floor by myself enjoying a good meal while we waited for our friend to come

down,"Come along if you want, son of Hades.""Yeah thanks mate." He smiled getting us talking again

"Let's go see where there are people going?" Ginny stated looking around heading towards the small

lake near the Slytherin tower "Hazel is waiting? Maybe donning a new cloak during summer break""Nah

no not yet Chiron told me how much time goes by though right now anyways should probably get changed

later tonight  do you guys know anything interesting enough?"We nodded once more making sure we were

safe inside even considering Luke leaving early too (he said nothing). When Hazel arrived in the

office, he gave her a hug and asked her to get ready for breakfast. Nico’s smile vanished as she had

no idea what was going on but kept an eye out for any sign of trouble or bad guys around.XXHe

dropped his stuff at 7:30 pm heading back into the castle so they could do their homework before

dinner when Will found him glaring up from his textbooks while Percy watched with interest Harry

Potter sit down next door. “What were you doing today?” He stated hesitantly getting off Draco‘s bed

and headed upstairs thinking about something that Hermione wanted him not to know until later

tonight. The two boys fell asleep almost instantly though; both seemed to be looking forward towards

tomorrow night.They ate lunch together after talking over Dumbledore‬s speech then went downstairs

during the first day of term to see Sirius Black outside Hogwarts which will take place this

year…and it wasn't good news either because all three students would never come home again...When

Jason left yesterday morning having already packed some things away alongside Professor Umbridge․s

papers there was one last thing Remus told them instead since Snape didn-wasn--eaten several times

by now just waiting patiently under the covers asking questions only to hear stories like di Angelo

telling someone else how terrible Voldemort was, Neville breaking Dudley‡s arm without even

realizing who put it, Dean coming inside every five minutes wanting to talk about what the hell had

happened. He couldn’t help but feel guilty for being so oblivious as he watched him walk out of the

room with a cold smile on his face. He walked back into Umbridge's office and stepped onto the desk

opposite Professor McGonagall before walking through the door that led to the common room and up the

stairs towards the Great Hall where she was waiting for Harry Potter.                  Melody didn't

say anything! Why am I in this mood? She doesn- why is there an invisibility spell...     Oh wait…

only one person did answer her earlier after all; Dumbledore himself (which probably wasn

“Dumbledore said something bad because we weren' allowed to enter Hogwarts without permission or

explanation)? And if they are going somewhere else then by Hades cabin now anyway.. oh Nico would

never believe me when my powers came from someone who created them just like Draco does right here

at Camp Jupiter! We're not even supposed-"             The son/daughter stared down across the table

confused until Snape stopped talking: "So you were wondering how your Patronus works?" Pansy frowned

thoughtfully looking away thinking ahead."This can be used against anyone," Marvus answered calmly,

giving everyone good reason. Even Ron could see Will doing some weird stuff since no matter which

way Daphne looked behind their Veil Cloak will always take its hit.""That sounds great!" Cedric

cried
