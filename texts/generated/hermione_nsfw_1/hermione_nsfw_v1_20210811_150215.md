'She looked under the sheets and saw that she was naked'

## Chapter 1

She looked under the sheets and saw that she was naked. She started to cry in her sleep and ran from

his bedroom, reaching for her arm."Shh, Harry! It's okay," Ron whispered as he pulled himself up off

of Hermione to go check on her sleeping form. "I'm fine.""It's alright?""Yeah, I'll be with you

tonight then. If you don't mind me asking if you can get some food at the kitchen before we leave?

You know how much it takes to put all your stuff away like that so no one would think you left there

alone after going through everything.""Why not?" Harry asked. He wanted to do this without Draco

touching him or causing a rift between them. Harry knew why they had gone back into hiding things-

secrets were dangerous. Maybe once their relationship grew stronger, maybe someday he could talk to

Ron about something else."Harry, please!" she begged when he kissed her again but stopped just long

enough until he reached down and touched her hand against hers instead..."Hermione, look where I've

been hurting my feelings already. Just...just touch yourself now more." Harry moaned, rubbing his

hands over her thigh. It didn’t take too long for the anger to rise inside her. The pain in them was

overwhelming; Hermione was barely able even thinking clearly while she cried out every time he did

this little thing to make her feel better and hurt her, making her want to snap herself apart. When

she finally got it up, it was as if she could hear the sound of a clanging. She wasn’t sure why she

was looking at him now but it felt like he was watching her too so quickly and it made sense why he

wanted more than anything else right now since they both knew that they couldn't do anything about

this. He didnÕt seem like one for messing with anyone in his life anymore. Just like Hermione that

night when Ron left her room expecting some sort duels or something. This was all kinda weird

considering how much Harry had grown into the man who had been killing people without question over

the years. Still though...it seemed odd, even for him. It was strange enough that he only just

started to notice Fred then again because there were no other men around until recently anyway.

There was still plenty out there waiting for them which meant Ginny probably thought otherwise being

alone would be easier said than done on their own regardless. But after what he did to her tonight,

I don Øm not surprised by your reaction either. His behavior is definitely different from mine

however. What does it make you think? You know me well! And Merlin knows where everyone gets off

talking shit lately sometimes-You are exactly my type “Ginny Weasley: I see…you must have noticed an

improvement every time we talked last week Mrs Sandore heard us discussing our upcoming Triwizard

Tournament event; perhaps you could join us for lunch?” Draco shakes his head. “No, but I love that

we have all the time in my life to enjoy ourselves… and there are plenty of other people here who

would be willing."I smile at him as he brings his hand over her mouth with a soft, amused smile on

it – not to mention their very public presence at Hogwarts today! He chuckles lightly when she looks

at me again before glancing away from Hermione's hands once again while he kisses his way down her

arms (still smiling) along side mine: "You really don't need an excuse? You know, to feel

comfortable talking about your adventures?" Draco sighs, somewhat awkwardly kissing my cheek softly

against hers which was becoming more and less affectionate every day now.Draco moves closer to my

earline slightly after they've discussed what to say next, then leans forward so close to kiss both

of us passionately without breaking eye contact or even moving one finger between us right until

deep breathy moans escaping each of them;"Oh yes…" We quietly moan together through the distance

separating us two. Draco pulls back just long enough for Granger to reach up under my skirt above my

hips where she comfortably folds into the hem of her shorts making her breasts appear visible

beneath the material. Her words were quite loud too - definitely sounding like a high octave female

voice outside Hogwarts' walls... 'Please'.We can only imagine what our parents were like, but for

some reason I've wanted to make you cry all the time."I was unable not to let my anger show and so

did Pansy.She giggled at that too as she said things about how they didn't even know who her father

really was anymore then before when Sirius had told me he'd left us with a group of friends because

his family wasn’t real- "So...""Donna? Are your mother still alive?" She asked while rubbing around

Rhayden's back where it touched him deeply in places from which no one else could see.""That

wasn—Rh-" He started again hesitating slightly;"What?!" Her voice got louder than usual due probably

more blood pressure or something similar!"Oh gods! What is going on between two Slytherins?! Where

are their fathers!? And why do people keep telling them we're being here now if nothing has changed

since coming into this world?? It scared Lucius enough already though; oh well just wait till next

week," Hermione tried pulling herself up onto Harry by grabbing hers tightly across both shoulders

until Dobby stepped closer taking care of everything together making sure everyone knew exactly

anything needed to be done instead leaving without saying another word out loud causing neither

Malfoy nor Luna to give any response either way""Harry will figure somethings through later huh?",

Neville replied looking over towards Draco sitting opposite Narcissa holding hands against each

other trying hard

## Chapter 2

She looked under the sheets and saw that she was naked, looking beautiful in her bra. He grabbed her

hips so he could kiss her deeply."You're sexy," Hermione moaned as she felt him press his tongue

into one of hers while pressing down on them. She let out a groan when he brought back some of

himself for good measure."Yes," he murmured against her mouth."I like it tonight," she replied with

a smirk before pulling away from him to face him again – still wearing her underwear – kissing him

passionately. The sound made Draco feel like burning the candle inside - or maybe just wanting this

too much.  That thought also ignited the fire in their hearts: Hermione had an orgasm! What if they

were both having orgasms? Or would it be enough pressure now only to make them climax more

frequently?  Their bodies were reacting differently at every turn, each trying its best not get

caught up in any fight...  This wasn't what they'd been planning since last week!  They hadn’t

realised until Wednesday morning exactly how far along they‘d come.By then all bets were off. It

would be two weeks later today, December 31st. They both lay asleep by Merlinric's Law without a

word spoken… or anything else said; Ron was sleeping next to Harry and Ginny whilst Hermione was

laying across the bed.They snuggled together comfortably but kept their eyes locked on sleep over

breakfast. After three hours spent sitting between two people who shared a bed, it was time to move

onto the next topic of discussion. Hermione’s parents had been very upset when she had returned to

Hogwarts from her summer abroad and she was worried that they would have more trouble getting out of

their home because Snape had asked her to stay in his room for just one night until he got back up

(he didn't even bother to say anything). She hadnÕt meant any harm to anyone by leaving them behind

at all, but now that she knew what they were going through there wasn?t something she could control.

How did Ron know about this?? It was as if someone else was making him believe that Harry couldn¬ve

possibly heard or seen how much she hated him… And yet then he realized where she really stood. Ron

knew exactly what she wanted with him: Someone sweetly innocent enough not only loved Ginny Weasley

like everyone expected her; maybe Ron was secretly jealous of Fleur Delacour so badly... maybe he

was just being naïve and didn?ll be right again.? He shook his head, trying hard  to keep from

laughing, knowing that nothing would come of this conversation. He glanced around the room, hoping

no one would notice anymore than the students that looked about. Everyone seemed rather quiet,

although some sniggered loudly under Sirius's questioning gaze and some merely shrugged quietly into

silence. All eyes on Dumbledore, though probably less interested himself since he was almost certain

that Harry would never see him again. He only smiled at the older wizard and his lips curled up into

a small smile."I think we all know what happened today.""Harry's not going to believe this," Pansy

interjected. "He said something about killing me before I could ask for help or anything like that.

And now it's clear how much you've fallen in love with him too.""Why?""Pans.""That is true.""You're

right after everything else she has told you over the years-""Well, there are times when I have been

jealous of her sometimes too," Moody chuckled as Luna laughed back loudly. 'She did say once where

they were arguing together afterwards.'Luna got so turned on by these memories that she practically

shouted out words against them both while Dobby tried repeatedly making sure no one noticed just

yet. She should be grateful any more than everyone had forgotten who my friend truly looked down

upon those two days ago. The last time Voldemort claimed Hermione Granger was dead...Dobby also went

through some of the things Lavender kept saying during that brief encounter (in front most likely

because people didn't want to hear anyone talking). If even half of their friends knew why Professor

McGonagall called Snape an idiot earlier, then maybe someone somewhere must've realized exactly

which girl Lestrange apparently thought might actually have died..."And finally: When Malfoy came

crashing home from the lake, Hermione and Draco followed him into his bedroom.  They were silent for

a while as he stared at her with unreadable eyes before looking back to their friends who had come

over for dinner. “I think we should leave now,” Ron said softly after sipping on whiskey when she

opened up one of those fancy glasses of firewhiskey that they were sharing and took it.  She glanced

up and saw them, both still in shock by how utterly brilliant Harry was going about doing things. He

looked positively adorable, but even more than that… well.. he really did look like an idiot!  And

this man hadn't just insulted Harry Potter yet... he also insulted Hermione Granger herself.

Suddenly all thoughts began racing through Ginny's head. How could Ron have done that?  This was not

something that Harry had ever experienced or thought about himself. The events leading towards

Dumbledore having taken place months before seemed so ridiculous and impossible that she actually

wondered if there was anything else out there beyond such nonsense- and then the fact remained--

‘He’s right, Harry!' Hermione whispered against Theo Weasley because the redhead seemed rather

shocked by what had happened. Ron sat down next Neville Longbottom and ran over to see Luna Lovegood

sitting in front of Theodore Nott in Gryffindor Tower trying desperately hard to convince himself

that he wasnÕt stupid enough nor mean enough (because no matter which way you

## Chapter 3

She looked under the sheets and saw that she was naked underneath him. He had his hand in her arse,

he pulled it down slowly on top of hers. She moaned against him as he took his cock into himself

while he fucked her ass with ease."What? Just...just...""You want me to stop?"He nodded again before

plunging inside of her quickly. "Fuck you so good," he groaned when her legs wrapped around his

waist and started pumping harder than ever."Oh God yes!" she cried out between thrusts.His hands

went straight to Hermione's hips and grasped them tightly at once. Hermione let out a scream of

pleasure which made him pull back slightly but not hard enough for him just to fuck her until her

orgasm hit. Draco pushed deeper still using every inch from her pussy to her clit, pulling deep even

more deeply now by pushing farther all over herself without letting go.He reached up lightly and

began to rub circles along her core where he could feel her walls clenching together behind him,

only to be stopped abruptly because of the incredible pressure coming from him."Fuck! Oh gods - oh

god Merlin I'm going to cum", she whimpered then clenched tighter onto the bed next to him causing

him great pain and need within her. His fingers were running through her hair making her gasp

loudly;"Please don't come yet darling, please-""Don’t try that or else we will lose both our minds

forever alright?", he warned her.  She sighed and closed her eyes, but she didn't want to disturb

him anymore.   "I'm glad you said no", he replied to the question. “It's okay now we can talk about

it later."  Hermione nodded in understanding as she stood up from bed on Saturday evening, taking a

seat at an empty table with her wand between them before walking out of Hogwarts. Ron sat next his

twin's room for dinner when they arrived back home that night. He knew how Ginny was feeling after

Harry's death, and wondered if they had just come by here together; or were still friends?  It

seemed odd that they hadn’t spent time together during their second year at Hogwarts… His heart

nearly stopped beating once more...  If he could only live two lifetimes without seeing another, he

thought. ~*~**~~** On Monday morning (Sunday) Molly Weasley got ready for work early enough for her

scheduled day off so that she could head home late into Sunday afternoon to restock the bank. The

baby shower needed some serious cleaning up – even if Fred and George werenÕt planning anything

really fancy (that they couldn), so Molly opted not take any chances with Hermione while she

prepared herself for the next day shift. Having done her due diligence on preparing, packing all

ingredients used inside Ministry stores recently - she decided this would be safe-keeping for sure.

They sent Hermione owls every few days, asking if they had anything in particular to say. He didn't

know what to think about it; he was just so tired of hearing her complain that he couldn’t help but

feel guilty. It was a bit embarrassing really, that she'd been more than happy with her answer. She

always said something like ‘if you can count on me, I will be fine without him!” and Harry didnÕt

see why the girl couldn Ðve. The fact his sister made his stomach crawl at being seen as such an

insensitive prat meant that everything was falling apart. In other words – well… Everything.

Hermione sat down on one elbow next Ron who looked completely lost. Ron had put his hands on either

side Draco too by now - the two wizards were sharing a chuckle since Hermione was sitting right

beside them, hugging him tightly as Ron put one hand on top again while looking between their

friends trying not only understand each others emotions yet keeping eye contact, or at least

avoiding them altogether entirely, although neither of those ideas ever crossed his mind. “I don¬m

sorry? Why do we have this conversation? We haven-Ò – “You wouldnitarryo!!‵ You could tell our story

because Malfoy still seems to want us all alone together. That is exactly what everyone has told you

before and you are going into hiding from your parents tonight...” “I can promise you that,’

Dumbledore said as he gave Harry a reassuring smile and turned to the small group of Aurors. ‘It―s

all my fault now that I have been in Azkaban for so long. You know it is my job first; make sure no

one sees me! If there was ever anyone who would be watching this, they would always tell us what

happened at Hogwarts or about the Cruciatus curse, but most people don't realize how important that

part really is, especially with all their families around them being under constant surveillance.

What we were told doesnÒt matter anymore. We will not allow any other Death Eater to gain access to

our homes again. And if some Death Eaters try anything against us, then everyone knows why: because

everything has changed since Voldemort came back… But stay strong - keep these bastards out of my

way, okay? They won-—‘This time isn t-to be taken lightly, please, get up – wait until Draco finds

you, alright?!– Hermione cried triumphantly, shoving her hands down her face before she could say

more.'Get off of this place,' Dumbledore instructed.Hermione nodded and took his hand in hers while

the others held on tight together just long enough (Harry hadn¬t heard yet). She started walking

towards him cautiously, never looking away when she finally found him
