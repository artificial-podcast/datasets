'She could be very bossy, but that was nothing compared to the Mistress she became'

## Chapter 1

She could be very bossy, but that was nothing compared to the Mistress she became. She did not need

any help from anyone in this world who would care about her.Hermione’s heart sank as she realized

how much more important it had been for her than any of those other men and boys. The one man she

loved so dearly on such short notice; Draco Malfoy! He wasn't there to steal her away or harm her,

he just walked by like a shadow, always on guard with Hermione Granger every day until dinner time

came around again- his presence made everything feel as if they were out hunting a pack

animal.-Draco Malfoy – I know what you're talking about… it's not your fault we didn?t have a chance

at success tonight… I don!? As is my responsibility!!- Her voice went wild, causing Draco almost

instantly overthinking himself. It seems he hadnÕt really thought of this long before– “Yes Master

Harry Potter sir.. please forgive me for being late today, miss Parkinson please excuse my absence,

I can speak with you later when needed! Thank You Headmaster Dumbledore, and Mistress Pansiness

Healer Weasley- Oh yes Master Ronald Lestrange Sir…. Please leave now Mistress Augusta Fudge cannot

stand hearing of your loss, Miss Grace Bones Mistress Macdolas must seek medical assistance whilst

Ms Malfoys needs rest Mister Darcy has sustained a severe head injury… please allow your departed

husband an hour alone to recover, and I would be delighted if you agreed.” “I will, Sir; but please

tell me why you left?’ Draco asked as he gathered up his robes in one hand while holding Hermione's

arms out for her release when she turned around just enough that the older wizard could see through

them without looking at him directly again before they Apparated away from Gryffindor Tower on their

own accord into a different part of London after curfew had passed with little more than screaming

shouting obscenities over it all once Malfoy returned home. When they arrived at Hogwarts in the

morning Harry was still nursing a nervous smile despite not knowing what Dumbledore had been

planning next for the day so far: everything was going well, though there were several possible

outcomes by then… A rather large portion (if only briefly) seemed satisfied with the progress

Dumbledore made towards securing justice for Hermione Granger who'd been murdered years ago during

Operation Acromantula—and some of those outcomes clearly came down slightly today due wholly or

partially because Voldemort and Regulus hadn't yet been able to stop murdering dementors outright.

But even this small piece remained stubbornly stubborn until finally Dumbledore nodded his head

reluctantly to change his mind. He couldnÕt say whether any other people would accept such leniency

given how close things had already become with regards both sides regarding Avance-related issues.

Only a handful knew exactly what they should do about defending Hermione against whatever was

bothering her.  He had to know, and he needed it. She'd been the one who threatened him during their

first meeting, but she hadn't said anything. “What did you just say?” Harry asked as his face turned

a bright shade of red. They both knew that Ron would have gotten up if only for them being in this

room alone together with Ginny at all hours when there were many other people around school--

especially those not in Gryffindor Tower trying desperately hard on preventing an attack. Maybe it

wasnÕt so much that George Weasley really was an idiot, nor perhaps he actually thought something

like that. It certainly didnt seem any less infuriating to read such language in front someone as

Remus Lupin than it would be lying in bed right now. As much fun or stupid thing he could think off

doing back then came from him talking dirty while he made jokes himself. And even though he found it

amusing to hear Fred joke about it every time he heard Sirius snort out loud under James's breath,

it didn  come close enough anymore since Neville seemed more interested by having sex with Tonks

instead. But anyway! For once, he wanted to stop thinking about how awful it must feel to see Luna

sitting next door listening intently while Ron took a deep breath. His eyes searched his friend

until finally seeing a light purple blur across his vision before turning to look away. “Hey, I know

you’re here because I said something to your sister that you really need some help with and she saw

it happen in the hallway. She was terrified of coming back from Grimmauld Place. You should have

seen what happened to her there.”Hermione nodded slowly at him but continued down the hall towards

Sirius's office where Remus had sat watching the Daily Prophet whilst Sirius kept an eye on Harry as

he was still asleep, having tried not to wake up too early after all his school work. The room was

silent for a moment then suddenly Sirius turned around to face them. He looked very much like a

snake, rather large and muscular except for his long black beard hanging over his head. His eyes

were blue and red and bright green irises giving off the warm grey colour they usually had when

living together.Snape narrowed his eyes slightly while standing next Severus Snape almost looking

like he wanted to escape death itself."Severus?"Remus glanced sideways between them quickly finding

himself staring directly into his brother's eyes which were wide with shock. It was odd how young

people never seemed so calm during such a volatile situation…"Sirius, did anyone see this? Just by

chance…was someone actually attacking my cousin?!"The man stopped talking immediately making sure no

one else heard or noticed,"Oh yes! We are quite close now-""I am sorry Sev…""No problem mate. How do

we

## Chapter 2

She could be very bossy, but that was nothing compared to the Mistress she became. He couldn't

believe he even had a mistress in his life and it wasn’t just her, or her children- not only was

there no way she could have been the wife of this man who wanted him so badly for her...it didnÕt

matter what happened between them. It just mattered how much she loved him at times like these! How

he loved her as if being with another woman were some sorta guarantee they were destined together in

heaven. Hermione turned back around quickly, only when she saw Harry holding her hand did Hermione

realize why she was standing here before him. She smiled at Ron over one shoulder as she pulled

herself up off Draco. The Slytherin sat down next door followed by Ginny from their classes.

Hermione took notice as Ron started taking notes on everything going on in Hogwarts right now while

she got ready for work. “Come join us,” said Ron softly, not wanting anyone else knowing about his

new assignment. His eyes wandered across students nervously, looking for signs that someone might be

waiting for him; however nothing came out except those two grinning ear firsts which seemed eager

enough anyway. There appeared suddenly an idea in Hermione's mind that made things easier as the

boys began talking to each other without really bothering her. Ron went through all of his

assignments after lunch almost instantly. They spent most days learning spells against each others

hands and feet.” “I will keep my word, Potter… but I need you to come back with me as soon we can.

Your presence will be needed in the coming days; if not sooner. We may not have a way of reaching

her yet,’ Harry said quietly. ‘If not later, perhaps when she finds out where this is going. I do

wish it were possible for us both that she could find peace after what happened last night at

Hogwarts.''I know,' Draco smiled. He turned his eyes on Hermione again before asking, 'Should I tell

Granger about this? If I should say no, why would I want them there?'Harry shook his head and waved

his hand dismissively.'You are welcome to stay until we get into contact with each other, Malfoy...

or shall we? You won't ever feel safe here either, unless we require you elsewhere. To protect

yourself from the inevitable attacks, one should never expect anything less from your husband. Not

even that,' he continued softly.Hermione nodded and then stopped walking towards him. She looked up

from her book and Harry did the same. A moment later they heard voices descending through the

corridor so suddenly their heads spun together in dread.Harry had two bags under the table by Ron's

side: one for himself (which was full) while Ginny left him with his parents' wands. It felt like

the very end came first because Hermione knew only what he was capable of. “You’re not supposed to

be doing this, are you? You could have been a Death Eater and saved us all from being destroyed by

your own stupidity! You should just get over yourself,” Ron said bitterly as he looked at Harry in

shock again… ‘cause if it hadn't come crashing down his throat... well… that would probably never

happen either. He had no choice but kill Dumbledore now or face death today for messing up things

like that with Voldemort. But then there were also many other people out there who might be willing

even more power to do it. They wouldnÕt hesitate to use their magic on someone they didn¬t want them

dead for something like this anymore than anyone else. And maybe knowing about how bad it can

actually go caused some problems so don Ð think I havenât put enough effort in already. So damn

Granger- I shouldnnÔt expect her too much happiness when she is here. She has done nothing wrong

since we left Hogwarts and knows exactly why. No one wants me having sex right after my birthday

party anyway so give me another chance before next year. Oh yeah wait listen Ginny Weasley will tell

everyone tomorrow night;  Charlie Weasley:  Yes. What good does it have to keep those Muggles alive

while still remaining free until Halloween weekend.? It really doesn(?) sound fun though eh?

Especially considering George told her that if he was going to be a dad, she should have at least

some idea of what they were really like. He’d never admit that to anyone else before, and there was

no way in hell Ginny would let him see it. “Yes! I will do my best Harry - I promise! Please don't

cry yourself into oblivion until you are ready!” She smiled brightly as she helped him stand up from

the bed and slipped off his broom-stick, tossing it on its side. Ron sat upright again when Hermione

walked by. She reached out for one leg to help hold him steady, but didnÕt get enough. Her hand

pressed gently against Draco's arm while pressing hard on both sides with their own breaths coming

in short bursts. The brunette looked down at himself through widened eyes, clearly not expecting to

see this. It wasn¬t much longer before Fred stood stock still, standing slightly back so his head

rested over hers instead; Hermione watched him closely. His pale skin covered everything from his

hairline straight across his chest (where once all blond curls had gone), plus the bumps at base

which still formed just above his jaw line right where Hermione guessed were his molars... which

made it obvious who he actually belonged here now because he seemed unimpressed or annoyed with

himself. All the while knowing exactly how miserable he sounded. Not even close to being able say

anything about it

## Chapter 3

She could be very bossy, but that was nothing compared to the Mistress she became."I'm sorry I

haven't seen you before," Hermione said with a small smile. "Besides… what are you looking for?""A

book of my choice," he replied. He gave her a quick hug and kissed her again as she looked at him in

confusion.Draco pulled back from their embrace, his head dropping into an awkward silence between

them."What do we have here? Can it go anywhere?" He asked hesitantly as they made their way down the

hall towards Hogwarts Tower where many witches were gathered for dinner.Hermione smiled at Draco's

answer without a second thought; she couldn’t afford another lecture on wizarding etiquette

regarding guests. The last thing she wanted right now lay upon Malfoy Manor – not even the old

castle itself would hold the promise anymore than this one had been years ago! What if he didnÕt

want me there? What about him already knowing all of this about us?! Her thoughts raced across every

single thought she felt floating around in front both sides: how wonderful this place truly is

indeed beautiful by any definition - and why wouldn Ôn expect me once more like home? Why donning

Gryffindor robes, Granger turned up on the seventh floor balcony overlooking Platform 9B after being

given two very long days alone, when no sooner did she realise she wasn¬teaching herself or

McGonagall the rules - nor did anyone else in the school. He didn't want to be seen with her by

Dumbledore, so he was all alone. The other teachers were probably going to wait for him outside and

watch his reactions as he stood there silently reading from a book."I'm sorry I couldn’t tell you

what's wrong," Harry said quietly after finishing one of their potions lessons at lunch. "I donÕt

think it was my fault that Snape kept giving me detention.""Well, she doesn Ðn know why we sent

someone out here this early on," Tonks scoffed.Harry just shrugged awkwardly before saying, “He knew

too much about our past that they never admitted. As long ago or later when he found out how badly

off most people are sometimes. It wasn¬t even until recently though, but Hermione told me something

very important once Ron asked if Remus was okay. Apparently, things have changed since then. We both

became better together more often. And now... well, maybe not completely yet but definitely between

them. They feel alike, apart? You really need time! What do you mean?""And who knows where Sirius is

anymore?" Ginny chuckled."You can bet!" Harry replied snidely. She turned back to Neville and looked

up into his eyes with such a sad smile. "'Mione has been studying hard lately. Her new class seems

quite nice. Plus her parents haven't shown anything strange towards girl since they were married.

The boy that went to Hogwarts last year has not even hinted at dating anyone other than Harry, but

he hasn’t been a friend of hers either. But she doesnÕt have any friends in the Slytherin common

room and Draco can see why. He thinks it was because Ron and Hermione weren¬t there when he did this

for Ginny on Sunday morning. And yet again, he wants more than that. Maybe next time he can find

some way back out into his life without being hunted down by Voldemort. "You know what?" She asks

quietly as she makes herself comfortable with him leaning over Pansy Ð sheÓs getting used too much

before she becomes really mature enough about them anymore."I think I could handle it," says Granger

softly after a moment passes where they all look at eachother confused.A few minutes later Luna is

sitting in front of their dormitories, eating a breakfast made from scratch while trying desperately

unsuccessfully so far against tears that pool on top if they are alone.The raven-haired girl is

waiting for them outside the door until they get dressed. It isn  pretty obvious who's wearing it

now. Hermione tries looking away but finds nothing inside. Luna leans forward and kisses Hermione

slowly moving between them both.Hermione feels her cheeks heating up slightly which causes Pawnee –

or Weasley -to catch her eye. “I don’t know… I guess, maybe not in the sense of having a way to talk

about it… but you must know that there was something going on with him and he thought you were a

murderer who deserved some sorta revenge. Well yeah fine, we‘ll get through this alright.” Hermione

looked at Harry apprehensively as he continued his explanation without blinking back tears or even

looking at them again until she had finished and cleared her throat once more before looking back up

and smiling softly into Draco's deep blue eyes.'What do they want?' she asked.'To kill me,' Draco

said. 'And then throw me out like—'She frowned when he interrupted her sentence because he wasn't

sure what else could possibly make her feel better. He couldnÕt say anything right now and neither

could she, not really. His heart stopped for just one moment from the look across their faces

together before racing down to meet hers.Her lips curled slightly under pressure and she let go

slowly, swallowing hard. Draco pulled away quickly and stared at himself sadly, staring at whatever

life lay ahead inside all those years ago behind closed doors; the empty hope still floating around

in every inch where nothing had ever been born.He pushed open his mouth and smiled inwardly at

herself. But here... Here she sat, face buried between two stone walls as if drowning,

waiting."Hermione Granger," Narcissa Malfoy murmured into an arm
