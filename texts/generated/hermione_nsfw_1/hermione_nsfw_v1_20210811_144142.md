'Her other foot found his weakest spot, and Ron dropped to the floor'

## Chapter 1

Her other foot found his weakest spot, and Ron dropped to the floor. He knew that she was very weak

from what he'd just done so far – but his heart wasn't in it for her or anything else… It would have

been better if they had a little more peace of mind, Harry thought as Hermione pulled away slowly

with an anxious smile on her face."Hermione?""I'm sorry, I'll get you some tea," She said

soothingly. "Maybe we can talk about something before tomorrow night's Quidditch match."Harry stared

at Pansy who took him by surprise and looked down at himself anxiously watching her carefully

looking up at them both. His eyes were still closed when Narcissa came running into their room. They

hurried over first thing together, as usual.""What are these people doing here?", Lucius asked

curiously eyeing all three of them closely then turned to Harry. A moment later, Narcissus appeared

behind the door leading into Gryffindor tower."We're going to go shopping", Hermione stated

kindly. She didn’t say why she wanted to come back home today, but Draco could see that there must

be something wrong now regarding her parents' relationship between herself (which was clearly not

working out well) - like Narcis has always known. Even though Harry did trust her enough

already...Malfoy gave him a questioning look after giving her answers which made Draco grin

slightly."Of course not! We need to visit Malfoy Manor first. And I think we should talk about the

wedding and get ready for it.""Then, why didn't you come?""Because Harry was worried that he might

be blackmailed or worse if someone tried something stupid on us," Pansy replied."Yes, but then

again, this year wasn’t like last time...""It is supposed now? Why don's all of us have a different

plan in mind before heading home today?" Harry asked as she continued talking with him while his

eyes were on her."You know how much my father hates me because of what happened at the Quidditch

World Cup yesterday," Hermione said with frustration. "And yet here I am sitting right next door to

Remus Lupin who could very well kill Dumbledore without even knowing anything else!"Harry groaned

loudly when he realized just where they were going back into the Gryffindor common room."I thought

maybe there would wait until after dinner so Potter wouldnÕre upset enough against Draco to let them

both sleep though," Luna sighed. She looked over at Ron and smiled at him briefly before walking out

of the Great Hall with a pop which made everyone stop in their tracks."Well, dear, did Lucius tell

Snape things either?"Pansi nodded and took another drink from her Butterbeer instead looking around

the other room. It was early morning by the looks of it too since no one had been able say more than

an hour ago anyway. “We’re going to have a baby,” he said as Hermione began talking with another

man. The woman was obviously feeling quite apprehensive about what she would be doing after the

babies were born and they all looked at her in surprise. Ron smiled at them both before giving Harry

his best smile. They sat down on either side of each other and made their way over towards where

Ginny lay. She was still looking nervous but seemed happy for him. He took a sip from his glass and

thought it might help. His mind wandered back to the night that he saw Sirius Black having a meeting

with his godfather who was actually trying out for the Auror position (which meant Dumbledore could

see how much power James Potter had) which also allowed Professor Snape's son-in law Fudge one less

reason not being involved due to his father getting rid himself away like a fugitive under the

Imperius Curse. When everything calmed down enough, Ron stood up quickly and walked around the

circle of people lining the streets leading off Hogwarts. As soon however when everyone stopped

moving suddenly Fred jumped into the middle of the crowd only to find George Weasley sitting beside

him across from him waiting for them to join them. Standing right next Draco gave his twin brother a

look that just wasn't there since neither of them wanted to talk openly while discussing anything

else. Suddenly Bill came rushing through together holding hands grabbing Molly by her hair standing

directly behind Fleur who was on the other side of the table. “Draco, I’m not sure if this is a good

idea or not, but it looks like we have to be careful about what we say next. You might get yourself

killed and Ginny won't forgive you for that either”. Harry looked up at Draco then pointed his wand

towards Fleurs as he left with an irritated look in his eyes.  The two didnÕt really know how they

ended their discussion just yet before Hermione entered the kitchen she heard Ron ask after taking

out some ice cream from his mug sitting right beside Hermione. She opened the door smiling slightly

once again knowing full well there wasn¬t going to ever go back to that conversation between them

any time soon. It took several seconds for the two ladies each talking down questions together

getting everyone ready to leave so quickly followed by Hermione having to wait until later than

usual when Floo powder arrived running through a large glass filled cupboard making it impossible

even within the hall to see anyone else entering duelling around most of their tables causing chaos

amongst all of them. They werenŭt exactly known gossiping among others however since everything had

been coming off fairly poorly during the last few weeks trying hard make sense of things rather

easily while still keeping themselves updated regarding information being spread throughout the

entire wizarding world telling people why Voldemort was attacking Hogwarts now despite no one

actually asking him more because Dumbledore refused such

## Chapter 2

Her other foot found his weakest spot, and Ron dropped to the floor. He could feel her breathing on

him as she crawled over me again."I'm sorry," I murmured in a low voice that made my heart beat

faster than usual for an instant before it stopped because of how fast we were moving against each

others' backs from where they'd been standing at all while leaning back so heavily their hips would

be pressed together even more; our bodies touching every single nerve within us;"We're...you

know..."She gasped hard when one of her hands ran down between mine causing both of them immediately

to dig into themselves trying not to cry out loud with embarrassment or shock anymore but still

sobbing deeply it was like hearing someone crying right now making you go crazy inside.""You just

couldn't see what happened outside?""Yeah!" She giggled louder then ever since having kissed Harry's

cheek under Diadem - "Now tell your mate about this sweet little witch who is already using those

horrible potions he gave Tom after being put through war once by Voldemort himself! What did

Dumbledore do? Is there something wrong?!"He raised up slightly surprised though only barely able to

hold off another whimper which caused Fred and George to snort loudly laughing hysterically

too-"They don’t have any idea why these two are doing such awful things without telling anyone

else.... Oh Merlin…""How dare Nymphadora Lovegood insinuate herself here?! Her name is Pansy

Parkinson- Oh God! Harry Potter, you are a fucking madman! I will not allow you to be an accessory

to a crime. You are my very personal enemy. So...I'm sorry dear. Please don't blame me for your lack

of judgment. If I had known sooner, I would have done it myself. But today, tonight? Tonight doesn’t

make the difference between us anymore than yesterday did. It does with everything else we do

together that matters in this world." He paused and looked down at his hands. "You must understand,"

he finally said as if he could take a breath before answering him again once more: “It wasnÕt all my

fault. This whole thing was just...irrational.""Maybe so," she agreed. She turned her eyes to look

at Sirius who seemed hesitant in his denial but still nodded. There were other things going on

behind their closed doors that needed getting out there. How many Death Eaters had he killed during

their last mission? How long had they been hiding from him until now?"We didn Ðve much time either,"

Sirius murmured, staring daggers at Harry's face."Harry!" Peeves came bursting into view right after

Harry had come up behind her."What happened next?", Harry asked as he sat back down across from

her.Hermione quickly pulled away from them, pulling Hermione closer to him as well and taking her

hand lightly in hers. The kiss had taken forever, as he'd never before felt like this. But she could

tell he wanted to hold on for a while longer; if that was what it took... Well maybe they could just

make love again someday. "I don't know," Harry said softly after a moment of silence between

them."Oh?""It's not too late for me to come back around here.""Alright then! I think you should get

ready first so we can talk later!""Thanks for your time," Hermione replied. She reached up and

brushed his hair away with the tip at one point when Draco was looking at him expectantly now (she

didn’t feel sorry for his reaction). It made everything better, although she knew that sometimes it

was good practice anyway- especially knowing that their relationship would be more than brief enough

without serious consequences.Harry blinked out several times until finally catching himself staring

at Pansy. He looked down at Luna with an expressionless face but couldnÕt help thinking about how

much he loved her."What did you do for Luna today? Are there any plans for our honeymoon yet?", Ron

asked, pulling herself together from behind her father."I mean, obviously it will take place some

time since we are still working through Arithmancy, but-"Pansys mouth fell open slowly and her eyes

widened. Harry quickly got rid both boys off their feet and turned toward his friend once again - in

which he was shocked to see Draco standing up with two hooded heads and a black cloak. Draco could

only stare at the man for a moment before turning back around to face him."And you're doing this all

on your own?""I am," he said as he raised his eyebrows into confusion, "and I'm not even going out

of my way tonight.""What? That's ridiculous!" Hermione exclaimed indignantly. She didn't know what

he had just done, but she knew it was more than likely because of the look upon her face. They were

clearly in love! What sort of relationship would they have if there weren’t any competition between

them?!Draco rolled his eyes; apparently, he wasnÕt completely sure how much worse that scenario

really sounded. He wondered why anyone would ever do anything like Malfoy. In fact... perhaps they

were too good-looking or something else entirely. It seemed unlikely that they wouldn' be able stand

each other anymore after years together without the threat facing their faces from one another many

times over.The next morning Granger left to find her parents. The last thing she wanted right now

though – while still very young --was some kind duress between Ron Weasley who never saw eye contact

with anyone, nor Harry Potter whose heart ached under whatever dementors might try attacking Pansy

Parkinson again. Well guess what…Hermione was glad that she found Ginny in her room rather quickly

after

## Chapter 3

Her other foot found his weakest spot, and Ron dropped to the floor. "Stop," he demanded. Harry

stepped in front of him and wiped the sweat from her face before he grabbed her by both arms

again."I'm sorry," she said as tears welled up in between their eyes; it was painful enough when

they were cold at night but something had gone wrong with them. She'd been lying in bed for a long

time now without sleep because someone had attacked her. It wasn't just a woman, or anyone else,

that could have done this—it must be all around Draco Malfoy! Harry's heart clenched, feeling so

small and so hard inside his chest. He tried not even think about how badly Hermione would hurt if

there weren’t a single man left alive who knew what happened next…and yet here he sat, alone after

having the last man take care of everything for him...and it felt like forever. ~~~~~ “Ron? What‘re

you doing down here?! I don-i need help right now…or do me better than you! You know why I get into

this fucking mess!?”  Her voice came out brokenly, which didnÕt bother Ron. That same fury coursed

through him as soon Ginny let go back into the room where his father remained standing, clutching

frantically to one shoulder. A sob tore free then slowly followed, a strained cry breaking its way

over Harry Sr.'s broken lip. "But you don't want me to fuck her, do ya? Don’t worry about it." She

snickered as Harry smiled and grabbed his wand from the table. He didnÕt need a wand for this; he

already knew how Ron was feeling. HermioneÒI will not waste time. I won Ð but if that means anything

more than sex then yes so be it!Ó ÔYou are my wife now Ginny Weasley is my husband, I am yours too I

promise You that. Do your best to respect that decision- no one else in our house would have allowed

you an extra hand in this.ØBut what shall we say to each other after the game? This is all just like

last year with Harry and maybe next weekend.? Yes please.. they could keep going... We can go on

without him though. But at least she knows who Paul or Luna is anyway, doesn ve she? Got any idea

of where their souls are???Hermione, love… Where did you find out everything before Hogwarts had

started? Did you see McGonagall give you something to think about when she told you two were back

home alone until dinner left them, because Fred seemed to be coming up behind us...? Well actually

there was nothing quite like that anymore except still being ableto talk while everyone laughed

around Quidditch practices (even against Draco). And even Dumbledore kept trying new things. His

first was to go after Albus Dumbledore, the man who had been so despised and feared since he'd

returned from Hogwarts that year. He got him into a fight with Snape's godfather in his second term

– probably at the same time as Ron had gone off to France for his seventh birthday party in October.

For some reason Voldemort wanted to make sure it was just Harry and Ron being friends again, because

they were now dead. The Death Eaters on the loose liked their chance too; if not outright killed

them then Hermione could still be saved by Harry – she was able enough of course… but there was no

way anyone would ever know how close one of those people really came to death without knowing what

happened afterwards! As much fun as it would have felt to watch Weasley and Luna die, all three of

them needed to keep an eye out for Death Eater activity and try something different once the war

ended. "I thought you two might want this week off," Sirius said to Ginny when they passed her a cup

of tea. She nodded, looking over at Sirius' mother."Oh!" She turned to look at Dumbledore where they

stood.Ginny snorted, “That was great. It means more than I think we can possibly do.""Well, thank

yeh for it," Dumbledore smiled back kindly towards Gideon while Dumbledore eyed Neville anxiously.As

soon apparated away McGonagall moved forward next door to Hagrid’s old house and held out a small

round mirror, which was situated on the table. “Let‘M-my dear, let me see if I can get her one of

these.” Hermione laughed at him as he handed it over just in time for his eyes started glowing red

with mischief… ‒Well…I know that she is beautiful but you may have heard about her being attracted

by other girls. How many times has your precious Harry Potter been teased about this?– He frowned

slightly before looking up at Dumbledore who gave them both an odd look. As soon they saw their

teacher standing there alone all seemed lost in thought. After several minutes of silence, Hagulus

finally spoke. The teacher glanced around them as though he were trying not only recognize them from

somewhere else – he had noticed something odd coming from the room behind them… That, however did

nothing whatsoever to help Dumbledore‧ feelings towards Scorpius Malfoy (or anyone) during those

five years back when the boy was still very much alive! It was probably because he felt like a

teenage girl now, despite having been called into Azkaban previously upon returning to school and

leaving Hogwarts due more than once to someone calling him that. And yet again he found himself

wondering why Snape hadn't ever told him anything while Sirius Black had obviously tried

unsuccessfully so far in trying somehow locate Harry. For some strange reason, Severus Snape decided

against telling anybody exactly what
