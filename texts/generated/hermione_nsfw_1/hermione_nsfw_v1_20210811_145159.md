'“Dumbledore? Did he do anything?” He asked as he walked in front of'

## Chapter 1

“Dumbledore? Did he do anything?” He asked as he walked in front of her.Hermione turned around,

looking at him with a puzzled look on his face when she felt his hands against hers and the tension

building up inside them, ‘What did Dumbledore do to you? Where was I? What happened? Why didn't you

say something now? Oh my god! This is getting so out-of-" Her breath caught."No…no…I don...he's...a

Death Eater," She said, struggling for breath but not caring that she sounded weak. "But

why?""Because Voldemort can use me again or because it will kill someone else if necessary…"

Hermione thought about it for a moment before taking a deep calming draught from an empty cupboard

and pulling herself back towards where there were tears streaming down her cheeks.She stepped

forward slowly with one hand, allowing Harry just enough space to stand by her side without any

trouble. ’Why havenÕt you told us everything yet? All this time?' She wondered how long it would

take to tell everyone what had happened, even though they hadn Ðfinally started finding out after

all these years. She should be able explain things quickly.'ItÓs fine, love,' She whispered

quietly.Harry laughed softly. 'Well then, letÒus talk to Ginny first.''And Ron too,' Hermione said.

 So far, no word has come from either Malfoy or his father since. Perhaps it will be easier to find

a way in for the moment?The rest of their group continued on with Harry and Draco as they watched

Dumbledore walk towards them. It was early evening so everyone had plenty more time before curfew

would begin."I think we should go," Sirius said with an uncomfortable sigh. "Let's start by getting

ready.""Okay, let's do that then," Snape said as he took several steps forward and began placing a

couple dozen charms upon them all while looking over Remus' shoulder at Hermione who was standing

there. She nodded her head slightly but did not look pleased about the task she now faced.Professor

McGonagall sighed heavily and gave one last farewell once again before heading back into Gryffindor

tower."Alright girls?""Yes sir," Ron muttered quietly after observing Potter and Weasley exit

through the portrait hole just behind him.Hermione turned around to face Skyla. He thought this

would be her answer to everything, but something told him otherwise.Skylark didn't turn away when

someone approached her from outside.It seemed like many people were already inside Hogwarts and only

two students remained: Sirius Black (who was still wearing his robes) along side Bleeding Eyes

Greyback; Lily Evans - although she wasn’t allowed anywhere near the Headmaster at least, and Alice

Longbottom - who looked much less intimidating than the others- but if anyone wanted anything from

an enemy, it was you. You're the best," he said and then sat down next to her."What are you going on

about?""Nothing important.""But I've been wanting this for a while now," she replied as she leaned

in to kiss him again before resting her forehead against his neck once more with one hand still

pressed firmly against hers there; his other pressing into nothing at all."You know that's not what

we talked about last time...I'm just trying so hard to tell myself no matter how badly my mind is

working or even when someone else gets hurt during the battle..."Draco chuckled slightly causing

Hermione stomach rumbling "so can't help it really? So will your son!""Right! That's why Mum told me

yesterday after hearing us talk over Ron talking amongst yourselves two days ago today night-"

Hermione stopped herself by leaning back looking at him;"And don’t be ridiculous here okay?! It was

none of your business though…It wasnÕs Draco who killed Riddle…" Hermione sighed again feeling like

a little girl. She had seen too many times Malfoy made such comments regarding people they didn¬t

care much and yet somehow kept them out of their minds anymore.Hermione thought briefly thinking

something could have happened between them both.. But instead she started to feel very confused.

What exactly did Draco say? He knew everything: When would Potter try throwing himself off Voldemort

because of Harry having escaped? He really couldn’t help it, but he was so lost in his thoughts that

he thought maybe there had been some sorta curse or something. It would be better if the baby wasn't

around him now. His eyes were closed and he didnÕt want to see her again. This time she wouldn¬t

touch anything. And even though it might be a bit painful for Harry not knowing why, at least he

knew how much he wanted this moment with Hermione...it was still just too good to pass up.   He

should have stayed here during their break-up when they were together! But instead…It was as if

someone else was right behind him, and all he could think about was what he needed from her as

well....and then suddenly he felt like he oughtnÐt say those things anymore, not ever. That was

going away. Maybe Ginny hadn Øve talked to him enough about what happened before…Maybe Neville is

dead?! What kind!? Not yet anyway...Harry walked over next door thinking more about everything,

trying hard NOT TO TELL HER THAT SHE DIDNÓT NEED HIM AND THAT HE WOULD MAKE THIS A FAULT WITHOUT

ANYTHING BUT LOVE FROM YOU!!! Ron tried telling Harry that sex was important, he really did need

him! So many times throughout the day after Christmas he'd asked Godric where Luna LovegoodÒs room

belonged. Sometimes

## Chapter 2

“Dumbledore? Did he do anything?” He asked as he walked in front of her. ‘Oh, yes!’ Hermione gasped

and shook her head vigorously at his statement on the matter with such a fondness that she nearly

fell off him before they reached their bedroom together without another word exchanged between them

when someone stepped into Harry's room to announce Dumbledore had come back. He smiled weakly at it

all for a moment and then nodded to himself with an annoyed sigh. That was how he came to be at

Ginny Weasley Burrow. Her eyes widened slightly from what she heard and glanced up towards Ron who

seemed quite pleased by this news coming from her friend since she wasn't sure if it would affect

his actions or not but felt rather bad about it nonetheless because there were still so many

questions looming over her mind where she could go next. She tried hard enough getting rid away from

whatever thoughts he might have regarding her situation, until she found herself sitting down beside

Ron and watching him silently stare at something that was clearly out loud and yet completely

unconcerned. "Ron?" He said hesitantly while walking across town looking around the store slowly. A

tear slipped past his eye which caused her heart rate increase exponentially faster than normal even

though she hadnÕt really been expecting it to happen right now. It was almost like she was going

insane again after having spent some time with him; she didn Ð not think she should say much more

unless I told her everything. She was a virgin, so it was possible that maybe my mother had gotten

the message and given me some information on how to get closer with her."Oh," Luna said softly but

slightly, "no.""But you know what?" Harry asked as he looked down at his hands.She nodded slowly

before kissing them again. He pulled back quickly from her lips in an effort not interrupting their

kiss. Her eyes watered for several seconds until she finally cleared her throat once again trying

desperately hard inside of him without even thinking about it anymore or doing anything else."I've

never really thought too far into things yet," Ron mumbled under his breath after taking another

deep breath. "What is there left to be done? Just like last time when we were together. How long

will this have been?""About twenty minutes now," Pansy replied quietly."Well..." Harry began to

ponder over the situation. They'd met during their first year; having sex while they both were away

studying by themselves - something that would cause Draco's body heat just to plummet lower than

usual due entirely upon seeing Hermione Granger naked out in front of everyone watching them. That

was definitely something he needed right now, especially since he knew very little about the two

witches other then Xenophilius Malfoy who he could trust most when all those years ago telling him

exactly why he loved Luna Lovegood and how he felt towards him.The idea made sense, but knowing

nothing about it really hurt her so much, she didn’t know how to react or what would happen if she

did something stupid like that. It was scary and embarrassing. The guilt and the anger were all too

present in there. She felt as if someone had kissed her lips."You can't just leave me alone,"

Hermione said quietly when he turned around, standing up from his desk. "I'll have a big talk with

you later tonight.""Good idea," Theo agreed.Hermione shook her head at her friends before turning

back to the small group of girls waiting outside their door while they waited for Daphne

Greengrass's arrival back at Hogwarts School on Saturday night...With Draco out now, Hermione could

feel her heart stuttering slightly more than usual. In fact..."Draco?" he called softly after

Hermione opened her mouth enough not falling asleep again.He raised an eyebrow questioningly towards

her."Can I come? Do we need anything else?""No, this is my room. We don need any other furniture

besides my books.""Wait! You mean like...my dresser, your dressing gown -all right? And some things

Harry needs here already!""Yes, thank Merlin I've got everything ready-""Now then, are you sure no

one will be coming into our dorms today anyway?" Hermione asked, taking a deep breath before asking

the next question; why exactly wouldnÕ tat was going on with him? The only other time he had seen

his fatherÝs face when they were in school, he thought bitterly. Draco was a boy, the type to just

let things slide and think about what they wanted without actually thinking it through first thing

into their minds – but now that he saw her face there hurt even more as he walked past her. He

didn't like the way she looked at him, it made him want nothing less than for her all over again! He

never liked people being nice to him. It had always bothered him before now… But this girl really

needed to be left alone. Now he found himself feeling guilty for not telling her sooner. If she

didn’t know how much he wanted someone else around him then perhaps she would have started to tease

him too much or maybe she wouldn¬t understand. “I don- I mean, thank you for asking,‒ Draco said

softly from his seat beside Hermione who sat next them both near an empty table opposite Narcissa

Malfoy of course. He had no idea if she knew where he stood by looking at her sadly, as she still

seemed oblivious to his question despite herself until the moment she stepped closer towards him so

close that Ron could feel his own unease radiating off her pale skin. She had known since Hogwarts.

Just because his mother never called him that didn Ômean she couldnâve figured it out better than he

did

## Chapter 3

“Dumbledore? Did he do anything?” He asked as he walked in front of her. Hermione shook her head,

“No… not really.’ She didn't say it aloud, but she knew him well enough to know that he had

something to tell her about his life and death situation for the time being anyways because

Dumbledore hadnÕt been present when he came to find out what had happened. They were just alone

together now… And Voldemort was gone with no one else. There wasn- It was too late then! Harry tried

again thinking back on how heÓd ended up in that cellar after all. It had taken years before they

realized where Dumbledore would be hiding and who he truly belonged: Ron Weasley himself. Ginny

remembered seeing him there a few months ago at Grimmauld Place. ÒHe told me you were missing from

your dormitory.Ð Harry said quickly still shocked by this news – did he mean if you left home behind

or is he referring only strictly To my appearance outside Hogwarts at night. I guess whatever the

hell he meant By 'unbeknownst', eh?Ô ØMy sight was never blurred through by darkness,õ she thought

bitterly remembering her encounter with Neville during their final year at school weeks before

Christmas. What kind Of evil man does he have!? Who could have possibly heard them call each other

names like that?? If nothing else than to get revenge against those annoying little bastards. As for

you, I don't care what you think. Don’t be a twat and go after the boy who gave me this bloody

gift!” Harry yelled back as he tore at the offending shirt that had been left hanging around his

neck by Lucius Malfoy's arms. “What do we have here?‘P-please let him finish up with his mouth on my

arse before I tell Potter to leave!'Lucius chuckled bitterly and looked down sadly.'Oh,' Draco said

warmly from where they were standing in front of the fire place - just outside Hagrid‒s hut. He was

leaning over one tree when Harry turned suddenly to look towards them.'Dumbledore?'Harry frowned

briefly but nodded quickly enough to reach out and touch himself. The headmaster smiled brightly

while drawing circles beneath his chin and ear.'Are you sure about it, Mr Malfoy... are your robes

okay?''Not quite yet,' Harry admitted. 'I reckon Hogwarts doesnÕt seem all that bad anyway.''And if

not then maybe everything should work itself out better now-'They stopped mid sentence; both men

started laughing again until Hermione leaned closer, nuzzling into Draco like she always did. She

tugged softly onto Harryìs arm and kissed him passionately, slowly pulling away slightly so her

tongue would trail across his jawline and cheekbone.Draco groaned inwardly though and pulled soft

kisses along Harry�s jaw. He was going to need that soon, so he broke the kiss into a small snog

with Harry’ll. It was an innocent little gesture on his part, but it seemed very much like an act of

affection for Harry. ~~ ♥ A/N: I don't know how long this story will be without another big update!

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments in writing please leave them below!!! :)

Thanks again everyone!! This has been such a pleasure reading up on my work at school over Christmas

break now (I think). Not only did Dumbledore tell us about our Patronus curse being cast as a Death

Eater attack against Krum during Hogwarts, we also learned many new facts from him regarding

Riddle's death- no one else had known just what sort of attacks would happen when they turned their

attention to Voldemort by attacking Granger... thank you all SO MUCH!!!! ;) Oh yes there are more

NEWT books coming out next week which should hopefully help keep students occupied throughout

holidays season… sorry guys~ “How do I get your password?” Hermione asked curiously looking around

Draco Malfoy‘s office while holding her wand pointed at him. ‒You can always come here first thing

tomorrow morning after class is finished; see ya later Saturday afternoon then meet back home today

evening through 5pm till lunchtime* –Where does that come from?? Ron muttered under his breath

trying not to hear the laughter that escaped him. Hermione stepped back quickly and looked down at

Harry, who was staring at her curiously. “I see you’re going out with Ginny, but...if we can get a

hold of him for a few hours then you know what I mean? He‘ll be fine.” ‒But he―s so angry!– Harry

shouted, his voice cracking slightly as if it had been caught by Wirey in an accident or something

close enough; it sounded like they were yelling about one another and he was sure the man probably

hadn't noticed any difference. Ron tried again - this time he didnÐt want them hearing anything else

except for himself. It was still early afternoon when she walked into Fred Weasley's room and asked

him where he went. Fred shook his head, looking rather annoyed despite himself before he continued

on. When George came home suddenly, all he could think about was how shocked everyone must have

seemed at seeing their friend so upset. Then there wasn- what did he do!?   In fact both twins knew

exactly why such things happened, even though neither of them wanted anyone knowing yet. Even after

everything which had happened between them, Draco still felt anger bubbling inside him now because

of the sudden outburst.  He clenched his jaw hard against rage but refused help coming up with the

words. "No," Fred mumbled over his shoulder,
