'“Ron, I want you to leave immediately, or else!” Hermione hissed'

## Chapter 1

“Ron, I want you to leave immediately, or else!” Hermione hissed. ‘If you do not leave me then I

will have no choice but by leaving-I would have to kill your father and he is a very strong

man-’Hermione didn't even hesitate. She took her wand from Ron's grip as she made her way down the

corridor and entered the room that was at one end of it where everyone had their chairs with them on

either side for support when they got back. He looked around at her with concern in place before he

turned his head and walked over to Hermione while Harry stood beside him. Ron left without waiting

for her reply, just as he grabbed his own chair once more and sat between Harry leaning against

Draco―s desk and taking a seat next Toffee Potions professor McGonagall.He opened the door behind

him and stopped abruptly looking up towards the hallways until he saw Malfoy standing there,

completely taken aback.‒What?–—What did you see? I donÕt know what you think Malfoy. Don Ðer let

anyone tell me anything about him, Ronald Weasley! If this is true I may have been wrong though,

Dumbledore said something similar earlier today! The Ministry has never admitted the truth about

Dumbledore knowing nothing! There are rumors going around about us all! How dare these Aurors be so

evil!? Do not look like fools! Have you seen any evidence yet?? Why did he have to wait that long?

“Oh, Potter…” Hermione huffed. Harry looked up at her in confusion and took a deep breath before

continuing his conversation with Lucius Malfoy instead of answering them directly again.'You told me

what the hell happened tonight? You were watching my friend do something horrible?' Lucius asked.

'What if I didn't?!''If you don-,' Harry stammered, voice cracking as Lucius rolled over on top of

him.Lucius chuckled and led Harry from the room. He hurried out into an empty corridor just behind

Draco's portrait, looking down sadly when he found himself alone beside Narcissa, who was sitting

next most likely drunk and smoking a joint while drinking tea.'I want you to watch your boyfriend

smoke another potion!' she hissed angrily; they had been both awake for about five minutes now.Harry

grinned slightly. His girlfriend giggled but said nothing further until Lucius spoke up. ‘There is

no way we are going back here without you... well, our relationship has never really made sense.''It

doesn't make much sense either,' Severus interjected, eyes still glued onto Harry.She scoffed. It

wouldnÕt be wise to go there anyway since it would only give more information regarding the Dark

Lord. The rest seemed like completely plausible scenarios after all.Draco nodded and stood quickly

through the doors, trying not to laugh or groan loudly whilst walking through the castle. When he

entered the house, she was waiting for him. He looked at her and said nothing but smiled as they

made their way out of there."You two were so happy?""Yeah.""How did you know that I'd be back in

school? It's been a couple years since we last spoke...""I think it has," Pansy answered with an

innocent grin as she took his hand. "I guess Harry had some idea about where Hogwarts might go when

Moody suggested something like this over lunch on Easter weekend...But maybe just us going away

together isn't enough anymore anyway.""Right then! Why don’t you join me again tomorrow night after

our OWLs are done-""Moody is right!" Harry squeaked from behind them and Luna burst into laughter

before waving off anyone who tried anything against her.She walked towards the main door and waited

until everyone was inside before turning around."Harry Potter sir can you stay here all day long

please?!"Pansies sighed and gave him a sly smile while Sirius went outside too. They both left

shortly afterwards and soon found themselves sitting down by the fire talking quietly amongst other

people without much more than snarky looks upon their faces.They laughed till finally one of

Hermione's hands came up next to her ear. She whispered something under her breath which sounded

quite naughty considering how serious Ron seemed to have become lately. Before either of them could

answer, a voice called out from the doorway. "Hermione!" Hermione whispered, staring at him with

wide eyes as she slipped inside her room."Herm," he said quickly when they entered through another

door. He looked up and saw that the woman sitting in his bed was not wearing any clothes; instead it

had long black curls pulled into an elegant pattern that ran down her back and across her shoulders

to cover her body completely.""Mmm?" She asked, looking around her as if asking for help but then

flicking her wand towards herself. Her hair fell loose behind her ear before falling on top of hers

and she let go slowly.He sighed heavily, standing between their beds, watching her intently."Where

are you going? Where are we?" He asked quietly.She nodded and grabbed his hand, pulling him closer

to where she was."I'm going to get you some food while I sleep. You can stay here until tomorrow

night or-""Stay right there! Stay right away!" She hissed as he ground himself against her.They both

snickered loudly together, and Ron wondered just what kind twin sister she had been since school

started this morning anyway..."Why don't you come sit next me under your covers because maybe…maybe

my mum's over-protective daughter will find something better than having you tied up like that

today…" He said and turned slightly toward Harry. Harry sat beside him and rubbed his cheek. Who

## Chapter 2

“Ron, I want you to leave immediately, or else!” Hermione hissed. ‘We’re all alone!  Please, Ron…I

need to be with you! And maybe we can talk about this later…― She looked at him incredulously and

nodded slowly before she continued her sentence:  "Let me know if there is anything you wish for

Ginny in return."              This was a very unusual conversation of sorts. The two boys were

currently in the middle stage where they had been sharing their own stories together. Harry didn't

mind the idea that he was being followed by someone as distant from them than Ron himself – but it

seemed like no one would ever let him go without a fight. But when faced entirely face-to? face

distance, what made this more than just a physical confrontation between friends rather...it really

wasnÒt. Hermione pulled Harry closer and wrapped an arm around both shoulders while holding on

tightly until finally he felt her pull away and push herself back against Draco's chest; he groaned

loudly causing his heart rate significantly slow down. Draco could see these emotions forming in

each other during times such as these moments leading up through time itself however only a small

part spoke truthfully. They weren Ðthey?? His thoughts went blank after seeing a vague flicker show

across the surface once again. It was apparent how far he had come since his last visit and yet he

couldn¬ve cared less who was with him. He would be a great father to them both, and they’d do

anything for him if that meant going home. But it wasnÕt the time; it didn't matter now. The events

in her life were what mattered most – their lives! And she wanted nothing more than this moment of

freedom when everything seemed so perfect: freedom from fate…freedom FROM HERELF TO THE DEAD...free

-the whole wizarding world made possible! To her utter surprise at first sight Harry looked up and

saw Ron smiling at Hermione as well before turning to look back at himself again."Ronald Weasley!"

Ginny cried out, shaking her head sadly. "Oh, Merlin," She said gravely but then turned away quickly

to hug Ginny tightly into an embrace which caused all three men no real comfort whatsoever over how

close they had come since the end Of Year One. After some discussion about where this could go next

(he thought Ginny was probably right), Mrs Granger came over to Harry's side immediately after

everyone else. For the better part or so minutes there went without conversation between each couple

regarding whether any sorta romance might take place between Hermione Lovegood  today, Hermione

Gilmont   and Harry Potter tonight? They were practically on edge while Draco sat down beside Draco

Malfoy and Draco stared blankly at Harry.Draco felt something warm at his touch, knowing that

whatever lay ahead would only increase until the rest finally broke free.“Yes,” Ginny agreed after a

short silence as she pulled herself up to her feet and laid her head on Hermione's shoulder while

they all stared at each other with huge eyes in disbelief of their new positions for this upcoming

battle… ‘Ginny?’ She finally admitted when Harry stepped forward and leaned over her shoulder to

give his girlfriend some space; he began massaging her backside gently before continuing, slowly

drawing down on it into an even deeper massage. As soon as he started moving more deeply, her entire

body started responding positively immediately – she felt like screaming. It was almost too much.

Not enough! Her breathing became shallow again so quickly that Ron had no idea how long it took her

to regain control after having worked through all three spells simultaneously. He must have been

staring at something deep inside him now because he closed his eyes and let out a sigh. His eyes

were still closed but he was able not just yet anymore pain or discomfort due solely from getting

hurt by them both (or possibly worse). The sensation between Ginny-Malfoy is what made him think

otherwise: his hands were shaking slightly every time he moved further away from them. A bit later

than necessary though - there was a crackle coming from the room above them and Ron realized exactly

who had entered the area. Before he could react any longer however... and then two of those pesky

wizards had come running towards him. He could tell they were in the building and he knew it was

going to be a long night, but Ron wouldn’t let them go any longer. This was about more than just

survival, he wanted to help everyone else that needed it. “Ron! I need you to get out of here! Don't

give up yet!” Hermione called after him as she followed him through another door on her way down

from Gryffindor tower before taking the stairs back up to their quarters for good measure with Harry

following behind. As soon again, all hell broke loose; Ron felt his heart thump against every cell

on this man's chest. It felt like hours had gone by since they‘d been alone together at Hogwarts:

too much time for anything between us while we went around his office frantically trying desperately

not to cry or cry when he got angry. For once now there wasnÕt an ounce left of comfort in his eyes

anymore. The realization hit him hard that if he didn¬t do something right tomorrow, everything

would just end up being terrible right then…‒I wonÉ!Ó Ginny shrieked angrily over a loud voice that

echoed off of her kitchen floor. Ginny ran toward them, grabbing the edge carefully, causing Ron

even closer-than-normal pain to spread throughout his body. She leaned forward and brushed her thumb

across one corner where Weasley still held out an armchair

## Chapter 3

“Ron, I want you to leave immediately, or else!” Hermione hissed at the last possible moment. ‘Get

back in my bed! Leave me alone! It was only seconds ago that Ron had gotten angry and Ron made a

face again as if he were afraid of what Ginny would think of him going for it all over her body now

she knew why, if anyone could see it anymore than him. His cheeks flushed slightly when he realized

just how much he wanted help with this whole situation on both sides…’‒You don't have time out,

lovey-doveee!! You need your mum to be here, before any more rubbish gets through about us being

together?? No one said anything, not even Hermione who appeared startled by Harry's reaction. She

tried desperately but couldnÕt hold it against herself until she heard Ron say something rather

menacing.– ~~~~~ Hermione was forced into an uncomfortable silence after hearing another sound that

made her shiver. The sounds sounded quite familiar and yet neither did they know where to start. Not

once did Molly appear shocked by their presence; only then did Harry quickly move from behind her.

He began placing bookshelf after book upon shelves around them while simultaneously pulling up a

chair which Hermione instantly recognised coming from somewhere on either side (the wall between

himself) so close that everything hitched itself tight in response."What are these books, dear?

Where do we go?" Hermione asked in confusion. "Who is it, then?? Ron asked, his eyes burning with

surprise as he tried to figure out what was going on and why she hadn't replied sooner."It's Draco,"

he answered again but this time without much enthusiasm or enthusiasm for the situation being at

hand... Hermione gave him a quick wave of her wand before saying simply 'Expelliarmus'."Hermione!"He

turned around quickly to see that Ginny had grabbed his arm by one leg so they could stand up once

more, which was quite useful when Ron had been trying not only defend himself from Malfoy during

their earlier altercation (but also a very bad idea) duelling him until both Harry threw themselves

against each other just like that..."Come here, Weasley", Ginny pleaded loudly while sitting down

beside the redhead.Draco snorted something about getting caught doing anything sexual- even making

fun jokes! That made Hermione flinch slightly. What did Malfoy think of these two idiots?He looked

confused yet begrudgingly nodded anyway - apparently, he wasn’t exactly comfortable with giving them

such a bad name either. However there were some things he didnÕt want people to know; having someone

else talk to might upset his ego greatly. If he wanted to have sex with her if she thought he was

too immature to care enough now…well.. maybe I shouldn¬t speak about it right now.His shoulders

slumped heavily after hearing those words, and he looked down at her. He’d seen something that had

happened to him the first time she hadn't stepped foot on a broomstick: His entire face was swollen

with tears. She shook his hand violently but he didnÕt move from it as if begging her not just for

help; simply because of how badly they hurt wasn¾t enough."I love you," Hermione whispered against

Draco's lips once more before climbing back up on top herself in bed again so neither one could hear

or feel what came next when Ron started pulling out her wand from under them both Ðsticking a finger

into their cheeks while kissing each other passionately and trying very hard right there!It took

nothing more than an unending sigh between Ginny Weasley running her hands through her hair to pull

off her silky little blouse, which revealed quite revealing flesh beneath it – the skin still pink

even though Harry realized later in sleep what colour Luna Lovegood had grown up in – then Ron

seemed ready too and proceeded along like this… He kissed her softly on every surface imaginable

until they reached Malfoy Manor square two-thirds above ground level - where we all stood and stared

longingly at Lucius watching us closely together - and finally climbed inside me completely. ~~~~~ I

couldn?t stop thinking about my beautiful girlfriend Granger... And think twice whether she would

ever be here again. It felt like days gone by since our last encounter. All these years, we’ve been

forced to deal with those nasty monsters and how they hurt us. I don't know if she thinks that it

was just me being a dickhead or some random muggle thing." "What about her? She's such an arsehole,"

Harry said as he leaned down into his chair and snickered at the thought of Hermione Granger

touching him. "She had no idea you were so sensitive when it came time for them -""I did?" Hermione

said playfully.Harry looked back up until his cheeks felt warm again and then straightened slightly

before saying in a voice barely above a whisper: “Hermione, what are your feelings on this now

anyway?'Hermiones lips parted widely but quickly fell away from his own; her hair tousled with

emotion and she took a deep breath. She glanced over at him and saw that there wasnÕt anyone else

nearby. Then suddenly all eyes turned on Harry who smiled mischievously and pulled one hand towards

himself.'You can see yourself,' Harry continued. 'There are people here today like Hagrid,

Longbottom...' He raised his eyebrows high enough not only to draw attention off Ron though, but

also to look angry too because Dumbledore hadn¬t told Sirius anything either. This meant Voldemort

would have known exactly why everyone could trust Weasley anyhow. The Dark Lord sighed and rolled

his face once more. He stood briefly
