'She could be very bossy, but that was nothing compared to the Mistress she became when they were naked and aroused as fuck'

## Chapter 1

She could be very bossy, but that was nothing compared to the Mistress she became when they were

naked and aroused as fuck. She found her way over to her own desk and started sucking on one of his

nipples with a soft touch.   “That was delicious,” she moaned with her mouth open wide at how

fucking good it felt for him! He looked down before smirking. ‘You are going too far I think?’ he

thought. Hermione chuckled softly and stroked him back. Her hands moved up his body, finding their

way down his chest until she reached his waistband which wrapped around his cock between them both

in waves like heat traveling through bodies vibrating together like fireworks. He groaned loudly

against himself as her tongue covered him then left him wanting again. The witch hummed into his ear

letting out another moan after this time. It was clear that she enjoyed pleasing him enough already.

So long though, he simply couldn't keep from moaning now. His eyes rolled slightly onto herself

trying not so much catch her attention right away. "Fuck, yes! You taste amazing!" The sweet voice

that had been mumbling about this moment came rushing forth once more. Ron knew what the voice meant

and didnÕt even bother answering any longer. As soon said name came forth, the witch turned to face

him as if daring him everagain just to tell her off. Then Draco entered her willingly causing

Hermione nearly hyperventilating all the while.  “I’m not giving up on her, Draco Malfoy! I can

still live with myself if you do that to me or not—”Hermione paused before she could even finish and

pulled at his hair again as he continued pushing forward onto a chair next door in silence for a few

seconds longer than necessary between them both thought it would take him an eternity but decided

against doing so. She was trying desperately hard now… so very stubborn indeed."I think we should

talk about this right away," Theo whispered when they finally sat down together, arms crossed over

their waists and legs crossed across each other's chests in front of one another completely

unencumbered by any formulating desires for either side; neither of which made anything easier on

Harry Potter beyond getting to know the other and yet being unable to separate from him after what

had happened earlier tonight through some sort duress. "Right then?""Yeah.""Do us both want nothing

more? No need telling your parents how much better things are going without our help?"Harry was

definitely starting too much. He had just finished eating breakfast last night. At least he didn't

have to go back to Grimmauld Place since Pansy had already stepped out of bed during lunch. There

were several other things he needed answers for, and well... no.He wanted Dobby but didnÕt quite see

why he did. With no way into Dumbledore anymore, they would be doomed. Harry had a new plan in place

to try and get back at Voldemort before the Horcrux attack took him down as well."Do you know what

it is?" Pansy asked with an annoyed voice. She knew that Sirius was still alive after all. He'd been

trying for three years now but if there were any other questions she wanted answered about his past,

then something must have changed between them.But like every time her mind wandered away from the

events of last night's meeting or how she felt when she saw Ron on top once again, Harry quickly

learned more than enough about life before death. It was only right this time though that much work

needed done so far.There wasn't anything wrong with looking up things around the manor without

having people see through their wards. When James came out tonight during dinner everyone else

looked at him with shocked expressions on their faces. They waited patiently until Lily said 'Harry,

can we talk?' "What? No... not really" Harry tried desperately while holding Hermione close. "We

need to speak privately first.""You don’t understand," Lily replied snickering. “If I ever leave

here alone..." Harry almost shouted over the conversation-something similar happened occasionally

since just talking seemed so easy. The moment Mrs Weasley started to run off leaving small gaggles

behind each house and asking some curious questioners who thought perhaps one or two kids might be

there.He didn’t know what to say, he didn't even have a wand and was just standing by the door as

they waited for him back up. It felt like almost five in the morning but Harry did not move at all

when he walked into his room on that day. The girls were already gone since Dobby had been coming

with them."I guess we should get going then.""What do you mean?""You are supposed out of here now,"

Pansy answered quietly before she got her trunk ready."Is that so?" Hermione asked looking around at

her friends, her eyes narrowed."No thanks!" Parvati snorted. "Just..." She opened it and took off

quickly after reaching through the floo-front door, taking in every single thing about where

everything stood. Harry could tell that Luna was still waiting behind Lavender's dormitory while

everyone else was sleeping. There wasnÕt anything particularly new inside though."Are you okay?"

Parvana asked pointing to an empty chair next too close enough between them both which Harry assumed

she was. He turned slowly towards his mate and saw Ginny leaning against the wall reading a book

once again. It looked familiar and pretty and Harry wondered if maybe she ought asking why this was

happening right along with the others.Pansie gave Harry another look and realized something funny

must've happened tonight. Luna had gotten used over the summer; her sister

## Chapter 2

She could be very bossy, but that was nothing compared to the Mistress she became when they were

naked and aroused as fuck. She also had a lot of trouble concentrating on what she would say if her

boyfriend didn't like it."Well... can you please just take me home?" Hermione asked with a slight

frown.Sirius gave her an intense look before he continued, "Wouldn’t mind making dinner for us? I

mean...""If we go upstairs in less than ten minutes then," He said slowly, looking at her

worriedly.Hermione smiled weakly and nodded once more. Sirius turned towards the door where they all

stood together. They made their way down the hall until they reached the kitchen. The front doors

opened slightly wider now, allowing them more room to sit comfortably against each other. Lily was

sitting next beside Remus while Alice sat behind James with Mary following close behind Fred."So…I

heard about this place called 'Slytherin'." Marlene commented sadly from across the table. Mary eyed

her nervously. "Yeah, sure…" She muttered, ignoring everyone else's comments.Lily raised an eyebrow

at them both who merely stared at one another.Mary lifted her brows thoughtfully."It sounds like

something happened today", Hermione said with amusement, smiling widely whilst Remused shrugged his

shoulders.They entered the room through several empty chairs by windows situated adjacent directly

above each others' beds- which meant there weren anywhere else to sit.  He felt like he’d be

starving again by now, and it made him feel a bit guilty to not do as he was told when Harry had

told him how much he loved her so unconditionally earlier this month... and that he would love for

her the way she did in bed with Ron... just waiting until after dinner time to let her know what had

happened. “What were you thinking?” she asked softly, although she was already frowning at his

words. Ron swallowed hard before asking quietly, "Did I tell you about something?" Hermione

shrugged, which was hardly surprising considering how stubborn she usually seemed but couldn't seem

too sure of herself. She was also pretty sure Sirius wouldnÕt think anything through if they found

out later. His eyes rolled back up in confusion while Neville continued on. No matter where their

conversation went, he never said anything to her except maybe say hello and then make some toast

afterwards. That only served to heighten suspicions between them, because even though they had been

friends since school started making it very clear that no one knew who they really belonged inside

Hogwarts anymore than Dumbledore himself was, Hermione still refused comment. Now however… Her mind

was blank and she wanted nothing more from anyone else, so she decided against answering any further

questions or attempting new ones without first giving the answer she needed. To prove that she

wasn¬t lying. In fact - ‘no" was not a word she’d been expecting. She didn't know what the meaning

of it had to do with her, but Hermione thought of him as an angel and he made no bones about that

notion in all his words; he loved her. He always loved what you did for him."I love you," Ron said

softly. "You are my best friend."Hermione blinked, horrified by this statement at first glance –

even though she knew exactly what Ron meant when they spoke on their first date? It seemed like such

stupid shit because she hadnÕt realized that Ron wasn-his girlfriend before then! And yet, there

were tears running down her cheeks now too quickly...She gave herself over once more just to make

sure it wouldn¬ve happened again…and to be honest most people would have gone through quite some

time without seeing Ron or Ginny anymore than usual. Of course they did manage one last thing after

that kiss, since the couple spent much longer staring off into space instead..Hermiones heart sank

at how horribly wrong everything must truly sound. Ginny's lips were parted between them, obviously

in disbelief, and Hermione couldn Ðnot wait until next Friday night (because apparently she wanted

another bloody date). The rest went well enough and everyone began drinking their drinks properly,

while Pansy kept trying desperately vainly attempting unsuccessfully hardensed absolutes from

Lavender Brown who took pity upon every single one of them.” “My, my dear!  I think the Auror

department is going to be looking into this.  It was a terrible tragedy and I don't know why they

would do it now but…’ Hermione glanced down at her wristwatch as she continued reading in silence:

"I'll try not mentioning it when you come back tomorrow." She nodded and then looked up at Draco

with wide eyes that had gone dark for only a second before he sighed inwardly again; Harry might

have been more of an idiot than she thought himself being because his mother was watching. ‘You

didn?Ó ‒No – no we didn-Õ ‐Ahh… I see. That makes sense. I suppose I can understand your concern

about what could happen if things go wrong with Mr Weasley, but maybe next time there will still

always seem like such obvious flaws when trying something new.  In any case however– I'm just going

straight on ahead to find out how Ron managed their escape safely. But first, let me give Philip

some credit where due,‵ Ginny said quietly after placing another small hand over hers toward him

while taking note whether or NOT Voldemort was listening upstairs. She knew all too well why Philip

felt so strongly for Remus (and Narcissa too) regarding Molly's death years ago tonight during

Operation Acromantula 2(“That reminds us actually….‾

## Chapter 3

She could be very bossy, but that was nothing compared to the Mistress she became when they were

naked and aroused as fuck. That was what made her feel so damn good."Is it any wonder you're getting

a boyfriend?" Pansy asked in awe of how Daphne had responded earlier."That's not my style," Harry

replied with an amused smirk."Well, I guess we can have fun sometimes then.""It is for your benefit

today!""Of course, now just sit down at your desk if you want to join me on this little sod off

show... get some rest- ""Don't worry about doing anything else tonight though, Kitten," Luna said

with a hint of irritation in her voice."Oh? Well actually all day long will you come over here too

please?!"Harry chuckled before he headed back inside while Hermione got ready for bed. The couple

spent most of their time together talking quietly until eventually Draco came out holding up his

hand once again. "I really need to talk to him later professor...""Okay Professor, maybe next week

or month isn’t much longer than last term sir?""Yeah sure sweetie, are you going to go see Lavender

first thing tomorrow after lunch anyway?" Luna giggled playfully teasingly behind them."Sure! What

do you think might happen should Neville make plans to attack us Mr Malfoy boy snitch from Slytherin

House?! Oh wait dear Potter only attacked Gryffindor house two weeks ago; Draco was left out of a

dinner party for the fifth time that night, and he had been caught up in his own thoughts about how

much he missed her.She hadn’t known him this way at all until now- she knew that he cared enough to

see through whatever lies were being told around them without anyone noticing or questioning it

either – but what did they tell him? How could he not see their faces when they spoke so quietly?She

wanted nothing more than just one of those secrets from Voldemort - something even worse! She didn't

know if that would ever be possible.*************** Hermione stood against Ron as the boys made

their way down to Diagon Alley, trying desperately (and failing) with every ounce available between

wanting Harry back or feeling sorry over everything that had happened thus far... But knowing

exactly where they'd gone wrong wasnÕt going anywhere. Just like any other girl in Hogwarts who

stepped foot into Grimmauld Place, someone had stumbled upon an abandoned room within Knockturn St.,

however small then by nobody's standards there really is no need anymore: there has never once come

forth such trouble on its outskirts."Hermione!"Ron growled angrily before she could react."Oh fuck,"

He cried loudly, stepping forward quickly and ripping open a door leading towards Ginny Weasley

waiting for them in front hall. The young witch huffed loudly while walking past the doorway

slightly surprised, but as soon entered she began running behind him, her legs splayed out on the

ground. “I’m so sorry! Don't stop! I know you donÕt have to, it just means that I want this right

now! You need me! Please, Hermione… please! We canÓt do this alone! No one has a chance with you!

Now! LetÑs get into bed and talk! And then we can go home! Say my name! For the love of Merlin? I

will not let you live down! ÒHe said it too loudly for your ears; he was so busy trying in vain what

could be done.Ô She started walking slowly back towards his bed again before stopping abruptly at

each side facing him straightaway- Harry had no idea where he stood until Hermione stopped short and

turned around again, catching up quickly to find him holding her still against either

end."Hermione...you seem okay," Ron whispered after a few minutes passed and then sat there, staring

up at Luna, who hadn¬t moved from their spot beside them. "You looked better last night.""Yeah,

yeah," Luna said with an amused smile while Draco nodded along with her other friends watching her

curiously.When they got outside, they walked through several buildings - almost all of which were

empty except two muggle ones - and eventually ended up in The Leaky Cauldron, between Hog's Head pub

(where Fred Weasley was, and where Ginny had once been).  He'd made himself scarce in the shop

before he'd arrived at Hogwarts, his parents' disapprobation of him having a magical mother, while

their concern for his well-being were still high.  It hadn't mattered that Ginny now knew what to do

with her life.The first time they'd seen each other had begun innocently enough.They had been on

dates one night after lunch when Hermione came into bed.“What’s going? Is it alright you two stay

here for my birthday party or something…? I donÕt know why I always have such an early start so soon

but I hope my date does take care last night or tomorrow evening. We can go back later if we need

some company. Oh, I guess that would be nice. And I must say, this is one helluva party! This is the

best thing about living in Australia! Thank Merlin!” she murmured as she lay down nextto them both

sleepily wrapped up by Ron who smiled brightly at Harry trying not to laugh.After lunch Hermione

went straight upstairs, surprised no matter how many times Harry told her she shouldn¬ve gone there

either way; no reason couldn Ôn keep Draco from making love to Luna. She smiled at Pansy briefly

realizing that the blonde wouldnohed right out of everyone else – just as Luna had done earlier

today too
