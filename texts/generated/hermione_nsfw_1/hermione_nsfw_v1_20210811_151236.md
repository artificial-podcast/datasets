## Chapter 1

“Mine!” he growled and threw her onto the bed. “Now I’m going to have a bloody shower, alright?‘Why

did you come for me? Because… because it was your fault that the other person had hurt you‒Hermione

stood up from beneath his blanket as she lay on top of him desperately trying not get spooked by

this new information coming out about Ron being abused in front Hermione now- oh my god! He―s gone!

What are you doing?! Did someone do that!? It wasn't just Bill Weasley attacking me like that! That

man attacked Ginny! My baby brother is going down with another woman who would rape her unborn

child... Oh, Merlin, they thought we were making love; what if our hearts are beating so badly

together?? They couldnÑt believe George Weasley found out right then when he told them Granger was

pregnant again.?And yet here he stands at their mercy today! Just days after Harry lost himself in

an impossible dream involving Granger…Harry knew why: Godric Gryffindor wanted his girlfriend

pregnant until he was certain there wouldn¬o be any more trouble between them. At some point during

the third task, Potter explained it, but even Draco looked concerned over Draco— loss – having been

around him all along, well before he left Hogwarts, and knowing exactly what was happening to his

best friend. In hindsight though– "You don?" he asked, giving Malfoy a look that suggested the

answer was yes. He couldn't help but wonder if they'd been trying to hide the fact from him for as

long or longer than they had before Granger had come forward and told them everything that happened

in this time… But nothing else could have made it any easier then he thought; it would be like going

back through his past and finding the one thing he hadn’t really felt yet – regretting everything

with an angry heart when the only option left now of seeking relief under whatever roof she might've

fallen down was lying there on top all alone while her words haunted Draco's mind into another realm

altogether."No," Hermione replied confidently after several moments more studying their surroundings

until finally deciding not let herself go near anything at first so Harry dropped a hand onto Pansy

who began kissing against hers. The witch shifted even further away between kisses, pining over

every inch during which Potter continued pushing himself up off-balance again, and he couldnÕt help

smiling just thinking about how much he missed her.As they kissed downwards towards each other

deeper inside themselves both men relaxed and felt a sort of relief rush through them. Pitying

slightly though that didn?t seem likely right now anyway and Harry wondered whether either part

wouldn¬t feel better afterwards..."I think we should talk about something tonight," Harry said

softly as they looked around for someone in particular standing nearby to take a look at the small

group. “My mother would love that,” she whispered as she approached the table and eyed her son

closely with one eye on his chest while another eyed him questioningly before she took a seat next

Hermione sat opposite Draco, eyeing each other carefully from up to down. She was sure he felt right

about who they were but then again it was hard not seeing their parents once more after all this

time… Draco's eyes lit up slightly when he saw how much of a different person Ron had become since

joining Hogwarts than what he’d known back then (and judging by the way Harry had been acting

lately). Even though there wasn't any real animosity between them now he still thought that maybe

some time together might be worth something even if it meant losing everyone else completely because

they wouldnÕt have really cared enough or loved anything like Hermione. He didn Òm want that anymore

anyway. His thoughts wandered off just thinking about Ginny, so far only having heard from Fleur

earlier regarding their relationship. The blonde girl seemed rather lost yet kinder towards him

nonetheless. Maybe I should try and remember my father every day? Just let me know your name!

Hermione watched the Gryffindor walk out of the Great Hall looking annoyed despite the fact he

obviously hadnt gone into detail over the details of that night either, which could very well mean

she knew exactly whom Malfoy went through. She was the only one who could be trusted to make such a

statement, no matter how much Hermione had tried at times in her life."I'm sorry," she whispered

quietly, and Ron felt a surge of hope that she was right, but he didn't know whether or not it was

something she wanted him so badly for - "Don’t apologise, Hermione! You can't just go back to this

rubbish!" He pushed past her, his eyes finding hers as he pressed harder into Draco's skin with each

rough thrust until they broke apart completely from their embrace; there were tiny tears streaming

down their faces when all hell broke loose.He pulled away from himself, feeling helpless now because

she wasnÕt going anywhere. The thought made everything worse than it already seemed: she would be

gone forever if someone else did that again...She looked like an orphan while holding onto Ginny

Weasley so tightly, looking out on them from the ceiling. It hurt too bad both women couldn Òtake

care off me, Weasley!' the redhead grumbled. “Do you really want us dead? We weren¾t even

supposed-""That we are here! What happened?" she demanded angrily after she realised what had

happened between Ginny (who sat beside Harry with Theo)and Luna Lovegood? Not once did she say

anything else. How dare she?! Ginny stared up from behind her trying desperately vainly – but

## Chapter 2

“Mine!” he growled and threw her onto the bed. “Now I’m going to have you tied up in my knickers and

then I promise nothin‘ else is coming out of your mouth, little one…‒His eyes fell on Hermione

before she could react; his tongue licked at a mark that was completely unnoticeable when it touched

them together as if they were being played with toys from scratch just moments ago or had been doing

it for hours.He pulled her back into him and wrapped an arm around each shoulder like some sorta

petulant puppy dog trying desperately vainly protect their young brood by wrapping himself snug

against hers until there wasn't any other way but all over her body as they both gasped out, hands

still clasped behind their heads.‵Hermione whimpered slightly under Draco's touch while Ron

snickered softly through clenched teeth.Ron―s hand slid down between them slowly caressing the seam

where neither side laid, gently nudging Hermione towards what looked rather cute now because of its

large shape – his cock poking out from underneath her panties - before slipping beneath her

pantyhose. She didnÔt hear Harry scream anything throughout breakfast nor did anyone turn away Ginny

who was staring up at Sirius, who had appeared startled again after hissing incoherently."Oh god

yes!" she sobbed frantically whilst Ginny started shouting words about how much he wanted this new

toy and why no-one else was taking it, which made him feel very bad.He did like the way she looked

at him though because of the size difference in her shoulders."I can't believe you are so tall,"

Harry said as his hand went to the headband that had been on Hermione's dresser for a couple days

now. "You look great too.""We don’t have any other choice but to go with Ginny or whoever we want

most likely I will lose my virginity over it instead," Pansy snorted before grabbing another one of

Harry‘s clothes and tugging them off himself. He felt even more confused by their conversation than

when they were younger; however as soon enough, he realized just how different things could be if

Luna chose to take advantage during their times apart from each others' night together.As all of

this happened Harry found there were several people who seemed a bit uncomfortable talking about sex

while doing everything possible to make sure Ron and Neville stayed quiet around everyone involved.

Dobby popped into view shortly after noticing something strange going on out of nowhere where

someone dressed as a giant squid appeared up against some trees outside the Burrow.Harry took note

of what actually caused its appearance: The large creature flew towards an enormous tree covered

mostly in leaves growing back down slowly until it came upon the smaller branch leading directly

toward the next path through the woods.'What is happening?' Dumbledore demanded angrily looking

concerned.''It looks like... well, it is,' Harry said. 'We can't tell the difference between a

normal vial and the one in our kit because they're different types of vials; I'd say that's why we

have to keep them separate.'Lucius chuckled again before he got up off his bed quickly- Sirius was

waiting for him at the door while Lucius made sure James couldn’t see anything too large or

complicated by standing down from Draco sitting on the floor opposite her with their arms folded

tightly together as if trying not so much against the wind'.Harry took notice but decided to ignore

Severus' obvious frowns after all this time over things about Remus Lupin - apparently having sex

without permission wasn not something Snape did very often when watching people get pregnant

anyway."So what are you going to do now?''I think keeping my girlfriend safe isn""Sirius!""What?!"

Hermione shrieked loudly out loud slamming into Ron right there next to where she had started

shouting back earlier.""Malfoy! You've ruined everything," Pansy snarled indignantly grabbing Luna

who looked confusedly at Malfoy then goggling behind herself making everyone look worse than ever

staring directly ahead at her glaring daggers still in her face."You know how badly your sister

needs protection?" Madam Pomfrey asked clearly irritated instead picking apart both Neville

Longbottom (who could only be described most commonly being an evil scoundrel) and a lot of the

people I met in this area were not even from my own family, but rather pure-bloods. It was strange

seeing them all together after such short lives." Harry looked to Ron who had been talking with

Snape for some time now while he spoke his mind over what they'd learned about James Potter's past

as well,"Harry sir...""Potter is back at Hogwarts?" Pansy asked out loud that sounded more like a

threat than anything else. "Yes master Harry.""Thank you professor!" Dobby popped into view just

before everyone left so no one could interrupt him or anyone on their way there alone would have

noticed how much attention Moody was getting around here without any other male presence nearby

himself."So...How long did it take me to get home? What are your thoughts though if someone showed

up today looking for us tonight anyway?"He smiled brightly knowing once again these might not be

friendly teenagers anymore since many thought older wizards usually didn't show off very often

anyways when young ones got bored because of things going on behind the scenes which made life hard

for others too. He really liked having fun during those times however; right then maybe next year

Dumbledore wouldn’t approve leaving school unfinished duelling events where students knew each other

better already by whatever means possible until something truly awful happened…"I think we need to

go find Sirius Black sooner should everything somehow start to unravel between both our families'

heads… Well hello

## Chapter 3

“Mine!” he growled and threw her onto the bed. “Now I’m going to use your wand for my own

protection,‘cause that damn thing is bound in a thousand knots! When you come back from this

nightmare it will be just like you saw me do at the end of The Dark Lord movie! It won't matter if

you were tortured or not, because those people are still alive. They are not dead, but they―re gone

now so there isnÐt any need anymore - Harry! We‒ve got to find them first! You should have heard how

far we‑ve come by then; Weasley, stop being such an arsehole and move on. This whole situation needs

immediate attention! Hermione...– He watched as she slipped off his body until Draco was holding him

with one hand while Neville lay on top over their naked bodies – his wand had been severed from both

hands.Hermione huffed at Ron before running to pull the other two boys up to stand beside Luna who

continued rubbing herself against Mr Malfoy… the witch was now standing next to Ginny sitting across

from each others arms as well (thank Merlin).‵They all stared wide-eyed at what looked almost

humanly inhuman behaviour from what sounded exactly like torture.'You don? What happened?' Hermione

asked.Ron smirked. 'Oh Godric,' he mumbled.Ginny chuckled nervously. She shook her head. “No, no…no

you don't have to do that, I just want the best for my family.” ‘You know how much it means! You’re

my sister, my wife and our son; but this is important too so I can share your world with them. We

can all be proud of who we are, or at least see each other as an equal partner in love – because

people will always look up when a beautiful woman comes into our life, even if they donÕt understand

the depth behind that beauty itself - but she‵ll never compare themselves against yours. Your

sister…she‘s mine too. So tell me something first. What did Draco say?– She nodded slowly towards

Hermione before sighing again silently then walking over quickly toward his bedroom door leading

back inside him through open window silled doors and out onto street level walls...Ginny gave Ginny

another hug before she turned to Hermione like everyone else had done last night after such intense

heartache from not knowing exactly what was happening between their friend and Ron and how she felt

about it ever since she was forced awake by being held in front of Harry and Neville every morning

on the train home alone while he wasn¬bonding with Lavender Brown. He had wanted nothing more than

comfort during these terrible moments, her eyes still glowing from where tears were falling freely

everywhere, crying together often enough in the corridors of Hogwarts.“Fuck! That was terrible…”  He

watched her wince and roll around in his arms, looking down at him through a hole in one arm as he

tried to catch up with their pace but she seemed unable or unwilling not only because ‘the pain is

so incredible it doesn't leave my skin’.He heard Hermione‒s soft voice whisper something underbelly-

like behind them before she turned away from herself slowly towards Harry again quietly murmuring

something similar to that once they had sat in silence for over an hour and he felt himself grow

weak against hers again in response without warning after all this time alone apart when he finally

managed some semblance back into normal consciousness.  She was still shaking violently now, though

she did seem quite relaxed even by what looked like hours on end.Finally, while Harry lay completely

still sleepily in bed, Hermione sat cross legged beside him across both sides which had been folded

up neatly amongst the sheets near each other just above Ron who seemed incapable whatsoever more

than happy tears to spill forth upon seeing such naked flesh lying there waiting for them wherever

he could reach.Harry gasped loudly out of shock then groaned deeply onto top half Draco who was

already awake writhing underneath him rather hard inside having no idea why he hadnÕt gotten off

much earlier during breakfast yet. “It looks amazing! I love you too, Malfoy...— ’m so sorry.” He

stands up and gestures for her to follow him out of the room (while he still has his arm around

hers). “Now, can we sit down?‘Let me introduce myself. I am Molly Weasley; my daughter-inlaw

Hermione Granger is a twentysomething housekeeper with an international reputation as well…well

known in Scotland who was once married but now lives happily on welfare with little children in

tow.'Harry nods once again, smiling at Lucius' wry grin that matches his growing attraction towards

this witch: she doesn't look like Ginny or Neville, nor does Harry's ginger hair suggest anything

fancier than Draco rolling his eyes at all times. She really is very talented when it comes

business, her mind boggling over every inch from what Ron had told him about Viktor Krum‒s motherly

abilities after he was born and how much he hated them both.Hermione ignores her own giggles and

nods slowly, pulling Harry into another hug before she asks, 'What are they doing here?'Lucius

raises himself high enough above their heads and hugs back tightly against one shoulder while

holding Harry close, breathing deeply as he rests his head against the sideboard beside

Hermione'.They fall silent together until finally they reach Potter Manor, where Harry leans

casually forward and whispers instructions through soft gritted teeth onto Mrs Greengrass,'Mum needs

your help cleaning the kitchen floor!' Harry
