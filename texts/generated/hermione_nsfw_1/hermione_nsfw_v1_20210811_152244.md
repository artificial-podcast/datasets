'“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Sirius screamed'

## Chapter 1

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Sirius screamed. ‘Fuck, I could have killed her!’ he shouted at

Hermione and Ron in unison as they both jumped off of their beds to escape Voldemort or something

else that was making them so bloody nervous.  Severus watched on, unsure how to respond to whatever

was happening. He sat up and turned his head toward Harry who looked like a child out for blood but

couldn't help himself. There were no words left after hearing what happened before him...Harry held

his breath until Snape took over and had all of Remus‒s orders immediately. The potions master

stepped forward and lifted James onto his feet while Dumbledore placed Severus under guard just

behind Black, standing next one arm above Potter's shoulders. With an annoyed grunt from Professor

Slughorn, Severus walked towards Dumbledore and got into position beside Moody- he stood straight

away looking thoroughly shocked by everything going on.He didn want anyone to know anything about

this except Lupin; now it seemed everyone knew exactly where Tonks—s secret hideout had been located

because she wasnÕt even sure if any Death Eaters would be following since there weren Ðthousands

upon thousands of people keeping watch around the school. Once again, McGonagall did nothing when

she lectured Slytherins regarding the safety every student should have knowing such things existed

amongst Hogwarts students. And yet most of the professors simply continued to ignore those

warnings…The room was silent, and Harry wondered if he would ever be able to really breathe again.

He closed his eyes, taking in a deep breath as he tried desperately not to think of anything else to

say; he had no idea how long it took him before he finally got out of the Great Hall.There were

several students that he recognized from last year that seemed interested by what he saw. Hermione

Granger sat at her desk with Tom Riddle on one side while Severus Snape (who was still sitting next-

to her) studied at their table. Most glaringly so was Ron Weasley who looked exactly like his father

but more angular instead than Sirius Black, although there was something about them that reminded

Harry of his older brother.Hermione made an uncomfortable face when she realized where Dumbledore's

portrait stood."Sirius? Has someone come?""No," she answered with relief "It's your turn,

Minister.""Thank you, sir!" The Headmaster said with a slight smirk."Well done, Sir! I hope everyone

enjoyed this evening since my visit is soon over…" Dumbledore said and then smiled down at Harry and

Hermione. "Good night Mr Potter and Miss Granger."Harry snorted loudly trying very hard not only for

himself however they weren't alone but also because of Lily too. They'd known each other throughout

most years now and even though he could remember little details of every single day during which

he’d spent with her, he couldn�t remember the last time they had been alone together. He found

himself in a comfortable space at Malfoy Manor, near where there were still many people, but Draco

was also feeling lonely now and he didn't want to be alone.Harry noticed that Granger had gotten up

from the sofa she was sitting on so he looked over at Hermione who was curled into his arms watching

him. Harry knew it wasnÕt something normal for a witch of his age or younger as she had grown around

him too much; usually she just needed someone to talk about her problems. So, what did Harry think?

What could possibly be going through his mind when he first started seeing her? Was there something

bothering them? Would they ever see each other again? His heart ached more than ever before because

of the war, and after everything else they went through, things were getting worse all around

Hogwarts. It was really not good for anyone under house rules. A lot like Ginny and Lavender had

done during their OWL years, except Ron and Neville hadn¾t joined since those first year and neither

had Hermione (at least, not yet). They weren normal children anymore! How can they keep on being

that bad?!Ó Pansy Parkinson asked in an exasperated tone, tears streaming down Harry's cheeks. "I

never thought you would turn eleven.""Oh I guess then I wouldn-""I donât mean any harm!""What do you

think he is talking about?" she asked, shocked."He doesn't have a choice," Harry said. "He's going

to try and use you as bait.""No way...""You know it will work out too well if we both succeed in

getting him off of me without hurting anyone else.""And just how badly are you worried that I might

get hurt again by this?" Pansy wondered briefly at his implication.Harry sighed but didn’t say

anything more before pulling back for another drink. The alcohol had probably been enough for her

now.After finishing their drinks, she leaned against the wall next door while he waited patiently

for Pita outside."What happened?"Pita was still standing there waiting for Harry after they left.

She could hear them from the kitchen where several people were discussing what to tell her tonight

about Voldemort with no regard on Luna or Ginny. They'd talked long enough though, so she wasnÕt

surprised to hear Neville telling Sirius not only why Ron was having trouble with Dobby today (but

also because he knew who Malfoy really wanted to meet), which made sense since neither one would be

expected under the circumstances.The rest seemed rather surprised when Panko came over earlier than

usual. He was wearing an oversized silk shirt almost like its namesake and a thin black button-down

down dress jacket giving Pitasa some semblance thereof even though it looked much lighter than Luna

had suggested. There

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Sirius screamed, his face red. ‘Not that I am not annoyed, but my

father has been trying to kill me and he needs the help! It’s none of your business what happens in

this house- Dumbledore and Harry need each other. He told us we were nothing more than a bunch who

can't get along because they donÕt really like one another- especially after all those years of

friendship between you two. But now…what do you think might happen if there isn– oh Merlin! You just

got killed again!? My poor boy! Bloody hell – does it have anything going on?  Fuck it up, Weasley:

how could anyone let Ron know about this?! As usual (or rather as Sirius had expected) Remus and

Hermione stood around and listened intently while Peter watched James stand stock still from where

he was standing beside him and glared at him angrily. Everyone turned and stared at the pair before

looking back at their friends quickly once again.'Who are you?' Sirius demanded slowly. Removing

James and Peter from behind them, Fred asked curiously; 'Are you seeing Snape or something?''I'm

sorry,' Arthur said. 'He didn¬t say any of that-' George started suddenly, clutching both hands

tightly together.Hermione rolled her eyes.  Her voice sounded so calm she almost sounded sick. She

looked away, then turned towards James defiantly eyeing the others expectantly. "What? I didn't

think you'd be this easy for me to talk to!" He was clearly annoyed with him, but his eyes were

fierce and he spoke calmly as if it had been a secret since their first day at Hogwarts. After

another couple of days of waiting and things between them they finally agreed that Sirius was going

back into hiding after Voldemort's death. Hermione wasn’t sure what she should do now; would look

forward on something like that, even if she thought there could only ever once or twice happen to

him again. But then Lily Evans came by her office every week to work some extra shifts while James

was away from school in the hope for peace. They just talked about Harry and Remus and all sorts…And

did not make eye contact when Bellatrix Lestrange walked up behind them looking worried. “I guess

we'll have to wait until next year though! We both know how much time is left before your exams are

due," She said softly and nodded happily out loud. ~~~ 12th June 1999 Snape Manor - Barnstone,

Nottinghamshire  The three of them sat down heavily upon the sofa watching the house gradually

turning crimson over around them each passing second slowly getting closer and nearer to the door

where Madam Pomfrey stood right outside the window taking care of everything whilst giving her usual

comforting looks which made everyone laugh loudly along side her and trying very hard not to see any

sign of the tears streaming down his cheeks. "Malfoy?" she whispered, looking down at him again as

if he were a stranger in this moment alone with Hermione Granger. She knew better than anyone that

she was doomed by my presence right now because she knew exactly what I wanted, what it would take

for me just like mine did when I tried so hard last time, but nothing happened without my soul mate

inside of you. He looked into hers, taking in the way she felt about me. The way I couldn't help but

wonder how much more human each one could be or who they really were; whether their pain or anger

might somehow have been influenced by the power of someone else's magic beyond our own. No matter

where we went from here, there was always something left behind which meant anything had changed

once upon an occasion. His eyes darkened even further though, and all he saw were dark circles on

his face, while Hermione's chest heaving up against her back grew steadily heavier every day since

leaving Hogwarts. What made it worse? He didn’t know why she needed those scars anymore when it

suited her best. She wouldnÕt dare hurt anyone without them going through enough suffering for both

sides between us , and yet no matter how many times she touched herself, she never thought she could

touch someone truly strong outside themselves. Ron smiled slightly before letting go immediately and

quickly stroking himself off. Hermione watched him intently, her eyes wide as she felt the weight of

his cock resting on top of hers for a moment before opening them to look into Draco's lustful

eyes."Fuck! You're so hot," he groaned, pulling back with a grunt, "I can't believe you got me in

this position... I'm sure it was all my imagination but...""Didn' we ever tell everyone about how

our bond was forged?" She asked after a long silence had passed between their heated moments that

caused her heart rate spikes every time he rubbed against one breast."You've been dreaming more than

anyone else since then," Ron chuckled darkly as they both went quiet.Hermione sighed heavily and sat

up, rolling over slightly while Ron climbed onto his elbows and pulled her down at once."Are you

ready for what's coming next? Do something naughty or embarrassing tonight?" she asked, knowing that

Harry would be watching closely from the corner out of view if she wasn’t careful.Harry grinned at

her playfully, looking thoroughly unconcerned by her comment.""Maybe just let some good luck charm

us all go though.""Ron!" He called again when Hermione jumped towards him and rolled across to sit

beside him. “Just give me your hand now. It won-""Harry, stop doing that," she admonished, stepping

forward and giving Ron an apologetic glare. "It will only make things worse."He shook his head and

## Chapter 3

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Sirius screamed, running over and grabbing Harry by his hair. ‘I

can’t believe this!  I love him so fucking much!– Ron cried in frustration as he ran up to Harry. He

looked down at himself.  ‒You want me dead?  What do we have left? You don't even know how many

people there are or what kind of people they really are! Just leave us alone all together! We need

each other! Let go now! Stop crying for nothing! Look out! This bloody hellhole is about six feet

tall, it will never be quiet again. Please calm down; just give a little time. There is nothing that

needs your help but my life, Hermione Granger has made everything right, she is the only one who

deserves to live happily ever after. Don-I hope Potter gets some answers from her before Voldemort

comes back…it might take another week if not longer than twenty minutes…Harry could feel tears

welling in his eyes. They were too thick to let them fall on their faces. After hours spent in

hiding behind bars, refusing any contact whatsoever, he was finally free of those doors when the

door opened. The air around James's body felt heavy and cold as his lips curled into an angry grin,

trying desperately hard to stay awake. When the wall was removed from its frame, Harry gasped. His

arm had been ripped off and blood was streaming across her face. Her hands were bound to the side of

his head, she saw him stumble over it."I'll help you with that," he whispered as a voice called out

behind her from across the hall towards another room. "You can't have me here.""I'm not going

anywhere!" Hermione yelled back, holding up her hand in protest.Sirius had gone down on one knee

while he stood there watching Hermione, tears seeping into both eyes. He held her by two legs for a

few seconds before he pulled away and looked at his friend- who was still kneeling beside Sirius-

then he lifted himself slightly so she could see what would happen next."Ow! Oh Merlin, I think...

oh God, no more kissing Ron now..." Harry muttered under intense concentration.Ron's shoulders

slumped forward; thankfully the pain was starting slow enough. Hermione swallowed thickly as he

finally started breathing again once more, but nothing seemed to stop him. The pain continued and

Harry gasped softly when he heard someone shout;"Harry Potter!" he shouted outside of them, making

their way through a crowd."It is good to hear your name being spoken right?" Hermione asked

cautiously looking around the group in confusion. Harry turned quickly though, feeling the heat

radiating off him even faster than usual. She smiled warmly knowing this was the only other person

they wanted to talk about afterwards."Thank you everyone. You are all welcome. But don’t worry about

what happens to you or me, Granger – I can handle it and I know that if anything goes wrong with

Hermione…” He said quietly as he stepped away from her in a blur of pain; she looked at him for

confirmation but his gaze remained fixed on hers despite the fact they were both unconscious beneath

them: Draco could feel himself melting under their embrace until only moments later was there any

sign anymore movement back down. They stared into each other's eyes for a moment before looking back

up again when something caught between Ron Weasley who seemed genuinely concerned by everything

going poorly (and who had no doubt been lying when telling Dumbledore how to treat Hermione) while

Harry Potter tried desperately not to be affected too much due wholly because nothing happened to

Hermione. “I need your help! I have not been able even close enough - not just yet—to figure out

which of our friends is responsible...‘Harry looks pale... like someone has taken a bite of one red

apple‒ Draco couldn't help grinning broadly.'Thank Merlin,' Malfoy snorted.Ron didnÕt answer after

three seconds, knowing exactly where Harry might look right now, but still giving it all credit

towards Arthur Dent instead-giving. Draco hadn?t given it much thought whatsoever, so he waited

patiently until everyone else began walking off together to see whether Hermione would do as

asked.When neither did anyone get quite deep enough to say anything, Hermione took his hand and

gently pulled it away from her chest. “I’m not sure if you‘re right or wrong in this situation… but

I want us both home safely and securely tonight; we have other things on our mind.  There are a

number of possibilities, some more than others: the Ministry may consider taking me back to my flat

- that is for certain – but then they would need information about your personal safety; there has

been no time frame for any such transfer, and neither do I believe anyone else should be here at

all. But since they can do nothing to help, I don't think there will ever happen an

emergency.”Hermione shook Harry briefly before saying quietly 'yes'. He nodded, smiling slightly as

she went along with what he had just said.'Very well,' Draco murmured, 'that sounds good. Now take

off your robe and socks while I―ll get you everything needed. You look like shagging

someone.''You're a great guy,' Lucius commented, shaking Harry's hands softly.Harry grinned shyly

and nudged him lightly across their laps.'Thank you very much,' Sirius replied, holding out his arm

towards them. {oOo} The next day was busy as everyone seemed equally happy with the news that Draco

Malfoy was pregnant with Andromeda Tonks Black... and Narcissa Potter. The twins were ecstatic when

Mrs Weasley returned later that night with a
