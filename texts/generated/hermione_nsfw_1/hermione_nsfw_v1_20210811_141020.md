'The sharp pain and the humiliating position made him come once, spilling onto her legs'

## Chapter 1

The sharp pain and the humiliating position made him come once, spilling onto her legs. He kissed

her lightly before grabbing her knickers off with his free hand."I'm going to go out for a walk," he

said. "And I don't want you anywhere near me.""What?""I'll be back in half an hour or so but I have

something else planned that I need at the Burrow after lunch today.""You already told us not one of

them is coming anyway? That's why we had to pick up some things earlier than usual this

morning!""Not bad considering it could take days without seeing my mother again.""Where are your

parents?" Pansy asked as she grabbed his arm.Harry smiled mischievously at her over their drinks and

headed down the stairs. It was then that he saw Harry leaning against the wall next door, his dark

hair clinging tightly to his face. The sight left a bitter taste in his mouth, though, leaving

behind only his eyes."Well?" Harry finally asked, smiling kindly at Luna."Oh yes, they're here

somewhere safe enough," Luna said happily, setting everything on fire. She had never been able get

away from him since the war ended. They were due back home soon, when she knew what happened tonight

would cost them both dearly."Um...is there anything wrong?"PansYap felt herself groan slightly while

Harry shrugged.She turned around and found Sirius sitting right beside her. Her stomach clenched

under every movement, the muscles tensing in anticipation as her knees bucked and she felt him

pressing against hers, his hand on top of Hermione’s head to guide them through a twisting tunnel

into their bedroom together with an icy stroke that only made Hermione shiver slightly when he

sucked back hard.He was so close…she could feel it already now – her hips were clenching beneath his

touch. It sent tingles through Draco's body, which began sending shivers down Hermione who moaned at

how aroused her boyfriend had become, and pushed up towards himself, making Hermione jump again as

he slid inside herself, even though he knew she would never make it pleasurable for long enough

before kissing and sucking back on both nipples. He grabbed her ankles quickly and pulled her

closer, grinding his hardness onto one nipple while continuing rubbing her other through each inch

until they connected fully."Fuck," Ron groaned, as his eyes rolled over Hermione's face. "I can't

believe I let you do this to me…""I know," said Ginny smoothly from behind Harry because there

wasnÕt anything she couldn Ôtell about what happened next either; he hadn¬t actually done anything

inappropriate or inappropriate to Hermione since being in Slytherin; but obviously, he wanted more

than anything else anyway.""Good," cried Hermione triumphantly after she had gotten off Draco once

more - "you really are getting sloppy!"Ron watched Ginny roll around on the bed and it took a while

for Ron to realize she was upset. "Harry, you're not going anywhere."He sighed as he reached down to

grab her hand again but stopped when his stomach clenched. He groaned again and pushed himself up

into Hermione's arms, wrapping his fingers around hers gently before pulling back hard enough that

Harry felt a knot in him at first sight of how she had pulled away from herself."What?""I'm sorry,"

Ginny said with tears rolling out of her eyes. She didn't want any more pain so she squeezed his

hand tighter against them both crying into each other without even thinking about anything else

which caused Ron no less discomfort.Ron shook his head and looked over to see Fleur looking like

this tired woman who probably hadn’t been able sleep after all. She shrugged slowly then put an arm

around Hermione and kissed the side where Ron was lying completely still.Hermione lifted her face

slightly and gave him a little smile. “You know I donÕt care what you think. You were right there

last night. We can talk later though.""Maybe we should just go home? Dinner would be nice if you two

weren-""It might be okay Gin", Hermione interrupted her, clearly surprised by their conversation

earlier tonight because they obviously wanted nothing better than seeing each another once

again."Okay. Well goodnight everyone. See you tomorrow morning... Bye! And stay safe here too!""Yes,

sir," Luna said as she walked in and shut the door behind her. "What was that for?" Harry

asked."Nothing much at this time of day," Pansy answered with a small grin before turning back to

her friends once again after they left. The next few hours were filled by some pleasant

conversations about everything from Harry's past relationship issues (which he had previously gotten

over), along Hermione Granger going through several pregnancy tests, including one which showed him

having twins; Ron Weasley giving birth on Halloween night while still holding his baby- he'd been

pregnant twice during his entire life.When their bags arrived early Sunday afternoon, Harry noticed

how the wedding dresser came into view waiting for them. He remembered being shocked when he first

got home just last week but then realized what it was: An oversized mini bottle of champagne. Harry

thought maybe something was wrong because all his belongings had already gone missing.""Oh? Oh no,

really?" Panna said happily. She stood up and took a seat near the couch."I don't think so. I guess

we should try not thinking too much until we have more important things to worry over.""Right,

love..." Luna smiled reassuringly.Harry wondered if Penty was right or not since there were quite a

lot else things she could be worried about without saying anything. It would definitely help greatly

later today though, especially considering Ginny will probably be busy practicing magic together

tonight anyway and

## Chapter 2

The sharp pain and the humiliating position made him come once, spilling onto her legs with a loud

thud. He’d lost his cock in the process of breaking free and he was shaking violently as he ran from

the bedroom to where she sat on top bunked on an armchair. “I think I just wanted you out there,”

Harry said softly, trying not be too harsh about it since it wasn't nearly painful enough for him

right now that Voldemort was alive and still inside Hermione Granger or maybe one day she might be

able manage without being so bloody violent anymore. But even if she did manage some sorta sex

change at least, this would only have been a temporary thing until they both realized their error –

which took longer than expected, but definitely worth while. It didnÕt make sense to keep Ron

hanging around by himself like that either, considering what he‘d done earlier. On top of all

else…the fact had hurt quite strongly when he heard how much he wanted everything to go back to

normal. And yet here he stood staring down into space, completely alone. How could he? That stupid

question kept asking itself, because every time he looked up towards Sirius Black, the man always

seemed rather stoic. No matter how many times they talked about Dumbledore having died, no matter

who asked them whether Dumbledore deserved to live - sometimes it never stopped talking about Sirius

anymore! Even though Remus Lupin told them otherwise countless times...It was a wonder the boys

would have been able to get away with such a thing, even if it had been one of their own.Harry

snorted."We all know what happened that night," Parvati replied. "I guess I'm not going back there

today and we can't go out anytime soon.""Well, now you're right; Harry's already worried about us

having sex again tonight so why bother?""Because he knows his brother has got me in trouble over

something similar..." Pansy shot him an exasperated look as she finished her essay."You could say

that this is more than just your typical friendship crap-""Oh no, don’t worry Weasley, dear boy.

That's exactly what my best friend was trying desperately hard at when he tried everything on his

life to kill Sirius Black last summer. He died because he couldn?t protect himself or anyone else

from James Potter, after which people started starting to believe things like that were true.""The

Dursleys are crazy enough! They killed Neville Longbottom for being too good looking!""Exactly.

There aren two brothers who live off the backsides by themselves but they still take care of each

other well enough. We've seen how much time spent together these days - most recently yesterday,

where both of us took turns kissing while talking under our breath until Tonks finally convinced

Dumbledore to let them spend some time alone since everyone seemed to be exhausted anyway.""So do I.

If you're going in, let me know." Harry nodded as he went back inside and watched the rest of the

men with him."Alright then, good night," Pansy said before turning around and heading out into his

dorm room.Harry had never been this excited when it came down here so often that they actually ended

up alone for a while after curfew was over. But tonight wasn't about them being together anymore

than usual or anything. It was just more stressors getting thrown at him because there were no other

people left who could help him right now.Dobby popped by shortly thereafter though, wanting to make

sure all their guests knew where she was- not only did he have to get permission from her, but also

if anyone else needed anything too.He found himself humming along happily even without Dobby's

assistance; making small talk on how much fun things would become soon enough is one thing,

especially during such a stressful time like today. He'd heard rumors throughout his childhood

telling what happened between Draco Malfoy Sr., Angelina Johnson Jr.. and George Weasley... well

apparently Fred thought something similar regarding Lucius Malfoy killing Sirius Black last

year?"Freddie...""What? Oh Merlin!"She frowned briefly thinking quickly across the table "I'm sorry

daddy! Just look my face every morning seeing your horrible scar""Oh really?!" She laughed again and

bit her lip nervously looking away slowly frowning inwardly considering everything happening behind

closed doors. "I can't believe I'm letting you in here, and then everyone will just sit around

waiting for a fight," he grumbled, as he pulled his wand out of the pocket on his robes to cast a

silencing spell over them both before returning back into her room."She's been talking about this

with you all week," Ron said quietly, shoving his hand up Harry's face at Hermione after she'd

already taken care not only that night but also the next morning when they were still going through

their classes together duelling lessons again.Hermione snorted. She knew it was true; she had

thought there would be some sorta fight taking place between him now or later during her break, but

somehow something felt different than what it had seemed from her earlier thoughts...It wasn’t like

a physical fight either; instead each person was silent until another one started speaking softly

against whatever voice came forth within earshot.Ron watched as Hermione stared at Harry‘s hand as

if hesitantly asking permission, until finally her eyes snapped up to meet hers."Luna," Luna spoke,

more reserved than usual. Her brown eyes sparkled with worry when two identical twins appeared

outside her window. There must have come a time in her life where this kind duress between three

friends could even get very dangerous indeed.""What do we need?" asked Parvati with an odd look in

disbelief upon seeing Hermione”right

## Chapter 3

The sharp pain and the humiliating position made him come once, spilling onto her legs. She wrapped

her arms around his neck again as he ground into it."Do you want to fuck me?" he asked as she pushed

at them.He groaned but kept pumping in and out of her slowly, making sure that every inch was

connected. He needed to feel everything inside her. Everything there for him if nothing

else.""Fuck!"She cried when he stopped and pulled back from her again with a desperate cry."No! No!

Don't stop," he finally managed."Yes, yes...Please...""Tell us what happened next," she begged while

he continued on pounding deep into her even harder. "Tell me how beautiful I am so please don’t let

go until we know exactly where this is coming from."He could hear herself crying against his chest

now. It had been hard since they started fighting earlier. But then, knowing just who would be

able to find him after all this time, and also knowing about Hermione, he knew their bond would

never end well. The first thing he did before leaving Hogwarts was to get dressed ready for bed, but

soon enough, Ron noticed something else was wrong."What are you doing?" Ron asked hesitantly not

moving one bit between his hands or feet despite the fact Harry was glaring down at him.Hermione was

looking up suddenly and he saw the same look written on her face. His eyes fluttered shut slightly

more than usual and she felt herself start to relax. He was there, leaning over her with his arms

around the waist of their bed."Good morning Hermione," he whispered as he kissed her neck before

taking a deep breath for good measure once again in a slow pace. "Morning, love.""You're asleep

sweetheart?""Yes, ma'am.""I see your mind is clear now; I'm not sure how much you want me at this

moment, but that's okay. Do you like it when we wake up? That's my favourite part about being awake

on such short notice...and sleep sounds so wonderful even though I don't know what else to do

without you next door."Harry wrapped his arm around her back while he stroked slowly down her body

until they both could feel the softness against them through whatever protective layers lay over

each other’s skin after one night together had been taken care off by magic alone- all of which he

would have gladly accepted if given an opportunity like this."Okay then let's go home..." Harry said

as they left via Floo, and headed straight for breakfast where the two of them did some talking

whilst the girls still sat behind their beds trying very hard under duress to keep themselves from

overhearing anything too intimate or embarrassing afterwards."Mmmm…" Harry mumbled into her ear

softly closing her eyes gently between hers while she took his hand and guided him inside of

himself. She didnÕt have the energy to face it, but she did feel his hands pressing her back against

one wall and holding her tighter in place as she closed her eyes shut again."What do you think you

want from me?" he asked with a low voice now that she was aware how much he needed control of

herself,"Oh God, I love you so much," she whispered, trying not too hard for comfort. Her breath

came out quickly when he let his fingers trail over hers and under them until they were just resting

there, feeling every inch wet against their skin. He kissed her forehead and nipped at where her

hair rested lightly on top before pulling away. "I need to know what you like about me.""Can I ask

if you can tell me something else? Can I lie down next time we go shopping?""No," he groaned with an

exasperated sigh, "but please don't say anything more than your name or my last names because...my

husband is going through some serious shit right now and..." His hand ran up to cup her chin while

his other finger went straight to rub her ear. Hermione gasped loudly when it felt like a full moon

and she cried out violently around him; this wasn’t Harry or Ron Weasley anymore nor would any

Gryffindor ever be able get used- but Sirius Black.She could hear the deep contentment coming from

James's lips even though she had never seen him act such pure-hearted towards anyone. It was as if

he were a part of her life, and yet at the same time it seemed that he didn’t even care about

anything other than her “life partner!” She tried to shake him off but he simply shrugged his

shoulders at her in response saying they should probably go away before they got back together. They

walked down the stairs one by first looking over the view from the staircase up into Sirius Black‘s

flat. Hermione thought for a moment what she would have done next if she hadn't gone there earlier.

Once inside the black manor came upon the scene unfolding around them. A pair or two men stood on

either side facing each others naked bodies with their wands pointed at them, holding hands. “What

are you doing here?‒ Voldemort asked calmly watching Harry Potter through the bars and windows of

Hogwarts.Harry froze then looked straight at Voldemort who just stared blankly out the

window…Voldemort chuckled slightly causing Harry not being able really say something else since

Snape spoke softly behind Dumbledore's desk while pointing daggers directed against himself all

along. He turned slowly turning sharply so he could stare right past Dobby when several wizards

appeared standing outside waving wandless spells clearly aimed at Severus Snape and Remus Lupin both

smirking wickedly too.The three Wizards waved their weapons like a herd of centaurs across the room

however those spell cutters stopped firing curses
