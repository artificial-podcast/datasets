'This was why she was somewhat jealous of Bellatrix, whose boobs were'

## Chapter 1

This was why she was somewhat jealous of Bellatrix, whose boobs were bigger than her own and who

would definitely look like someone with a giant erection. She had to admit that his height didn't

make any sense or something.""I hope you enjoyed my speech," Pansy said."You did okay?" Harry asked

as he climbed over the couch in front him. "But I think your ears are going crazy from what's

happened between you two earlier today.""And this is getting pretty bad too...""Well, Sirius has

been acting strange lately so... well, it seems we've gotten along for awhile now," Luna

answered.The girls both giggled at their friends, which gave them an idea about how much they missed

each other more than ever before. It wasn’t until after lunch when everyone else started talking

gossiping on various topics while Dobby went back upstairs where some guys joined them all together

to talk chess instead into a game against a group of people called the Triwizard Tournament. A lot

could have gone wrong if none came out tonight but even though Dumbledore wouldnÕve let Voldemort

escape punishment by blasting off curses without thinking, there weren Òreal problems about it

anyway.'So basically, our plans should go ahead then,' Neville commented.Harry grinned broadly just

watching Parvati take one last sip of tea; 'it sounds amazing.''Yes, actually,' Hermione

agreed.Neville chuckled again and began pacing towards Ginny sitting next-to Lucius Malfoy. The

blonde had sat in front of Harry and Ron, his hands clasped tightly on the teenager's

shoulders.Lucius looked down at Harry, who was still staring blankly into space. 'I don't think I

can stand that much.'Harry shrugged. He'd been angry with Snape when they were younger, but he

wasn’t going to do it again now. There was a lot he needed to work on right now, so why not sit for

what felt like hours? It might help him get through whatever this is, though. That way there would

be no more worries about where Hermione went or how she knew Draco was missing; all those thoughts

would have gone away once Narcissa showed up.''Hermione loves you,' Sirius said softly, taking one

look from Harry.Draco snorted as well before speaking out loud. “No, really, actually. She does too.

And we just need to make sure everyone knows everything okay?'Harry nodded and turned towards their

mate. They stared at each other silently until Lucius whispered, 'Look here, love'.He leaned over

them, eyes wide as he took another drink. His lips moved lower against Harry's shoulder and then

settled heavily onto his neck. Then he kissed her deeply across both cheeks...And soon enough,

things calmed back to normal. Neither wanted to go off without saying something else, which made

Neville chuckle quietly behind himself.Pansy grinned broadly while Remus giggled and Hermione went

to brush her teeth, as well Harry was now asleep next to him.The two girls sat at the table with

their heads in both hands, all looking down on each other."How do you like it?""Perfectly," Pans

said fondly after a moment of silence between them before they snuggling closer together."I love

sex.""Not bad though I can't say that about anything else today either.""Good for you guys then?

Let's get out there!" Sirius yelled from behind Lily who continued glancing up into the sky above

them.Hermione groaned inwardly but nodded once she felt his eyes go wide."Yeah okay mate?" she asked

finally.Sirius laughed."Well let's see what we've got here...and maybe if Samples is getting those

tits bigger than usual..." he pointed towards the bedroom where several bottles were stacked high on

top one by one surrounded an empty shelf.Lily scowled at him, "that sounds amazing! So pretty huh

right?!""Oh wait no not only have my nipples been enlarged already since yesterday night when our

first day back home -""It wasn’t supposed-" Sirius cut himself off angrily trying again not making

eye contact with her."But how did your mum know exactly which ones are too big- oohhh yes way so

good lookin' smart arsehole James Potter wouldn 'ave any trouble grabbing these little bits apart",

Harry said to her, as he pulled the pieces of clothing out and put them on. She took a few moments

longer before she decided it would be best for him if he just grabbed his wand first.  "But what

about the baby? You should try that once you've got your head inside", she told him."I'll have to do

that later today," Harry replied. "This is why I'm not going to share anything with anyone

else.""Oh... let's keep this in mind" Hermione sighed happily.She found herself standing at Draco

Malfoy Manor when he popped into view looking at the empty bed he was lying in, clearly exhausted.

He looked very tired but seemed well-rested too."Hey there Granger", he greeted after setting down

the items onto their own and then gesturing towards a chair across from them."Let me go now please".

He gave a quick nod.As they had moved off to the study room, Hermione noticed Ron sitting next one

of those chairs which had three other people staring at each others' faces."What are you doing

here?", he asked curiously while holding up a piece of parchment aimed at Hermione.Hermione blinked

her eyes wide eyed at how much she wanted answers or knowledge regarding her actions earlier and

walked over quickly to him again where he sat opposite of her. Ron closed his eyes briefly

remembering some of the things James had done since graduating Hogwarts together last year.. But

something struck her especially hard

## Chapter 2

This was why she was somewhat jealous of Bellatrix, whose boobs were usually quite large.  She had

noticed that the guys and girls around her liked to tease Hermione with their sex, but now she could

be a bit more creative in that regard. She couldn't really blame him for wanting something from his

girlfriend. He certainly wasn’t going out there to do things like this without her permission – not

at all! He was right…but it didnÕt have anything important on its mind, so he just wanted some

formative experience! “It sounds fun sometimes anyway...? You know I love you! And I would

definitely enjoy watching your tits bounce down my cock again soon if we ever got together before

Halloween or Christmas time. So, donÐt worry, I promise! Let me see them tomorrow; they should look

amazing when I come back later today. They are perfect and I want every single one inside! There is

nothing wrong about that gift! It has been ages since our last encounter! This year has proved us

both wrong! We need help getting them set up properly! I can already see your eyesight! My mum told

Mum how wonderful this idea became after she read The Daily Prophet - I believe she went into hiding

because Ron won Òthe Quidditch match against Gryffindor first thing Wednesday morning!Ó Draco

mumbled. "I bet Ginny will give Weasley a lot oomph!"Hermione chuckled softly as she stood up and

started to walk towards the door. She pulled out her wand and cast a calming spell, cleaning

everything from inside. Harry began pacing nervously in front of his bed and Ron was sitting on one

end."Ron?" she whispered."You okay?""I'm fine, just...just..." Hermione looked down at herself with

worry etched across her face while still being in her pajamas.""What happened? Did you hurt

yourself?" he asked, trying not even think about what had happened between them."No, I didn't," she

sighed absently before taking a deep breath for emphasis again once more but didn’t look back. "It

was just too much. You should've known better.""I know exactly how to deal with people like that

when I don-""Do you really want me here?" Parvati shot back angrily. Shaking off all thoughts they

were having around their relationship now it seemed it would be best if she simply shut up first. A

few minutes later after a light kiss Hermione opened her eyes slightly and smiled at him

sincerely."So are we going home soon then?" He asked as he pushed himself away from her so he could

watch her sleep.Hermiones chest heaved heavy into her stomach as if someone had pressed a pillow

against her. Her eyelids fluttered closed briefly; clearly not expecting any reaction or emotion

from either side because they werenÕt sleeping. The room suddenly filled with a feeling of

loneliness, a pang that lingered in her chest for some time. How was she supposed to feel safe with

him? What could have happened if he had gone on like this? ÒHermione…Ó ÔI need you here right now!Ù

ÜWeØve got it all figured out already – but I don’t want anyone else knowing about what weÐre

doing.Ý âLook at me again; IÑm not going anywhere until everyone is safely there and everything will

be okay before the end or I just leave you alone. You canìn get away with this without giving

yourself too much trouble. Itþs your fault. And Ginny has said she wants us both dead. I would

gladly give up my life to save Hermione from being put into such horrible situations. ÀNow go, love–

go and wake them up before I do anything rash, please: I need Ron back for tonight anywayÉà la mia

tambour de lumière à ma chérie vain te fait une coeur huit étoiles après pour moi en financierai

 -tu es bellissimais ce que tu jouir, mon fille nous et mon français est dans un grande être plus

-ermita tellement.” She took a deep breath and stared out the window.  “I am so sorry.  I just

missed you, my sweet Hermione Granger…it was so wonderful to see all of us together again! Thank

goodness we had such fun on our first date at Hogwarts in November and now that spring is here

everyone is getting married! It feels like this year has been a long time coming! Let me be

perfectly clear: I am not thrilled about being with Draco Malfoy or his friends – it's going too

far! But if you are feeling especially proud for him please come home and have some chocolate from

your favourite cocoa bar! And yes there will always still Beauxbatons – he won't hurt us even if

Ginny catches wind of them, either!! Right…oh and donÕt worry about running off next week; they were

excellent hosts as well. You should keep up appearances when Molly starts her day at school anyway–

oh, and do try telling her how nice she looks by now, alright? Goodnight! May Godric bless you both!

So goodnight Professor Blaise Zabini AND THE BEABIAS!!! The end This concludes what was already a

very lengthy discussion session regarding Ron Weasley (and indeed Harry Potter) becoming Head

Boy/Boyfriend today afternoon. First, Pansy Parkinson gave an unasked question concerning how the

two would approach Ron after he had gone through puberty-forming

## Chapter 3

This was why she was somewhat jealous of Bellatrix, whose boobs were just as big as his and her hair

was longer and darker than hers. She wanted to show him how much the Malfoys cared about her; he

knew that they'd do anything for her in return.""You don't need them, Potter," Hermione said

sarcastically."I see you've been planning this one before," Pansy teased."Oh no. I'm sure it will be

great fun watching Harry's little stunt like this. It'll give me a good excuse not being able keep

myself entertained while we're at it.""So?""We could try and convince Albus Dumbledore to let us

watch every single thing together tonight? He would enjoy seeing what your face looks like on the

dance floor!"Harry looked around with wide eyes, which only made Luna smile even more because

Neville had already caught up so well by now..."Why are you laughing here anyway? You really think

my father might have an idea where our time is going?!""Let's make some drinks first too! And after

dinner... Well, probably something else then-""Dobby can wait till lunchtime if there isn’t anyone

ready yet?", Lavender asked from behind Ron."Yeah right. Just leave Diddy waiting out until everyone

comes back downstairs", Parvati suggested pulling open the door next to Harry. "Or maybe later when

all four Gryffindors get home or whatever.""That sounds nice!", Pandy grinned. "Let's see how you

two are doing out there", she said as she jumped on Harry."And who is this girl?", Parvati asked

with a smile.Harry just nodded and leaned back in his chair, looking at the floorboards under his

breath. It wasn't until he was sure that Hermione would start to respond that he noticed something

strange. She looked up from her book once again, and without even opening her mouth, she gestured

for him not be surprised by it all either; though she seemed so pleased with herself."Well that's

about it, what do we want next?""I have some ideas I'd like to hear," Parvish replied."Oh- uh... now

get over here please..."Pansy started walking away but got distracted when Fred came running into

the room behind them, which made Lavender run around aimlessly towards Harry. He appeared only

moments later with both girls sprinting toward him.Parvati stood still watching while Bill began

taking notes of what they were supposed to tell Neville first."It seems rather clear where Mr Potter

has been going since last week anyway - let us take care of our schoolwork then," Fleur chimed

in."WHAT?!" Luna shriek loudly before quickly vanishing off an unoccupied broom closet door."We need

more time! We're trying too hard to think things through!" Pansie exclaimed proudly."Then why don’t

we try to stay put? I won't want you having any doubts about anything, Hermione. You know how much

this feels like a good idea." He chuckled with that knowledge as he stood up and began pushing her

out of the room. "I thought you might have noticed.""How do people manage it?""Well... well, most of

us are stupid enough not knowing what we're doing is just too weird," Harry sighed as Pansy laughed.

That was something she would never admit before, but today had been different for both their

families and his friends. Maybe they could learn some lessons from it over the summer after

all."Yeah, sure, yeah. But then again, there's always someone else who wants to help me find my

magic later on.""So let me guess..."Harry started pulling at his jumper in frustration while

Pizzoria slid off him. She finally turned around when she saw them go through the door

together."What did you two say earlier?" Harry asked as she walked across the hall."They were asking

if I wanted more practice tonight or make plans tomorrow night so no one has any problems getting

ready yet," Pudge said as they came into the hallway alone.She shook her head sadly because whatever

issue this was between the two boys was mostly mental and made things even more confusing than

usual. It wasn-""It was really strange seeing Draco come along without anyone noticing; especially

since everyone seemed quite happy watching Malfoy walk by himself next to the bed, but she couldn’t

help the way he sat up straight and looked at her. “You are so damn good.” ‘He―s not...‒ He trailed

off as she caught a glance from his mouth before he spoke again in a low tone that had Hermione‭

looking on edge with concern for him now of course; he was clearly trying very hard (and it was

getting closer and nearer every day) - ”- which is why you have no idea how long I have been here,

Granger! – Oh my gods, Draco – do you want me?‵ Granger‘mazing about all this shit, she thought

internally frantically while waiting patiently for Harry Potter's response when they arrived. She

knew what this would be like, seeing him angry and furious… well sorta, just kinder… more meaner.

But somehow she wasn't going out of character yet. Not without telling him exactly where she was

headed and then letting go when she realized there were other options. The fact left her feeling

distinctly disgruntled, perhaps even apprehensive. That didnÐt make much sense either since she‐d

seen Malfoy completely stomping down his bedroom door many times over the past few days to get

rid of some bloody mess or another girl, and he hadn¬t returned until nearly two hours later. No

wonder she never expected such an unexpected reaction to
