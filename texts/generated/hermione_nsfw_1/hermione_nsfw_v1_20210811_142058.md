'“Don’t you realize what we have done?” Hermione said, pacing up and down'

## Chapter 1

“Don’t you realize what we have done?” Hermione said, pacing up and down the corridor. Ron nodded

his head; it was rather a relief to see that she wasn't in any of them at all anymore – and he‘d

forgotten how utterly heartbroken her parents were by this point anyway! She looked back to him as

if with utter satisfaction… He saw why she wanted so badly for Ginny on such an emotional level–

more than anything else there really had been nothing wrong about their relationship yet they still

lived apart like ghosts together again?! But now?? ‒If I can―t stop loving you then who the hell can

do me one-on... or do everything to make sure my life is forever? Is Theo going anywhere, Hermione

Granger??? Draco sat on top of Bill's desk until everyone started giggling loudly upstairs towards

Harry Apparating directly into Gryffindor Tower. “Hermione Jean Parker has never told us much, but

she‬s a very bright girl even though most people donÑt know quite what exactly happened after that

blasted battle last summer when Voldemort attacked Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft And Wizardry

(sorry!), thanks mostly because Professor Dumbledore told everything and Hermione just wanted some

kind word from everybody. We—re not getting her out. Let alone being able explain what she did,–

Seamus sniggered cheekily whilst Molly Weasley kept insisting that Hermione should tell everyone

soon. She and Ginny had been having a big, happy time together in the kitchen at her flat, enjoying

the food they had eaten together over breakfast while she was on holiday with Ron; it felt like she

had finally found her voice again – and after spending most of the holidays in a foreign country

speaking French fluently for nearly three months… well not fluent enough to have said anything out

loud, but good enough anyway? They had spent much more time talking about their relationship than

just sharing love letters. Even so (she supposed) he hadn’t really spoken to her since then: even

though his mum seemed rather displeased by everything else going around him lately– when did all

this happen?? It had taken years from now until Harry realised that it would take them longer before

things would be right between them if one didn't move forward. He hated how often people were

judging the other based upon what happened last night. Maybe I ought back off my jealousy as best we

can, Harry thought bitterly. “You know what you want me too! You just donÕt get to say those words

every day either, do ya think?!” ‘I do!‒ he groaned inwardly into Fred's chest despite himself being

half asleep. The two men looked up at eachother and smiled wickedly. ********** Before anyone could

stop thinking about Ginny or Hermione deciding whether there would ever truly need another man-to...

A voice. It was hard to make out from the glassy blue of his vision as he blinked back a couple

moments before a shadow appeared in front of him, the same one who had been watching over Harry for

months now."What is it?" Sirius asked, turning on his heel and crossing the room towards his friends

with an evil grin.Harry shook his head as Lucius took note of them all then turned around and

disapparated after nearly twenty minutes. The door opened once more but no sound came forth until

soon that dark figure stood up behind Madam Pomfrey."Miss Granger," the Headmaster said quietly. He

turned slightly away when she looked at him and smiled brightly before returning her attention to

the others, "That's Professor Dumbledore. Come through here.""Good luck Mr. Potter," Dobby replied

cheerfully.Dobby nodded briefly while Remus headed off down into what could only be called some

sorta deserted castle grounds where they both heard voices coming near them. They were almost

certain this was Voldemort himself though since if nothing else, Bellatrix Lestrange also had a wand

aimed at his face making it quite possible that something like that was going on inside of the

school. Hopefully by tonight or tomorrow night however, neither of these witches would have any

chance at getting past Moody without having something much worse happen than being killed

outright.As anyone noticed Hermione snickering next to Narcissa, Lily moved closer to them. "So…

where is she?" James asked quietly. Lily nodded and kissed him softly before speaking. Hermione

glanced at James briefly, who nodded his head in agreement."She's here," he said with a slight smile

as they walked towards the portrait hole on the first floor of Hogwarts' castle. He was sitting on

it, watching Sirius take off from the lift into Grimmauld Place after their meal so that he could

spend some time with Hermione while they were still alone in Hogsmeade together during

lunchtime.Hermione frowned when Remus handed her an envelope which was addressed simply Severus

Snape and dated since November last year. She opened it eagerly and looked over it carefully until

she found what she had been looking for."You're writing me back? What are you doing this

evening?"Remus gave her a questioning look but only smiled weakly; staring down at the envelope

tightly, and then turning away again. He turned around and saw Mary kneeling beside him, smiling

brightly even though her eyes were darkening slightly."What do I need to write about this meeting?"

He asked, pulling out an unopened piece of parchment…"It seems my mother has decided against sending

me any correspondence regarding our relationship yet, Regulus!" Hermione said awkwardly.He

shrugged.Mary sighed sadly. "… Well, we haven't exactly talked much lately either -""I'm sure your

mum knows how important each other can be too", he

## Chapter 2

“Don’t you realize what we have done?” Hermione said, pacing up and down the length of her bed. ‘We

saved lives...and all we did was save our family! It doesn't matter if you were a Quidditch star or

not…you are nothing but an enemy to me. I am your friend now; I can take care that you stay away

from my scarlet witch forever.' She gave him another wave as she dropped onto Harry's lap once more

before standing on top his back with one hand raised above Ron in surrender for their continued

support despite being alone together since he had suffered through the attack. When it came time

again when Ron was under pressure again - even though there still wasnÕt a chance that he could find

a way out - they both moved forward and carried Ginny along while Neville held the other on either

side by George Weasley who ran over just long enough (but didn¬t get close enough) so that they

wouldn Ôknow which one would win this battle against Voldemort. Both Harry patted Ron on each

shoulder whilst Fred took his wand off his robes and walked past them, casting spells at anyone who

crossed his path yet again. They held hands until everyone realized where they stood, neither

wanting any part whatsoever between them anyway – although Draco seemed rather happy about having

found peace within them- allowing himself some space after his death on DagomirÓs orders. The twins

quickly retreated into themselves, leaving the room with a beaming smile on their faces as they did

so."You look great," Hermione said in a sing-song voice that had her squealing and giggling slightly

behind her ear at his playful words of encouragement even though she knew he was not talking to

her.He chuckled before turning to face her again when she closed the door behind them for him once

more but it was clear he didn't want anything else from this night either because after all he'd

been through over the past three months and already had learned many things about her too. Hermione

sighed inwardly and let out a sigh of relief while they all headed towards Hogwarts.The Gryffindors

were starting off slowly enough without too much trouble since only one of them could get inside

first thing today’s class by herself. It would be quite an experience indeed if Draco hadnÕt stopped

Ginny Weasley yet! She reckoned that just being around them might help keep her spirits up no matter

what. He wasn Òwell? To be honest I think it is rather fun to have someone hang out together whilst

you sleep or something. But we mustnÓt worry who gets there least anyway…As everyone turned back

outside however, Hermione felt Ron standing beside her opposite side and Hermione shuddered

involuntarily under how peaceful she looked compared wether they weren' right on top thereof amongst

other people's emotions clouded with nerves like some sorta haze. "I'm sorry, Hermione," he said

quietly and began to pull her up onto his lap, kissing her gently on the lips before moving over

towards their bedroom door."Just being around you for a little while is worth it.""Thanks." She

smiled back at him as she opened the door and stepped out into its narrow hall; everything seemed so

perfect in there. The darkness was not one of concern or worry though- as long ago Harry had been

known by many people within this house that they were all capable enough even if only for magical

beings who didn't know what time would be.She closed the distance between them and made her way down

the hall, stopping just short at Dumbledore's office."It's fine," Moody said as he took off running

after the boy. There wasn’t much else going on here except that Professor Vector had told him about

her visit once again.Hermione nearly jumped when she noticed Draco Malfoy smiling brightly behind

the desk. She thought it might have helped her get through her break from worrying but there was

something else too: she knew how his smile was meant...in her opinion anyway! She could tell because

he leaned forward slightly against the wall and gave an exaggerated grin to the headmaster."Oh dear

Merlin...""Yes sir? Do I need my glasses now?" Mad-Eye asked curiously looking over the four

students sitting in front waiting on each other.Moody nodded his head slowly."No, no, you don't know

that," Hermione said quietly and stared at him with a slight frown on her face as she took a seat in

the armchair opposite to Harry's bed where Moody was still sleeping, but he seemed quite tired now

because of all their recent events."Yeah, well I thought it would be nice to spend some time

together.""I'm sure we can get used both as soon-""We could try something different?""What do you

mean?" Moody asked pointedly eyeing Pansy closely while Harry snorted slightly before pulling back

from his pillow."Well first thing when someone else comes by your place? You're not doing anything

wrong like this is you?" Pritchardough shot up blankly then went quiet for another moment thinking

about what had just happened between them earlier."You should keep an eye on Ron over the weekend;

if there is any sign that Voldemort has been involved in anything whatsoever..." Harry chuckled

darkly ignoring Dobby who sat down next door looking suspiciously at his brother until Dookin popped

into view behind him smiling kindly towards the two men sitting near him."Dobby may have found out

already after everything they've done so far... right miss?" Daphne inquired anxiously poking

Diggle's shoulder lightly which caused Drouch Junior -"The poor boy doesn’t look very good today

though…" Harry shrugged sarcastically putting aside his mind trying hard to think things through

properly again

## Chapter 3

“Don’t you realize what we have done?” Hermione said, pacing up and down the length of his bed.  His

hand moved to pull her over so he could stand in front of them for a few moments before coming back

up again as if someone had used him…she heard Ron moan into their ear. ‘I won't let you be sorry for

what I did, Ronald Weasley! We were just trying not to hurt you. That was all part-of-it Harry got

from me! You saw how we talked about you when we first met, didnÕt your husband tell us that it wasn

Ðlovely or gross because those words were out there? DonÑt remind me she was wearing lipstick

tonight!  She wasn–well – but I still loved you with everything inside my chest; even with our

differences combined together." He paused, looking at one another intently now while staring right

at each other full on earnestness. "The thing is," Ginny began softly speaking between bites—a

little slow this time around considering they hadn¾t discussed their feelings yet--Hermione felt

suddenly uncomfortable thinking about this man who would never forgive himself for hurting others.

Even though being angry with him had been hard enough for her after her first year living here

during term break - she couldn  actually feel guilty about it. It seemed like such an easy choice

since she knew she shouldnnald anyone else then either George Carrow (who was now a Death Eater) or

Neville Longbottom. He wasn’t the only one who had lost his mind, and if not for the fact that he

was still alive even with his body in Azkaban, Harry would have been dead before him too. Not to

mention the way he could feel anything go wrong when they were alone together at Hogwarts. The war

hadn't gone so well over the last couple of years since Voldemort started to gain more power than

ever, which meant there were always some people around for him whenever he needed someone to comfort

them or whatever it might be like getting back from their ordeal. Even as Lucius Malfoy became a

tyrant-not just by being one himself but also because of how much Narcissa trusted her son in

everything she did with regards both sides regarding the Ministry during those years! Now though,

after watching Draco grow up into a man whose magic grew exponentially stronger every day, all

thoughts of killing Albus Dumbledore came rushing forth while I looked down on myself wondering what

my life should look like without having died once again…But here we are – actually living our lives

full time today? And yet despite this, Pansy doesnÕt know where exactly Hermione will end up next

year unless something goes wrong - right?! Yeah, maybe no bloody way is going out; perhaps Luna has

plans?? Maybe Ginny knows about me somehow? Oh damn... Her eyes flew open wide eyed briefly seeing

Blaise and Draco standing in the doorway. “Draco, are you alright?”Blaises eyes went to Theo, who

was rubbing his sweaty back soothingly as he looked at Draco. ‘Mm…’ Dracos head whipped around

looking confused but quickly calming down with a nod.‒I am fine, Blondie – I just need your help

getting them home. We haven't been able tell if they―re alive yet! They‥ve got some serious injuries

on their hands that have not healed properly; we can probably get one for sure later today. I know

this sounds like an impossible goal though- it just means that our healer can see them more clearly

and put their best judgement into all of these cases,‵ Hermione said sadly still glaring up at him

before she turned her attention over towards Harry Potter boy sitting on top from McGonagall making

light work out with Pansy Parkinson on behalf of Magical Law Enforcement. She could hear Weasley

start laughing slightly remembering how much fun that had felt when he had watched her make those

little tears vanish onto everyone else's faces by now or face even more agony than usual. It had all

been so much easier since being here during my school years alone, Ron thought sourly thinking about

how Ginny and Harry had treated him after having gone through similar torture together while trying

once before not breaking away from each other again.And finally, he was smiling at her. She’d let

him do this for years and he had been able to tell that she‘d changed the way they looked together

because of him—that maybe he could help change the world with his own brilliant ideas on how to

create better worlds—and it hadn't been easy to come back from all those hard years without falling

apart in a bad moment.He smiled at herself as he took another deep breath."That is brilliant," Harry

said quietly after a while (he had just finished their lunch), then turned to look at Hermione

hesitantly when she glanced down at them both before looking back up at Sirius who sat on one end

across what appeared like an armchair opposite Draco's desk where there were several stacks stacked

high against either side tables, the books scattered around in front along every surface imaginable

over breakfast ready-to see everything but a blank canvas, empty bottles filled out neatly atop

piles upon pile. "I think we should try something different.""Hmm?""Well... I mean, if you are going

through a certain kind or category of feelings..." He paused only slightly than intended; actually

surprised by this revelation of things between himself versus the others in general."You can even

use the word 'love' instead!"Hermione huffed and tried very hard to suppress some sort

response.Sirius rolled his eyes silently and simply continued reading till his mouth fell open and

the chair fell flat against
