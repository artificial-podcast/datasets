"I’m sorry," the woman said, and then the door closed behind her.The woman walked over to the bed, sat down on the bed, and shooed Harry off to the bathroom.

"Malfoy, what happened?" she asked."He was in the bathroom," Harry said, looking at his girlfriend.

"I haven’t seen him very well since last night."

"Why did you let him go?" Draco asked."Me," Harry shrugged.

"I didn’t want to leave him alone."

"Why didn’t you let him go?" Draco asked. a bit cocky," she asked.

"But I do not want him to be alone. I’ll teach him how to survive."

"I know," he said, looking at her carefully.

"But I’ll know if I can help him."

"I’ll be there for you," she said, looking down at the ground before looking up at him.

"Will you be my guardian?"

"I’m fine." He hesitated for a few moments, then said, "I’m just letting you go in peace. I’ll be there for you. you." Alex nodded. She nodded back."Okay," she said, "I’ll talk to you."Alex made her way to the stairs. Before the stairs could enter, she made sure to grab the messy towel she’d been carrying and slipped it into her hood. The curtains for the hearse were torn open, a large, silver raven with a flame-red raven engraving on it hung on the wall. Alex walked over to the raven, noticing the difference in the color. It was black. It looked like it had been taken from the forest, but Alex could tell the difference was due to the black panther on the head of the large gurney, he was told. He had not been able to take his eyes off of the raven, he supposed, but he was not moving at all. Tom leaned back against the wall in panic. His head snapped up onto the wall and he felt his magic drip from the tip and down the wall. He was able to catch his breath and he entered the room.

"What the fuck is happening?" he heard Tom call out.

"I can't understand. I can't believe this. What is happening?"

"I have no idea, but the ritual is alarming. It's like a weapon, like a weapon that can kill any other witch or wizard. In fact, in the current library of Hogwarts, the books about magical creatures are bound with the strongest magical defenses," explained Professor Balk.

"This will allow them to defend themselves, or their families, or even their friends. We've seen students dueling Dark Wizards and some of the students had been as strong as a ward against Dark Wizards. In the library, if a student is hit by a spell or a spell, they are sacrificed and find a place to live."

"That's the kind of spell you see coming from the library, Professor," said Professor Balk.

"Finally, the fifth year of Hogwarts, the girl I heard say that you're not supposed to go back to your room, I changed my mind," said Professor Balk.

"I shall see you at dinner. I hope you do well."Draco burst in, "What's wrong with you? What's wrong with your dad?"

"Are you mad at him?" said Draco.

"Is he having a bad day? Is he pushing you around or something?"

"It's not getting mad, Draco," said Professor Balk.

"He's just upset. He seems fine."

"And what's going on with him?" said Draco.

"He's not having a bad day? Is he angry?"

"He's not having a bad day, Draco," said Draco, "I don't think he's angry at you."

"I swear, I'm not having a bad day," said Draco.

"I just think I need to be careful."

"No one is going to hurt you," said Blaise.

"Yeah, I know it's not easy, I just want to get everyone to understand okay, we have the same rules as everyone else. We have the best of friends, we do everything together."

"I know, Blaise," said Blaise.

"I just don't want to hurt you, you are my best friend. You are my best friend now and you will never hurt me. You are my best friend again and you will always be mine. I can't do that to you, you are my friend and I love you. Draco, Blaise, I swear to you, we're going to do it." I shiver, and let my fists drop.

"I’m sorry," Draco whispers.

"I’m not going to start a fight with you, but I guess I’ll wait until I get what I want before I do something that’s dangerous." He holds my hands, keeping them tight around my middle.

"I’ll make it weird." He frowns.

"Don’t ever tell him I’m sorry."

"I know, I know," I admit.

"And I’m sorry that I am so mad at you." He smirks.  not like I’m going to let you kill me for it. I’m an Avenger, a hero, you know. If I was a prince, I would have killed my father, my family. I don’t want to kill you, Tom, but I’m not. I’m sorry if you are, but I don’t want to, I’m sorry if you are a disappointment and that’s the worst kind of disappointment." He bites his lip. I feel his arms relax me a bit.

"Tom, I’m sorry."

"No, no," he tries again, "I sorry for leaving you out of my life. But you’re a powerful witch, and you’re still my friend." I laugh, squeezing his hand.

"You’ve been through so much for me."

"I’m not trying to make you feel bad, I’m just saying that I’m sorry," he defends, as though I’m putting a damper on my mood.

"I’m just trying to be helpful. I’m not going to make you feel bad for not being here to help you." I nod.

"Just love you," I whisper.

"I’ glad you’re not scared of me, I knew I was the last person you’d want to be alone with."

"I am," he smiles.

"I’m always happy to have you, when you are in my presence," I convince myself, feeling a small sense of relief at his words.

"I promise, you’re not alone with me, either," he adds.

"You’re always welcome, that is."

"I miss you," I say, feeling a small surge of guilt.

"I know you don’t want to be with me, but I know if we are to be friends then I need to be able to look after her. If she is to be happy, then I need to look after her as well." He gave her a sad smile. He knew she had gone through a lot.

"I will, but there are a few things that I want to say," she said.

"I love you," he said as he laid her down on the bed.

"I just don’t know how to say anything else." She frowned and he gave her a look of apprehension before kissing her again.

"You are so beautiful," he whispered.

"I love you and I want you to know that I love you too, and it’s okay for you to have feelings for me when they are not there."A deep sigh rumbled through his chest and he realized that he’d just been trying to get a hold of the feeling of being touched by another. He leaned down to whisper, "I love you and I want you to know that I’m not just a little girl who can only be made in love." 

Steve was surprised when he heard the sound of a familiar voice against a nearby wall."Oh, and hey, we’re gonna have to talk about that later," he said, trying to avoid the question.

"Besides, I saw my mother."

"Tell him, I demand he—" Damian snapped, looking down at him.

"I’ll be fine."

"You can’t be serious." Traci said pointedly.

"You’re going to come back here and beat us all."

"No, I’m going to show my loyalty to my family. I’m getting my family killed, Trigon said." Damian said, sending the demon flying down while his mother and sister glared at him.

"Don’t be a coward. By coming here, we’re going to make it so you’re in danger," he said.

"And you’re going to have to lock yourself inside."Grimmauld Manor was not a horrible place for a few families, but it was a different story entirely when the two of them went through the castle gates and found themselves in a room with a single door. It was a small room, with a single fireplace and a single deep chamber with a single shelf of bookshelves. The main staircase to the top was open, and the door was closed just as before, leaving only a small amount of light on the door."Ah," Magnus said, "I’m afraid I’m not in the mood not in the mood, Magnus."

"You’re in the mood."

"Yes, you are."

"And you’re in the mood."

"And I’m in the mood."

"So you’re not ready?"

"Yes," Magnus said.

"I’d like to think that’s a good thing."Magnus didn’t believe for a minute that he was in the mood at all this talk."How do you know this is happening?"

"I do." Magnus said, in a breath too low for his tongue to cover, "The only thing you do is tell me everything."

"I know that, but I don’t need you to know everything, not when you have everything under your belt."

"You’re mad at me." Magnus said, "You’re mad at me."

"I’m not mad at you." Magnus said. He meant it, he held himself up high, and he didn’t need to know what was going to happen. Magnus had been right about the fact that Jace was the only one that could kill him, but he was angry at him not for his actions. He could barely even take a knife and finish the job. He was angry at Odin for letting him do that, he was angry at himself for everything, for letting his father and his mother go, for letting him be left alone. He had seen him with that mask and the disguise. He had seen his mother with that sword and his father with that sword and he had seen the way he looked at the world. That was the first thing he wanted to do. He wanted to let go of the mask and hurt the feelings he had for his father. He wanted to let go of all his memories and just let it go, let it go, let it go. He wanted to let go of his magic and let it go, let it go to his brain just like that. When the magic hit him, it knocked him out cold.He felt his skin and felt his teeth dig into the back of his neck, he let out a scream.When the magic hit him, his body began to move slower. He was only able to stay upright.The second spell the other students had cast aimed at him.The green-eyed let out a loud, deep sound and his skin turned white, he screamed on his own.He felt on the floor, the green-eyed stopped running and he fell to the floor, he fell to the floor and the green-eyed turned around. He reached to his neck, and the green-eyed turned his back on his knees. He knew they were both so nervous for the moment, but he tried to redirect his thoughts, not wanting to stir any suspicion from the others."Thank you," he said.

"I would’ve left, too." He looked around them, expecting the others, but when they didn’t, he made his way back to his house. He looked at his watch, which was quickly rising at twenty-eight, and it was only then he realized that his last hour was only a few minutes away. He wasn’t going to take the chances that he had with his friends now that he knew.He could feel the heat building up on his chest as he watched Lestat and David, and then with a small bow, he let Quinn’s hand go.

"Why don’t we have a chat?" He suggested to Gregory.

"It’s been a long time since I’ve talked to him in person, but I’ve been thinking about you."Gregory looked at Quinn for a moment, and then he looked at Lestat.

"Well, I’m glad to have you here on the balcony this evening, and I’m excited to show Lestat all your clothes." Gregory smiled.

"Lestat, I’m sorry I’m having to go back to my rooms. You are a little jealous," he said, and yet he did not look at him. It was a more than he had expected a surprise coming."Tell me then what you have done to make me feel jealous," Malfoy said.

"My father is a very proud man in my opinion. I’m way too proud of him. I don’t want you to know that."

"I don’t want you to know that," Harry said, feeling a little more embarrassed.

"I just want you to know that."Harry just looked at him in confusion, "You are the worst." He sighed.

"I don’t mean you to be mean, or to be mean, I mean it was just a competition. We all have a name for ourselves, but I don’t have the ability to call myself my Father, I mean I will always be the troublemaker, and I know we all do and we all do it without a heart."Alex nodded.

"Thanks."

"You are getting what you should be."Alex sighed and turned back to the couch.

"I don’t want to be the troublemaker."Elijah looked at her.

"You mean you don’t say anything about who is an exception?"Alex shook her head.

"I mean, I not really a fan of people who are completely out of line. I’m just a friend."Alex wanted to know what he was thinking.

"Why does that bother you?"

"Because you’re my friend."

"And I’m also your friend," said Alex, trying to make her point clear.

"And you have a point."

"Uh... ?" asked Alex. She was surprised to see that the words were actually not what Alex had been expecting."Yes," said Alex.

"And I have a point because I’m pretty sure my date is your date."

"Really? Harry admitted.

"It’s a different year. It’s colder." He looked at the landscape, which was a stark contrast to the pale blue of the lake.

"You’re not exactly in the same place as me, aren’t you?"

"Yeah," Harry said.

"I’m just...  I’m not in the same place as you. I’m not in the same house as you."

"That sounds like a terrible idea," Amelia said.

"I just want you to know that I am here for you. If you feel like dying I will kill you, but you will be mine. I am also here to take care of your parents, but your siblings are more important. If you still want to go for me you have a choice."

"No, I will not," Rora said, and put her hands on her knees, "I will stand up for you. I will not kill you."

Rora and Vanessa frowned.

"And I will not kill you, because you are my wife," Vanessa said.

"I will help you. I will help you."

Rora nodded and Vanessa made a face, "I’ll help you. I will help you."

"You are going to be okay." Rebekah urged, not wanting them to be so upset."I am." Vanessa said, "I’m going to help you. I promise."

"We will." Vanessa said, but said nothing else, and the room was silent for the next few hours. It was for the best that Rebekah decided to go back inside and sleep. She had a good feeling that she could do this, and the only thing that would stop her from doing it was when the sun had set.
