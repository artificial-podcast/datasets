"I don’t need to know about you," he told her as he heard her talk, "I just need to know what you want."

"I’m yours," she said, standing up and taking his hand in hers. She broke the kiss and looked at me, "I love you," she said.

"I love you more than anyone else." I looked at her, knowing what I wanted to say, but my heart was still in my chest.

"I love you too," I said softly.

"I’m more than the only one."She sighed, "I was never a married person I was just a kid in the family. I was a spoiled little child, like my dad."She said it with a sigh.

"I’m not going to say that now. I have a new boyfriend. I’m not even going to talk about the contract. I’ll just have to figure out my own way to get married."

"But you’ll never have a boyfriend unless you’re the first person to ever have a family. So no," said Draco, "I’m not going to argue that you should marry. I’m not going to argue that you should just go back to that party and have a boyfriend. 

"Oh," Bucky said, looking down at his watch.

"And talk to me about what I need." He grinned, and a hint of amusement crept into his voice as he looked at that expression.

"But before you go, I want you to talk to me about these important things."

"I’ll see you around," Steve said.

"And don’t get too excited about them. They’re not all for the little guy." He paused for a moment, wondering if he’d actually just pulled the strings in the first place.

"But I’ll go and talk to you."Viktor nodded, not exactly surprised.

"What’s going on, you little punk?" he asked, feeling the sting of his wrist again.

"You’re tight, you really are, you really are, and you’re not going anywhere."

"I mean...  Pasha’s been hiding it from me," Daniel said, shaking his head.

"I’m afraid she’s got some real issues here. I don’t want to risk her getting hurt." He looked up at Santh, and smiled softly to himself.

"She’s not going anywhere, but she’s probably going to have a few weeks to find you."

"I swear, I think that’s a good idea," Viktor said with a faint smile. He could tell that Santh was planning on bringing along a lot of the blood from the Originals and blood from exorcisms, but he’d also been thinking about how to use his exorcism skills to make a phone call to Santh, or what Santh was going to tell him when he was in the middle of a sex scandal.

"She’s a bit of a little girl, a lot of guys have been, and I’m not sure it’s going to help much. But it’s nice to have a competition for me."

"And we have less." Bucky said.

"And I don’t want to be a knight for you."

"Well, I don’t care if you’ve never been a knight. You have your heart. You have your power, and you’re going to be a good judge of that."

Steve said nothing, only turning to his laptop as he answered.

"I’m going to get it all processed."

Bucky nodded.

"Sounds good. And I’ll let you know if I have to go back."

 conversation between Lestat and QuinnLestat: Quinn, you’re going to Louis’s, and I’ll talk to him about this.Quinn: [Why are you so upset about Louis being dead? I don’t want you to have to live. I’m tired of being the only one that has your attention. You can’t just give up your whole life for Louis. You’ve been through enough shit to know that. I’m proud of you for doing the best you can for his happiness.Lestat: [I’m proud of you for doing the best you can for Louis’s happiness] /deleted Falls, VirginiaStill no answer. She just said to go to the office and ask about him, and then she would go to look for Louis and tell her what happened. And if she found him, then she would miss him.It was a good decision, if the man was still alive, at least it was worth it. She would never forgive him for that.

"Can you take this?" she questioned."Sure," he said, and he let himself be guided by her for the rest of the day. He hadn’t really wanted to be reading her books when she was reading to him, but she had mentioned that he was supposed to send her a letter, so he figured he should try again, but now he saw that he had his own plans."Then I’ll think about it," he said.

"I don’t know how to convince all the others to try to convince me. I don’t know how to convince my dad to give me a job. I don’t know how to convince the other to get involved in my own troubles."

"So you’ll come back to see the twins?"

"No, of course," Harry said.

"I’ll just ask the twins," he said, knowing how much he was going to regret getting even more out of the situation.

"But you can’t just let it happen. You know what happened with your dad."

"I know, and he was the one to hurt my mom and the other kids," Santh said.

"But that’s not a punishment for me. I’m not punishing you for anything. I have a job to do."

"And you’re doing it on purpose?" Armand asked.

"Well, you’re supposed to be on the side of the good people and not the bad ones. But what I am saying is that I am not punishing you. You’re wrong to do that. You’re being one of the worst assholes I’ve ever met. And it really wasn’t just you, Draco. You were an absolute disgrace to your own father and your family, and even if you could have been raised with that kind of freedom, that’s a tough thing to ever do. You’re just an asshole, not a good son."Draco was getting back into it with a sigh.

"I wish you would have gotten a better life. But alas, that’s not what you did. You’re an asshole." He looked away and looked at his Father again, who was looking at him with an equally annoyed expression."Father," Draco said "The only thing I can think to do is to see if this attack is truly causing any damage. I can’t let any of my family live in fear of you or your father, Father. As I said before, I am not a liar. And I want to try and get the truth out of your mind."For a long moment, the Slytherins in the Great Hall looked confused for a few moments, then Harry and Ron saw what they realized was Lissy and Trixy’s voice."Would it really be possible for her to escape?" Draco asked."An escape?" Harry asked, "What would have happened if there had been a chance? would have killed him," Draco answered.

"He would have been all over me."

"What?" Harry asked.

"How could you kill him?"

"I could have," Draco said.

"I would have killed him."

"You’re so angry," Harry said.

"I’m so sorry, I should have killed him."

"So what would have happened?" Draco asked."The Dark Lord would have killed him."

"Why would I kill you?" Harry asked."Because we need a plan," Draco said.  We need a plan. We don’t need a plan for all of this, or for others, or for your parents. I want to help you in all ways. I know you’re exhausted mentally and emotionally, but I’ll make you take the best possible care from the closest available student."Harry nodded. He was in no better position to help, and he moved his wand to the floor, and Harry sank into the bed. He was up for the next few minutes, and once his head was properly rested, he sat down. He waited for Professor Balk to finish speaking, when he said "Yes," and quickly moved to sit down next to him.

"What is it that you want to do and why are you doing it?"Constance looked up at him, "I don’t know what you want to do, but I think I know. I don’t know what this spell is, but I want you to do it."

"Why?" he asked, his eyes full of concern."You want me to do something to get you out of the woods?"

"You want me to make you do something to get me out of the woods?"

"If you want to, I will. It is in your nature, isn’t it? I am not going to do anything to get you out of the woods get you started on that," Klaus said.

"Come on." He turned back to the door.

"I have to go to the garage. You’ll have to wait a little while." He smiled at Klaus. He was relieved that he had a ride with the boys. They were all eager to get into a car and drive. It was like they had a family vacation. They woke up to a loud crash, the sound crackling in the house, and the sound stopped. Klaus and Elijah saw that the front door was off. They looked around frantically. Klaus opened the front door, but there was no one. Slade was not there. It was just the wolves and the wolves, the wolves. He took out his wand and lifted the wolf from his body and spun him to face Slade. He looked at the other wolves, taking them into his arms. He walked to the door and opened it quickly. It was locked. The door opened and the two wolves turned to the other. They all turned to him, and he raised his hand towards them. The wolves all did the same, turning to him.

"You are going to have to get out of here. Do it," the wolf said.

"But I am going to kill you. I will kill you," the witch said.

"No, no you'll never. You are no witch, you will never be a witch, you will never kill me."

"It is true, my dear. You will never be a witch, you will never be a witch, you will never be a witch. I would be happy for you if you were more powerful. But I am going to kill you before you fall apart like that," the witch said.

"I'm going to kill you before you fall apart like that. Don't tell anyone about it. I'm sure I've already killed you before. You're just a witch. I'm sure you will do the same." Harry felt the cold on his body and he felt his face flush. He didn't want to die if he couldn't. He was in pain. He just needed to make up for it through sacrifice."I’m not going to be killed," Gregory said.

"I’m not going to be killed either."Armand nodded.

"You don’t have to kill me." He glared at him.

"I would rather die than die for my wife." He could tell he was being a dick. To put it plainly, he was.

"I would rather kill her than end you ever having to live with her. She was my only choice, you know. Not because of you, but because she was your only choice, and I wanted her to know you were hers. And I know you have feelings for me as well. And I love you for it."

"I’m not jealous," Luna smiled, but she didn’t know what to say. She only knew that her husband had been so vocal about his feelings for her. Her husband had been so close, so honest, and she was devastated.

"I love you too, Luna," Theo said.

"Can we sit around a bit and talk about what happened last night?"

Luna sighed.

"I’ll be up soon," she agreed, at the same time she stood up.

L stepped in and grabbed a handkerchief from the pocket of her robes, she nearly threw it, but was stopped as she watched her sisters entered the room. They were both very young and the only ones that could come up to Emmeline were the twins and Lee. Emmeline and Leevanna were standing back in the entrance hall, and Lhu and Theodore were in the same place.The twins were all showing off their collections of rare books such as the Golden Boy and the History of Magic book from the History of Magic. The twins were showing off their collection of silver charms which had an extremely strong effect on the human eye. Fred and George were also showing off their collections of rare books which had an extremely strong effect on his mind.

"That is where I get my magic," he said as he listened to the voices of the people talking.

"I get my magic from the books of the Dark Lord and it is the only one that I know of to help me in such a difficult place."

"How would you describe the magic of the Dark Lord?" Harry asked, trying to keep his voice low, "How would you describe the Dark Lord?"

"The Lord of the Rings," Voldemort said, "is one of the most powerful wizards of all. The Dark Lord has a power far beyond anything I have ever seen in a wizard. He is nothing more than a fuckinable little fuck and I am disgusted with himself. He is just a fucking monster and I would never do anything to him. I don’t want him to feel guilty about anything," I scowled at her.

"I have nothing against anyone, I just think they are all just monsters." She looked my way and shrugged, "But I don’t want to have this, I want to feel more at peace with myself."

"What?" I asked, not believing her."You are just a fucking monster," she said, her voice heavy.

"You are a fucking monster, just like you were before." I’m not," Tom sighed. He wanted to turn and kiss Harry, but he didn’t have the strength. He didn’t want to lose Harry. He wanted to kiss, but he had no self control.

"So, what can I do for you?"

"I’m not terrible," Tom said.

"But I don’t want to be disrespectful, not on you. If you want to be, I’m not going to make you leave me."

"Why don’t you—"

"I’m so sorry," Tom cut him off.

"I don have the heart for that. But I think you’re right," he said.

"It’s just...  you’re... "

"I am sorry," Harry said.

"But you’re right. It’s just a little bit of you."

"I’m right," Tom said.

"And I am perfectly happy to keep you safe."

"But I’m not the only one," Harry said.

"I think you’re only trying to protect me from my friends, Tom, and not just anyone who might try to harm you."

"I not on your side," Harry said.

"I’m just trying to help you."

"This is the second time he’s been this kind," Ron said.

"He’s been this kind to me. He’s never been this kind to anyone."

"That’s why we have to keep in mind that Harry Potter is your friend!" Harry yelled, "I’m not just a friend. I’m a friend to Tom, Tom."

"You’re not a friend, Tom," Harry said.

"I’m just trying to help you.
