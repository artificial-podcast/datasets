"I know," she said, and then the pain was gone.

"I’m just glad you’re safe."

"Well, I’m going to be visiting some of the other witches that were cursed by the Council to prevent them from being caught. They’re just going to have to deal with that first."

"And we’ll be seeing more witches like you," Hermione said.

"I’m glad to hear that."As soon as the other two women went back into the kitchen, Harry left the living room, and he and Ron went over to the others’ quarters. There was a group sitting down in the living room, the entire group staring at each other in confusion."What is it?" Bucky asked."The Prince is your father," Steve explained.

"Hannah, the blonde," he said.

"We’re your cousin, too. I mean, I was the one who suggested you two get married."

"I know," Bucky said, "but I was the one who suggested we get married. And I think you two need to talk about it."

"Not talking about it, because it’s really not your fault," Steve said."It wasn’t your fault," Steve said.

"I get the feeling that you’re never going to look out for me here. And it’s not your fault that you’re always going to be haunted by me."

"It’s just that I’m the most handsome person you’d ever met in your life," Bucky said.

"And I’m not going to hold you back, even when I’m trying to keep you safe. Not when it’s good for you."

"Of course it’s good for you," Steve said. He looked at Steve’s face and knew he was probably being used.  not going to throw a fit about it, and I don’t even know what to say about the Serum. I’m just saying that I’m getting my ass handed to me. But I’m going to have to find a way to say no. I’m just not going to try and cause trouble." He laughed, looking back up at him, and then he held out his hands and the two of them walked away.Steve sighed. He’d been going to bed for a while, but he’d been feeling a little anxious lately. He’d been thinking about getting out of the house today when he got there and felt the door close shut."Are you really going to kill him?" Draco said."I don’t know," Blaise said.

"He’s one of the only Death Eater people you’ve ever killed."

"I can’t kill him," Draco said.

"I won’t. You can’t let him die. You can kill him. But he’s the only one who can save my life." Blaise pouted before looking at Draco with a hint of anger. He hated that word so much."I’ll kill him," Blaise said.

"I kill him too, or die of the curse from my mother."

"I hate that word," Draco sighed.

"I’m going to get my wand out."

"Go ahead, Blaise, but I need some help," Draco said, pulling out his wand. He was already halfway to his old bedroom. He didn’t want this conversation to end badly for Lissy and Trixy. He would go to their parents and get them some help. He could take care of all the girls and his aunt. He also had a partner. He could help Professor Balk get some help. This was a dangerous game, and he would have to go to the moon or something to prove his point. He was tired of it and the fact that he had to give a signal to the other side to get him away from the actual fighting."So, where do we go then, Mr. Potter?" Harry asked.

"I’ll have to face the consequences of what I did."The blond sighed and looked down at his hands.

"You look like you’re just a mess." He gave Harry a small smile.

"I think I’ll go."

"Right," Harry shrugged.

"I think I’ll go. We’ll get going then, Harry."Harry took a deep breath and pulled himself out of the Great Hall. He walked towards the Gryffindor Table, where Professor Balk had begun pulling Harry out to the Great Hall to be able to talk to him.

"I’ll figure something out," he said.

"I think it’s my moment," he said.

"I’ll do it."

"I’ll," Harry nodded. He’d just been hoping for a good conversation with Professor Balk. It didn’t work, he realized. He just had to focus on the Gryffindor table, and it was just the two of them.Harry looked up at Professor Balk, his eyes on the Gryffindor Table. Harry didn’t know what to say but he wasn’t about to do anything."Aren’t you going to have to wait until we have a meeting?" Professor Balk said with a sly smile.

"You know, I’m not sure I really want to see you two in this house."

"You’re just mad at me for this!" Harry exclaimed.

"I’m so mad at you. I’ll stick to my ways, and keep my temper up."

"I’ll keep my temper up!" Professor Balk looked at him with a smirk "You’re being a little careless."

"I am," Professor Balk said, "Though I do hope you understand that."

"Very well, Professor Balk," Professor Balk said, "I will see you both the next time I’m in town."

"Go and find your relatives," Professor Balk said.

"I’ll bring you to the library."

"Once I’ve found my family," Professor Balk said.

"There is no reason to be careless."

"Before I go, I want you to set your clothes on fire and stand outside as close as you can without getting caught."

"I’ll be right back." He tore his eyes away from the fire. He felt like he was being watched. And he felt a twinge of guilt. He was being watched, and it was not because of the things that happened between them. It was because he was not being watched. This was going to be his punishment. The last thing anyone wanted was to be watched.Harry thought about it for a long while. He held on to the dress he had gotten himself in from the wardrobe, and he started unbuttoning it. He quickly tugged it to reveal a black shirt, and he opened it up to see a dark red dress shirt."Your robes are a sight to see. I’ll need to tell them to change," Lissy said.

"You’re in trouble for not telling them the truth."

"I’ll be right here," I told her.

"I promise."

"Good," Lissy said, coming over to the dresser and putting a large charm over her robes.

"You should know, I have been making a lot of noise with my arse, but not with you."

"And you’re not doing it to stop me from doing it," I said softly.

"I’m just saying that you are getting better and I want you to know that."

"I don’t want you to know that. I want you to know that."I brushed off his hair and turned to him.

"You have my word," I said.

"If you want to learn what I’m saying, you have my word."I rolled my eyes. I wasn’t supposed to say anything, but I had to.

"I’m sorry," I said.

"I swear to you, I’ll never hurt you."

"I’ll never hurt you."

"I’ll never do that at all," he said.

"And you can’t call me by my name, I’ll be called by my mother." He looked away.

"I’ll never kill you, I’ll never kill you."

"You never said that. You’ll never kill me," Harry said.

"I just asked."

"You have to," Ron said, and Harry wished he could be just as sure.

"I’ll never kill you, you have to. Just tell me what you want, and I’ll do it."

"Harry, I’m so sorry," Ron said.  I whispered."I’m sorry," Harry said.

"I’m sorry, too, Ron. You know I’m angry at you for. I’m angry at you for worrying about me. I’m not angry at you for being in that situation, I’m angry at you for leaving again. What am I supposed to do? Go back to my room? Dinner with you? Not in my room. You know I’d rather have spent time with you and have someone with you, too. I’m angry at you for not being there for me. I’m angry at you for hurting me. I’ sorry, I love you. I love you deeply, and I can see you in the mirror over the last years."I love you." He looked to Quinn for a moment, looking back at him and then looking back at the window, sitting up and moving to stand on his own feet.

"I love you. I love you."Quinn smiled at him, and looked at the window for a moment, and then looked back at the window again.

"I love you. I love you. I love you. I’ll never hurt you," he said with a smile. He knew he was still pissed off at Daniel for the last time, but he didn’t try to upset him with his actions. He was more concerned with Daniel’s reaction to him on the train.Daniel sighed.

"I’ll be fine," he said, his shirt half-covered.

"I’m not angry with you, Armand. I was just upset."

"Well, I’m sure you’d be more upset if it were you who fought us," Armand said with a knowing smile.

"You’re not the only one who’s been through bloody it." He gestured to Daniel, who seemed to be sitting there with a sigh. He could see how he was feeling, and he figured it would be best to just let him be alone in that room for the rest of the day.

Peter sits on the bed and is reading a book, he tries to get out a bit and just relax a bit. Elias comes and sits down next to him. 

"Hello, I'm glad you are back." He is not sure what he would say if he found out he was a spy.

"I am well my friend. I am a bit of a bit of a fickle thing. Elias, I think you can understand that" He sees a small smile on his face and he finds him very easy to handle.

"I am aware, don't worry. I’ll let you two go back to bed." Harry held the book he was reading next to him, "Not one more time, Harry."

"How do we know you’re not done with your homework?" Ron asked."I am," Harry said.

"I have given my wand, but it’s not ready yet."

"I’ll see what I can do," Harry said, looking the book as he read.

"I don’t want to do it on my own."

"I shouldn’t be surprised about that," Ron said."I’ll always accept your authority," Harry said, looking at his robes.

"I’ll never be surprised about it."

"I also don’t think you have the faintest idea of what you’re supposed to say," Ron said, looking away.

"Are you ready to tell the others?"

"Yeah," Harry said quickly.

"Why don’t you just tell them?"

"I’m not afraid of them," Ron said.

"I am afraid of my own, just like you."Harry nodded, feeling a little more comfortable with his conversation. He had to ask Tom, per the way if he thought he would like to ask him to dance at his party rather than wait for him to finish. 

He had to ask, 

Tom stood up to leave, before he could even think of anything else to say. His coat was covered in blood, as if to show they had been poisoned, and he stood there in the sunlight, his hair damp, looking at the stars behind him. He had a sneaking suspicion that if he wanted to look with his old friends, it would be nice to make the least noise...

He had to turn around and take a few steps back.

The doors opened with silence, and he stumbled back, the air was thick and the air was hot - or at least, it was hot enough to make a fire or a knife look like it was meant for a fire, but hot enough to leave you breathless."Well, never heard you say that again," he said, sitting back still, his eyes on the fire in the center of the fire, watching as it grew brighter. People to the left of him, the flames started to move against the fire and some of them started to get sickened, they stopped, and turned to watch as the flames moved again, this time into a sickening sort of shriek, and the sounds of it grew louder.

"You said, you mean!"The second fire started to move again, this time it was the nastiest one. I leaped to my feet, shooting my wand at the fire and trying to get it to let the light escape. It was a fairly easy thing to do, but I got caught by one of the flames as it made a row of flames.

"I’m sorry!" I cried.

"I’m so sorry!" I struggled to get out of the flames, but it was too late. My eyes widened as the flames did just that."You’re so sorry!" Draco mumbled.

"You’re a terrible father!"

"You’ll never forgive me, Draco," I said.

" just a pretty pretty girl, you know."I smiled.

"Thanks. I’ll be better for it, though."

"I can’t wait to teach you," he chuckled.

"You’re so much fun to watch, and I’m not sure I’m going to be mad at you for it."

"But my father will protect my dad," I said."And I will be the one that tracks you down," he said.

"I’ll be the one that starts this war."

"You’re the one that starts this war," he said.

"You’re the one who is going to give us what we need, and then we’ll have to fight each other."Well, that was a good idea, that’s what he said, and it seemed to kick off again. The two of them were fighting at an extremely high intensity."You’re the one that’s going to win this war," Harry said.

"And then we’ll have to fight each other."

"I’m the one that’s gonna win this war," Ron said.

"And then we’ll have to fight each other."Harry stomach started going, and he was about to say something else when the door opened again and a long-haired woman walked in, very much a familiar face, and she said, "Ronald, Ronald! I remember you, Ronald, Ronald!"

"I remember you, Ronald, Ronald, Ronald!" the woman said sharply, her voice sounding much more calm than Harry had ever heard it.

"We have to go!"

"Of course we will," Harry said.

"We’ll find you the others just as we do now."

"No, I don’t want to be found," the woman said, and she took the man hand and pulled him towards them.

"Let’s go to the quarry and find him, then."She gave him a stern look and the boy nodded his head.

"I’ll ask him to show you some food."

"I’m sure he will," she said.

"He has a pretty good appetite, but he’s still a little stiff and cold."

"Good," he agreed, and nodded.

"I can tell you which way to go."They rode through the night sky, the wind whipping them from side to side. It was a rare sight, and the moon was shining brightly against the sky, but the moments were fleeting. They were spent in silence, hot and heated as they watched the stars, and they had no choice but to follow their heart.

The vibrations of the wind were, however, making their way up the mountain, and they were in a momentary state of undistractedness. The figures inside the walls were all pushed back, almost to the floor, and the rocks and leaves that had been footing the earth and made the walls reflect were scattered all over the floor.

The moment the ball began to move, after a brief moment, they all gathered in a circle around it, and with the help of the wind the two continued to descend.
