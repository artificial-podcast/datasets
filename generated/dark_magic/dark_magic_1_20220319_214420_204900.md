"I’m sorry," she said softly, looking at him tiredly.

"I have some good news to tell you, anyways."

He looked at her, looking and looking.

"I’m surprised that you know what you’re supposed to do with me," he said, feeling a little irritable."I’m not," she said, "I’m too busy with my usual duties to actually talk to you like that," she looked at him bitterly.

"If there’s a thing with him, it’s that he’s not in a good mood, but then he in a better mood.

"I’m sorry," he murmurs, and he doesn’t let go of the blade. He feels the heat spreading through his body, and he tries to take it from Peter, but he has to accept that he’s not hurt.

"Tom?" He asks again, his voice quiet and firm.

"Yeah,"

He tries to ignore the pressure in his chest and keep his hands on his body, but he doesn’t want to be hit so hard that it hurts.

"I’ll go eat with you, I’ll go see some of our friends," Lestat said with a tired smile as he followed Lestat to the door. He knew he’d have to step in and take a break, but he decided she needed him. He found a chair in the living room and sat down.

"I’m sorry for all the fuss. I just need to focus on my business and not be so flustered."Lestat let Quinn lead him to his bedroom, and he felt a little more comfortable in it. He wanted to be alone with Quinn, and he’d also been wishing he could take care of family matters, but it seemed Lestat was more focused on his job than his company."I’ll be fine," Lestat said with a little too much confidence.

"Lestat. I’m sure he will be fine."

"And I’ll be fine," he said with a little more confidence.

"It’s just that you have been acting like a vampiric all these years, and the blood you’ve taken from your wife is a miracle from your mother, perhaps an even bigger miracle than any other I have ever seen."He gave Lestat a tight bow and told him to leave."I will," Lestat said softly. He didn’t want to let anything go.

"I will be leaving soon." He did not reveal his intention to Louis, but Lestat had already been thinking about what Viktor had said about Viktor wanting to stay for a while.

"I will go speak with the other here."Louis nodded.

"What is it?" He sounded a little unsure, but Louis needed to know.

"Armand and I have been busy."Louis shook his head.

"I think I have a pretty good idea that Armand and Daniel will be back in the next few days. I hope that Daniel is okay with staying for a few more days. But you know Louis, if they come back they are going to need more time."

"He heh," I said, trying to think.

"He’s not my favourite person either, by the way."

"I am the one who is," he said, and he pulled me in for a hug."You are the only person in this room that I know can get me through a lot of stuff. I’m not supposed to get anything done. You can’t beat me," I said, wondering about that.

"If you don’t want me to help you, you can’t."

"I’ll help you," he said, and he pulled me by my hips.  too, and I, you know? I really like you. I just need some time to figure out why you two are so close." I didn’t realize that I was being so bold, but I was all over the place. I’d only felt the edge of a kiss to the head, and my body reacted to it. The moment he pulled away, his body relaxed and he slowly stirred with his breath.

"You don’t need to be aware of the reality of it," he said, holding me up by my hips. I watched as he turned around and looked at me.

"Your pretty face." His eyes seemed to stare at me for a long time, but I told him that I had a pretty face.

"I’m better."

"I know."

"I’m so sorry," I said to him.

"I’ll just take care of it if you need that."

"I’ll see you around." He nodded and walked away. We followed him and he gave me a kiss on the cheek, "You’re a good friend," he said to the rest of our friends."You’re amazing!" Pansy grinned.

"You’re so kind." I smiled at her.

"We should get Viktor out of Rolf’s room so we can all have fun."Pansy looked at me.

"Oh yeah, I’ll be there and watch him do that as well."

"That’s a good plan," I said, stretching my legs to get them up.

"I’m excited for his next move." I looked at her.

"I’m sure he knows he’s going to enjoy it."

"You’re so cute," Pansy said, with a smile.

"You like his hair!"

"Oh, I like his hair said Ron."You’re always so pretty," Hermione said.

"I’m always so pretty."Hermione was only interrupted by the squeals of the boys.

"It’s just a game," she said, "I’ll have you know that!"

"You know that," said Harry, "Susan and Ginny are too," he added.

"I’m sure they’re all very interested in you."Hermione did not move her hand.

"We’ll have to get back to Hogwarts."Harry saw Hermione’s face. He did not want to argue with her. He would have just talked to Ron, but he had no idea if she would be ready to discuss anything personal with him.

"Now, Hermione," Ron said, "I think you’re drifting off, aren’t you?"

Hermione was already whispering in her mind, and Harry’s right was even more obvious than ever.

"I thought I said I was not in trouble."

"Well that’s good," Harry said.

"I’ll try to keep you in the loop."

"I will not," Hermione said.

"You are an idiot and I am useless."Auburn pouted.

"You are a spectacular liar, and I am a terrible liar."

"So you are supposed to be an idiot," Harry said.

"And I am a terrible liar too."

"You’re an idiot," Hermione said.

"You are an even more horrible liar than you are a terrible liar."

"I don’t know about you, but I’m always cruel," Harry said.

"I don’t like it when you’re a terrible liar."

"I know," Hermione said.

"I a terrible liar, and you’re a terrible liar, and it was my fault for being so angry at David times ago."

"You’re not a terrible liar, Hermione. You almost got yourself killed by it."

"I get that I’m a terrible liar," Hermione said.

"And you’re a bad liar, even if you don’t think I’m a bad liar."

"Are you sure?" Neville asked.Hermione looked at her briefly.

"I’m sure."

"I’ll be there."

"I’m sure, Neville said as he turned to the door, and he stepped inside. He didn’t consider that Hermione would be there. He wondered if she would be able to see him.

"Have you heard from Professor Flitwick?"

"You’re getting a lot closer," Harry said, looking around. He frowned, and opened Professor Flitwick’s office door.

"He’s not here."

"I mean," Professor Flitwick said, "We talked about that before."

"Right," Professor Flitwick said.

"I’m sure if it’s you, Professor Flitwick can handle you."

"I’m not scared of you." Harry said.

"I’m scared of you."

"Just worry about me."

"I don’t want to get wasted," Harry said.

"I am not trying to kill you. I want to protect you. I want you to be safe. I want you to be happy. I want to keep you safe."

"That’s how I know you are," Blaise said.

"I will protect you both."Harry and Draco had been fighting for a bit, but they were not going to be your parents. They had the right to keep you and your mother."

"... I’m sorry," she said.

"I need to find you something."Daniel tried to keep his voice level, his voice hoarse even while the heavy weight of his chest hung heavy on his head.

"I need to find you something, I can’t... I know you don’t understand, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry," he said as if afraid he would say something stupid.

"I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I’m not sure what you need to help me find you... but I think I have some company then, I need you to be strong for me."

"Of course!" Yoongi smiled as he got up, a bit disappointed that there was no one there, "I’m a little... a little mad that I can’t be here to see you."

"That’s okay, my love, you can be there for me. I promise." Yoongi kissed the side of Yoongi’s head before turning back to the seat where his father was sitting.

"I love you too, my friend."

Yoongi turned to the young man, "And I love you, my king. nodded, nodding at his wife.

"I am happy, my king," he said.Seyton crossed his arms, "Thank you, my king."

"You are welcome to come with me to this hut, my lord." He bowed to his mate and disappeared back into the council chamber, the two of them ignoring the half of the citizens who were waiting in the kitchen. Yoongi went to the small wooden shack in the center of the village, "I’m sorry, I am sure it’s only a little bit longer than that." He said softly, he looked around for his white kimono, " show you the window seat, you’ll have to wait until I’m done."Hoseok’s expression grew cold, he suddenly thought he wasn’t a good enough person to even have his own room. So he took a breath and made his way to the door where Yoongi stood.

"It’s just a part of the plan," he said, "I’m going to show you."

"You plan on going to the palace?" Yoongi asked, his voice growing slightly quieter, "What are you going to do?"

"I’m going to stay with my father Harry said.

"I’ll have to ask what the hell are you going to do, Crabbe is just finishing his shift and he’s making me give him a break, and I’ll have to do the same with my mum."

"Okay," Draco said.

"You’re just being a dick," he muttered.

"And you’re doing the same with Harry and me."

"I’m not doing anything," Harry said.

"You’re doing the same with me and your mother."

"I’ll have to ask... " Draco shook his head.

"I wouldn’t mind a little bit of...  some blood."

"I wouldn’t mind," Harry said. He looked at his mentor once more, "I mean, it’s not like we’ve ever been close...  however, it’s not like I’m the one who started it, so I’ll be careful, I’ll be careful, and I’ll see if I can help it."Harry felt his head drop, and he frowned. It was just his imagination, like any imagination. He was always so distracted, and his mind was playing around with his memories, which grew even more over-the- with every memory.

"You were a witch, and you were a monster. But you were also a monster, and a monster was always a monster. You were a hero. And you were a hero, and a hero was a monster."That made him freeze, as soon as his paws landed on the bed and he carefully patted it, he felt a warm sensation in his chest as his legs gave out, he was very aware that his whole body is moving slowly, but the feeling was still present. He had a feeling that he is falling asleep, and his hands were shaking."I’m going to bed," he whispered.

"Enjoy your night."

"I know you’re awake," Harry said.

"Just a little bit more, and then you’ll have a good rest."

"Hear me, Draco," Harry said.

"Sleep well."

"I’m Harry," Draco said.

"I have to be careful."They were all silent for a moment and Draco said to Harry, "I know it’ll be hard for you to get in, but you’re going to get through this. Sleep well."Harry put a hand on his wand and said, "Goodnight, Draco."

"Goodnight, Draco."They both left the room and went to bed. A few minutes later, Harry and Ron woke up in a different room. They were in bed, one bed, and Harry had to turn around to see that Ron was sleeping soundly. Ron’s hand stilled on Harry’s wand and he started to slowly pull Harry’s other arm.Harry’s hand was still in his pocket, and he was breathing slowly, feeling as though he were trying to be awake. He felt a warm body against him. His eyes still focused on Ron’s hand, trying to catch the feel of his hand against his skin."Harry," Ron said softly, "You’re awake." Harry looked down at him, "I’m not going to do that," Ron said, "I’m sorry. They’re going to have to be real warriors to them."

"Oh," Harry said, "You’re right, I’m just sorry. It may be a while."

"I’m not sorry, that is my fault," Ron said.

"We just need some time."He looked at Harry again, "I’m sorry for not being there last night, but you’ll have to get over it. And, I’ be sure to look after you as you have been through." 

"And how do you feel, my darling?" Damian asked, nodding at the witch. 

"I feel... I feel safe around you-"

Damian took out his wand, looking for a wand that could knock him out easily.

He was not going to let his fear of death overwhelm him.

He only had to wait a few moments until he was able to achieve his goal of killing all of her.

Chapter 27The Dragon’s BathroomKlaus was a curious sight. He was dressed in a white button-up shirt, black jeans, and a dark green polo shirt.

"What’s wrong," he said with a wry smile.

"You look awful," he said.

"I hate you." He took the box of tissues from the drawers and wiped the neatly packed package down the stonework. He’d never really encountered a disease as bad as Argo. It was just the way the way it had spread through his life, how quickly it could spread so fast that it could kill. But it was Argo, and now, he was suffering from that sickness, the symptoms spread like a plague.

"There are a lot of pharmaceuticals that can help," he said calmly as they walked behind the building.

"And I’m sure you already have your own pharmaceutical company," he added.I nodded."And I’m sure you already have a pharmaceutical company?"

"Yes," I said without thinking.

"We have a lot of things we can help you with, but we want you to have a place of your own, trust me."

"I’m the one who owns the shelves in the library," he said, looking at me curiously.

"I’ll be back before dawn. I’ll go to the library, see what’s in the shelves, and then we’ll go to the library." 

"If you’re so worried about me, you wouldn’t be so worried about me. I have enough staff."

"I’ll never tell you that," I say, still feeling awkward.

"And I have enough staff. I’ll always be in charge, and I’ll never make you jump on you or hold you back," I tell him. 

He looks down at the books in front of him.

"I have enough staff. I’ll never tell you that. I have enough staff.
