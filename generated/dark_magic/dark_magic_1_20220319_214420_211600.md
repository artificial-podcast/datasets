It feels as though he is hallucinating, as though something is happening and he has to breath to make himself stop. It is so cold. He has to stay in his room for a little bit longer and then he will be able to get out of bed and get away if he wants. In the meantime, he should just tell Chrysanthe and Lestat the truth and move on.What would he do without the cold? He is warming the castle and everything will feel warm. He hopes so too. He will be safe with Chrysanthe in his room. He doesn't want to be alone... but he is becoming more and more convinced that it is just a bad idea to be alone in this room. If it is alright I’ll just take it out of your mouth." He said this not wanting to sound like he was trying to be mean, but he didn’t want to.Harry’s expression was one of guarded and guarded shock.

"You mean like, you’re angry?" he asked instead, trying to envision the moment between them next."Yeah, I’m angry. Maybe I’m just not sure what kind of anger is to be expected," he said, finally tolerating the image.

"I’m sorry, but you have to be careful, Harry. You are not one for arguing, which is funny because I’m not is this with you?" I asked, frowning slightly at him.

"You look like you need someone to make you look better, but you’re no one."

"How could you be so... ?" he sneered."I’m just teasing," I replied, "I don’t need to be."

"You don’t have to be." He began, but I just said, "I like you, but you can be so much more than the other."

"You know, I’m a good person," I said, feeling a little embarrassed "And I’m not stupid. I know you’re right."

"And I’m not stupid," he said, looking back at the sea in his hands.

"I’m just... I don’t know."

"That’s not why you told me to come to you," I said.

"This is why you told me not to talk about the Dark Lord. I told you that I knew you, and that was the reason I came to you."

"That you’re not a witch," I said, raising my eyebrows.

"I know that what you are saying is often a little bit of a lie, but the fact of the matter is that I’ve caught myself a few times over the last couple of months. The truth is that you’re a very good player."

"I don’t need you to be perfect," I said.

"I just need you."

"I promise," he said.

"I promise that I’ll watch you work."

I sighed, knowing he was right, but I know he didn’t want to push through my love for him. I could read that in his mind.

"I don’t care what you think she yelled angrily."Oh, I’ll figure it out!" he said, coming to a stand next to her.

"I don’t mind!"She leaned forward, her hands on her hips, giving him a fierce squeeze.It was not a simple matter, it was an act of intense control. He felt her shift his cock and turn him on her, her hands on his hips, pulling him inside. He was careful to keep her in the bed, her hands on his bare skin, and he did not want to give into her, so he let her go."And how did you do that?" he murmured, not wanting to let her go can say that for me, if you like, but I don’t mean that. I’ll just have to try to do the same with Chrys and everyone else," she sighed.

"I’m not looking to become a queen, I swear, and I don’t mean that to be mean. I’m just trying to help you, and help you and make you better."

He turned to her, "I don’t know what to do. I’m just trying," he said, biting down on his lip in slight frustration.

"I’m trying to make you better, and help you make better choices. I’ll try to see if you are, too."

"I won’t," I scowled back at him, my fingers going to my temples in frustration.

"I’m just trying to do something that I trust that you won’t do." He chuckled and shook his head, "You know what? You are not doing it for my good. You are doing it for your father."

"You are being a very difficult person," I commented, patting him on the back. He looked up at me, "I know."

"I’m trying to help you, though I said, causing him to turn his head slowly and stare at me.

"I know you are trying to help because you’re trying to help me, that’s all."I looked down at him, "I’m sorry, I’m sorry."

"I’m not," he said, looking back at me.

"I’ve been trying to help you for years, even before I found out you’re going to be the Dark Lord."

"You got all these pieces together," I said, looking at him with a small smile.

"I can tell you."He took a sip of his drink, and he leaned down to kiss Elias’s cheek, the other two taking turns to kiss him back."Come here, I’ll make you a better king," he promised him.As he sat down with his hands on the table, he received a kiss on the head from Peter, who was looking at him with a vaguely neutral expression. Oh, he looked... blonde.

"You’re the only one of us who feels comfortable enough to be made king," he said, looking back to the spot where he had been sitting.

"But you’re not the only one of us who doesn’t."

 eyes widened.

"That’s so much more than a set of rules," she said, "It’s the world’s only thing that has ever stopped me from wanting to go back to Hogwarts." She looked up at the sky, "And that’s why you’re in here?" She asked. Her senses grew and she pulled her wand out, pushing the curtains shut.

"You always have to come back." She waved her wand, and the curtains opened again.

"I’ll be the last one to get out." She looked around, "You’re not going to be around her for long."

"Well, I’ll wait." He smiled softly, "I’ll let you know when we’re back."She nodded, leaning closer to him, "I’ll do to her what I did to you."

"You forgive me for being so quick to believe that you did all this to her," he said, "but it’s fine when you have to keep her safe. She’s always safe, through you." She sighed, "I’m just glad you’re back." She looked at him, "I’ll see you soon."Harry shrugged.

"Good luck finding out about her, Potter."Harry laughed at that and went to his closet. He was still wearing his Quidditch robes, he had his wand and had a thick coat. He tried to feel better as he continued with his homework and whatever was not in his desk.The next day, Harry found that he couldn’t find his homework. He was standing in front of a desk and was leaning against it. Professor Balk had asked him to sit, but Harry didn’t want to go. Harry had a feeling that he couldn’t go, but it gave him pause as he realized he couldn’t."I’m sorry he said.

"I’d rather go out and search for food."I nodded silently, smiling at him.

"Goodness me."

"You’re welcome," he said, giving me a reassuring smile.

"And I’ll do your best to avoid your father."

"I can’t hate you," I said, taking the offered hand and pulling my friends to us. I took them to the private bedroom and sat down."You have been quiet all evening," I said.

"I’m worried about you, and I’m just worried about what’s going to happen next."

"I’ll have to tell you what’s happening." Bucky said.

"I’ll be there."

"I’ll...  I’ll take care of it."

"If you want to help us, we can help you."

Steve shook his head.

"Don’t be. I’ll be there, and whatever I say, I’ll be there."

"I don’t know what I can do for you." Steve said.

"I can’t just walk away from the fight, can I?"Steve nodded.

"I know that’s a thing, but don’t you want to talk?"

"I’m not going to argue with you. Just don’t come back here and say you don’t want to," Steve said.

"I’ll just stay here."

It was still early in the morning, and the sun was setting, but Steve was still feeling the pounding in his chest.He wanted to find a way to get out, but it was a lot more fun to run off without a fight.He tossed his shirt over his head, taking a deep breath."So, the thing is, I don’t know how she got here, but I heard about it. I’m just worried," Ron told Harry and Susan.

"Just worried about what happens tomorrow."

"And how do you know about this?" Susan asked."You’re helping me," Harry said.

"I’m helping you."

"Okay," Susan said.

"Let’s go."

"S-sorry," Harry muttered.

"I’m sorry, man. I mean, I’m sorry."

"I’m sorry," Harry said.

"I sorry to have hurt you. I’m sorry to have hurt you. I’m sorry to have made you worry for me."

"You didn’t mean that," Ginny said, looking at him.

"You were just saying that you were sorry. You were just saying that, and then you started hurting me. I mean, you’re right, that’s okay, but I’m not a liar, okay? I don’t know how to help you, okay?"

"I mean, you can’t promise that, but you can promise that until you try, I’ll find you a way to fix it."

"I am always your brother," the Prince said.

"I am, but I’m not your father," I said, my voice falling into a whisper.

"The truth is, I have never told you anything about my mother, and I don’t know what you’ve found out about my sister, despite the fact that you have asked me what happened to the others. You have been my best friend since I was a child, and I’ve been my best friend since my parents died."

"No," I said.

"I’d been a member of the royal family since the day I was young, but I’m a long time family."

"What?" I looked at Severus.

"Why?"

"Well, you’ve been an active member of the family since you were a very young child."

"I know he’s a prince," he said, giving me a smile.

"I’m glad for that." I nodded, feeling a little more confident, and he nodded. He’d forgotten about me after that, I thought, and I smiled again.

"You must have missed me." He gave me a hand to my cheek, "I’ll never ask you to come back."

"I will." He smiled at me and looked at the table.

"You are very useful."He looked at Draco, which caused me to laugh.

"I would never."

"Fair enough," Draco replied.

"I’m more useful than you are, after all."

"I’m more useful than you," I said, looking at Draco.

"But I’m not your cousin, I’ve never made friends, I never even made friends with anyone." He smirked, "You are an amazing student, I’m glad to have you on my side when you go on your best behavior."

"I am, I’m so glad," Draco teased, making her laugh softly."Don’t be so stupid," she said, "I’m not sure if you know it’s the best way to say those words with a smile."

"I don’t care, I didn’t mean to," he reassured her, "We’re already friends, we need to be friends, I know that."

"I know," she said, hugging him tight and holding him close, "I know that."

" know," he said, "I know... " He let out a soft sigh, and smiled himself, he could finally relax.

"I trust you are still worried about me."

"Oh, I’ll be fine," Draco said, and with a small, silent sigh, he took another deep breath and sighed, "I’ll be fine. Let’s go home."He took another deep breath and pulled away and leaned against the wall, trying to catch his breath, "You are too much to pull off."

"I’m not a doctor," said Draco, "I’ll get you what you need."

"My dad is a great man," said Harry, "but I can’t see him doing anything but what he needs."

"Well, you’re not a doctor," Draco said."I mean, he’s a good man, he is," Harry said, "but there’s something about him that just makes you feel like you’re a burden."

"I know that," Draco said.

"I know that he’s a good man. But when he’s angry, he’s just taken over my life more than anything else." are the worst." Harry sighed.

"I am, I mean it."

"I’m not the worst," Ron said.

"I’m just fucking mad."

"Harry," Ron said.

"You’re not the worst," he said, and both Harry and Ron looked at each other. Harry shrugged.

"I guess that is just what happens when you don’t act like a fucking child."

"I’m the worst," Harry said.

"I’m so sorry, I really am."Ron nodded, and left them both standing in the common room. Harry felt a little bit better than he had done last year, and looked around for the other people in the castle. He found what he was looking for, and found his favorite spot to do it.The rest of the day was spent in the common room. Harry tried to ignore the grimness of the Slytherins, knowing that they were all in there. Hermione had told Hermione that she had a memory of one of the Gryffindors that had been the subject of the news at the end of the year, and Harry had told her about it when she had asked him to find her. She had said that she hoped that they would finally get a memory of a Weasley family that she could look forward to finding.The rest of the class returned to their usual levels of frustration. Harry had been assigned to Professor Balk, and he was being assigned to Slytherin, which was no different than the rest of the classes. He received a stern lecture about the importance of doing a proper homework assignment as usual and the need to get an essay out of the way so that he could focus on his work. He was barely keeping up with the excitement of the class and had to cancel to save his money on what he thought was a book he had to buy. Professor Balk was the only other person to leave, and Harry did not want to bother him. He was dismissed and marched out of the classroom. The rest of the students were still not satisfied with the assignments and the time it took for them to return to their dorms."Can I ask you a question," the Professor asked, "Or rather, ask me what set us apart from the rest?"

"I would like to hear it first," Harry said, "I mean, I think I’ll just have to ask a more specific question."The Slytherins continued to talk in silence. Professor McGonagall seemed to be going over the list of things they’d wanted to ask Harry, and Professor Balk was watching Harry’s progress in the classroom.In their fifth year, the Gryffindors were given a second task for the year, which was to superv the rebuilding of the castle. He could’ve easily become the head of the Ministry, or at least he wouldn’t have to worry about being elected Prime Minister.

He’d started to get a bit paranoid about what was going on around him, and once he and the others realized that he was in fact the new Prime Minister, they all grew a bit more lax.

He was afraid to ask any questions himself, but he did his best to put out the fire and get things going, and he got things started quickly.

When he was done with the task, the most important thing to get done was to get Harry safely out of Slytherin’s dungeons.
