"There is a problem," Harry said with a bit of guilt.

"I have to go back to my room."

"That’s okay," Ron said.

"As soon as you can, come on."Harry did, and soon after, they were heading out of the manor. Harry had never gotten to go in the hallway before. It was only a rare chance that he got there, and it was a lot more than just a hallway."Harry," Ron said.

"This is where you get a lot of your homework. I’ll be back."

"You’re going to be late," Harry said, "I’m sorry."

"I’ll be back. Come, Harry," Draco said, and they left the room.After the two had tried to leave the house, they went to the boys’ dormitory to sleep. Harry and Draco found themselves at Malfoy Manor, where the gray haired creatures were all looking at him. Harry and Draco stood up and started pacing."What are you doing?" Draco questioned."I’m about to be found," Harry said.

"How long are you going to be here?"

"I just got a lot of homework," Draco shrugged."Oh, I glad," Harry said.

"I can’t wait to see what they’re planning together. I’m glad you’d like to see the three of us."

"We’re friends," Ron said."We’re friends," Harry said, knowing that the Slytherins would want to share information about what he’d learned.He was glad to see that Hermione was the only one of the four not to be on the record for secretly liking the Dark Mark.

"I’m sure Hermione would love to have more friends," he said."I’m not your best friend," she said, "but you can always find someone else who’s the same."

"If you’re like me, I’ll be more than happy to give you my bed," Harry said. He opened his eyes and smiled widely.

"You can have your own, of course, but I’m so happy to have you."

"I’m sure you’ll find someone ready to make the rounds," she said, turning to her boyfriend.

"They’re quite the spectacle."

"I’ll be there," Harry promised."I’ll be there, and you’ be safe!" Hermione said darkly. They looked around at all the people around them. They all looked at her with a mix of confusion and shock."She’s just a lovely young woman," Harry said.

"I’ll be there." He headed towards the door.

"She’s good looking too."

"And proud," Ron said.

"She’s a fine young woman."

"And you’re a good one too," Harry said.

"You’re very nice, Draco."

"No, I’m not," Draco said.

" not," he said.

"I’m just an idiot."

"And you’re a very nice person," Harry said.

"I mean, I’m just a very nice person, and I’m an idiot, and I’m not going to be like you."

"Then why are you saying nothing?" Draco asked.

"You’re just a pretty stupid person and you’re a great thing."

"I’m just a pretty stupid person," Harry said, and he said it ten times the number of times that he really needed to.

"I sure you’re slimy," he said as good as he could manage.

"There are plenty of people in the Order who look at you as if you’re the perfect person to take on the Order. You’re not going to get the job if you don’t. And I’m sure you’d take care of all your own business if you could."

"I know," Harry whispered.

"I know, I know. I’ll deal with it. But I’ll deal with it."

"I, uh, if we were ever to pass through the Forbidden Forest, I do believe that would be nice I do believe that he would be fine, but you are so far away. 

"I have come to collect you and take you to my quarters. It is okay, but I want you to know that we are going to be made to wait. I am not going to do anything stupid," he tells her.

"I just want you to be safe." 

She nods, and with a smile she enters the room and goes to the dormitories. 

I don’t need to sit here. 

"I will be here," I say softly. 

I keep my eyes on her as I tell her that I have found the perfect pair of shoes to store it for her. 

She looks up at me and I snap my fingers. 

"My Lord, you are the first one to mind the shoes" Draco is saying. 

"I will be the first to get them" I say. 

"Thank you Draco, I will really appreciate it" Draco pushes me away and I roll my eyes, my head is spinning. 

Before I can ask him to help me with my homework I get a letter from Draco. 

I don’t want to tackle this, but it is a whole lot of homework, I need to organize it for my own needs. just blinked and looked at him, "That’s... " He said, and then looked at him, "You didn’t just give me anything, did you?"

"No," Harry said, "You took care of everything."

"I told you that," Ron said, "I’m going to start planning my own homework."

"You’ll have to," Harry said.

"I’m sure you’ll, but I’m sure you’ll have to do your own homework, too."

"I know," Ron hummed. well," Harry said.

"So," he said, "I’ll just get my robes and go and look for a place where I can show you what I think is probably what they’re going to do."He watched Ron’s robes for a moment. If they were going to kill him, he would have done it in front of the warlock, but he didn’t think it was as dangerous to take them out. He thought better of it. He shrugged a little, hoping that Harry would be able to follow them. But as soon as they disappeared, Harry was looking for a place to hide.He knew that he would have to get to the monastery quickly and hurry to get back to the main hall. He had promised Mozenrath that he would check on everyone and then he was going to leave again and find a place to hide.He was not about to wait around for a sudden attack. He could not care less, for he would find the place and then he would leave. The crowd was already there, and if he did not leave soon then the guards would be able to see him. If he didn't leave then they would be able to see him. He had his own plan, he would leave and find a place to hide, and then he would return to the main hall unnoticed. He had to do it.He did not want to stay in that place He did not want to stay in the orphanage. He had thought that maybe the public could do a better job of housing people who desperately wanted to stay.He did not want to leave the castle. He had to make his way to his room to wake up.He dreamt of a place of peace in this castle, where he could not be alone. He dreamed of a place that kept him safe and safe.He dreams of a place that gave him courage and gave him love.He dreamed of a place that protected him.It was a place that reminded him of himself, where he could choose his own path.He dreams of a place that gave him hope. It was a place that always gave him hope.Dumbledore sat in silence for a few moments, but as the minutes passed, Dumbledore did not speak. Professor Quirrell stood up and Severus Snape stepped in."What are you doing here?" Severus asked."I am teaching you Defense Against the Dark Arts," Dumbledore said."Not to the Dark Arts?" Severus asked."You are clearly a master of spells," Dumbledore said.

"I am teaching you Defence Against the Dark Arts. I am going to show you the most important lesson of this semester, and you will be taking the first action."

"I’ll be the first to stand," Snape said, "and the second to stand was surprised to hear that they had taken a while to stand, for they were always so tired and tired. Watching Ron, I wondered what I’d missed, and wondering if he’d wake up."You have a lovely morning," Professor Dumbledore was saying.

"Do you have anyone else to tell me?"

"I’ve read some of your books," I said, feeling a little guilty for interrupting him so easily."Listen, Severus. We have a few days to talk, but I want you to go to bed. I’ll think of something to show you."He nodded reluctantly and closed the book.

" last time you’d tried to do that was when you found a letter laying on the bed of Grimmauld Place."

"I don’t know what to say," Ron muttered.

"You said there was a message?"

"I don’t know what to say," Hermione sighed.

"I’m sure it’s just a memory shoved into the corner of your mind, I didn’t mean to hurt him."

"And you did that?" he asked with a raised eyebrow.She nodded.

"Don’t be so sure about your future plans Susan, I’ll have to ask what did you intend to do when you learned about your mother’s doing magic."

"The best we can hope for is that you will have a peaceful life as well," Harry said, turning back to Draco.

"Even if you’re going back through the Dark Lord’s dungeons, I wouldn’t want you to go through all of his trials."

"I know," Draco sighed.

"But I just think that you will need to find a way to do that, and that you will have to accept that your mother’s magic will burn her alive, and that her magic is going to be used against you."

"But then I want you to be the one to do the work," I said, reaching up to squeeze my hand in a gesture of support.

"I’ll just have to look at you."We walked past a few people who seemed to be enjoying themselves and I was glad to see Draco and Blaise standing in front of the twins with their best friends. I looked around for them, but they were all looking at me as we walked down the grounds."Surely you’re not going after anyone who didn’t walk in here tonight," Draco said, "I’m Blaise Zabini, after all, who’s a disgrace to the house. I’m Blaise, too," Draco states, "but Blaise Zabini’s the only one who knows how to use the Imperius Curse."

"Draco!" Blaise practically yells, "What the bloody hell’s going on?!"

"What do you mean, I’m Blaise," Draco states, "I’m Blaise, too, and Blaise’s the only one who knows how to use the Imperius Curse."

"Heh," Blaise says, "Blaise Zabini’s got a knack for it."

"Oh, yeah," Harry’s face turns.

"He’s got it after all." He glances at Blaise.

"You’re right, I’m right," he says.

"I’m just having a good time with my friends, Blaise."

"I’m sure you and Draco have fun with this guy," Blaise smirks.

"Harry, I need you to beat him."Harry takes a deep breath before he tries to keep his voice calm.

"I can beat him," he says.

"I so sorry. I’m so sorry for what happened. I promised to do my best. I’ll try my best to keep it that way."

Taehyung trains his arms on the hilt of his sword, feeling the keenness of his heart and the pain in his chest, all in slow motion. (Especially when the pain is accompanied by a heavy crash and a quick knock on the door.)

But with each sip of the medicine he tugs into his mouth, his heart slows and his breaths slow. The last few seconds are spent in a flurry of clenching and pushing, but Taehyung can’t focus on anything.

His heart slows again as he leans against his chest, watching over Taehyung with barely hidden affection.

"I love you," he whispers.

"You’re so good, Tae."And he's not going to say it again, not without a spot of warning. He’s just going to let his expression grow, and he wants to pull Taehyung closer as he wraps his arms around Taehyung’s neck and kisses him. He wants to taste his lips, to taste the softness of his skin against his skin as he kisses at his neck and back, breathing in the scent of every single ingredient Taehyung has to offer."You wanna play with me? he asks, pressing both hands against Taehyung’s back.

"I’ll crush you if you don’t."

Taehyung laughs, holding Jungkook’s hand and tugging him closer until they’re laying on the couch. He leans into Jungkook’s hold as he looks up at him, his lips kissing along the edge of Jungkook’s shirt.

He can’t be serious. There’s only one way to truly love someone and that’s with love.

"Sure thing," he murmurs.

"I’ll enjoy it, maybe I’ll catch you up a bit before you leave."Elias thinks about that, the fact that the man is clearly more concerned with his own wellbeing than his own look. He can’t help but feel a little jealous, because probably that is what he was looking for in someone he cares about so deeply. He will probably end up on the other side of Mooreland, in the woods, probably on the other side of the castle with the other vampires.Elias is grateful for the offer and leaves, he will be able to pick him up soon.

He waits on the path, Peter and his friends are at the stable and he follows them.

"You have a good mind, he is told, nodding at the man in a kind and polite way. He is about to leave when the boy in the stable grabs him by the waist and pulls him closer.

"Stop, you are just too stubborn!" He yells and the other man is left in his spot.

"So you are," he says.

"That’s all you need." He stops before he can ask again.

"Are you sure you want to go?"

"Yeah, I would, but I’m not sure if I would’ve wanted to. I just needed some time to calm myself down."

"Well then, let us do it. It’s done." The door closed behind him, and he bent to look up at her, not trusting his eyes to trust her at all.

"You’re a good witch, aren’t you?" she questioned, getting up and taking the time to look him back down.

"I can’t believe you just broke up with someone who’d raised so many of us."He laughed at her question, although it was a bit weak.

"I know that I’ve given everyone a hard time, but I’m not going to give anyone a hard time." He shook his head.  worry, I can help you. I’m the one who has your mom’s phone," he said.Draco could see her light skin and the way her eyes were closed, his mind racing. He knew from the way she was squeezing his hand, that she was hurting him. He had to convince himself he was right. He had to give her the best possible care. She would only hurt herself.He tried to think how he could say it like that, but he couldn’t. He would just get her back and die. There was no way back then that she could harm him. He and Draco would have to think more clearly about this.
