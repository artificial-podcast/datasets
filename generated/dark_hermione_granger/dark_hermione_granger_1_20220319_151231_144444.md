Hermione Granger dropped down to the snowy ground, her eyes glistening with tears.

"I meant to say that I love you for all I have, but I'll never be able to love you as well." She reached out and took her hand, "I love you too, Hermione. I love you as well."Hermione rolled her eyes, letting go of her heart.

"I loved you, Hermione. But I just don't know how." She let her hand go, and they both looked at each other.

"I think I told you the truth, dear, but I'm afraid I don't know the whole truth. What do you want me to do?"

"I want you to kill every single person that tries to save me," Hermione said, sitting down and taking the seat across from her.

"So, if you've got to do it, how did you get in touch with her?"

"Well, not really, but you're the only person that can tell me."

"Good. I will tell you one thing, I'll be the one to tell you that she's a Granger. I heard about her in one of the books."

"She used to be one," Hermione said, staring at the woman's face.

"I think she looks like one of the Purebloods to me."

"Well then, let's see how she looks before we decide," Draco told her. He pushed the woman's hair away from her face, turning her into a pillow.

"You're in the same room as me I have to go, but I'm convinced that you'll be okay." Harry held up two arms to his friend.

"We're both in the same bed. Oh, I think I'm going to have to fight this. We're both going to the Hospital Wing. Come on, come on, you've already been in here for a whole month. You and Hermione are going to fight this all together."



"I don't have to fight, Harry! I'm not in the mood!" Hermione's arms pulled her into a hug, and Harry was able to hold her close.

"We just have to go into the Hospital Wing and make it better. You are a genius and I am a shit mum."The next morning, Hermione found herself at the foot of the Astronomy Tower and wished that she'd never stooped to that level. It was what she believed her parents should be proud of. As an adult, she was grateful for the privilege, even though she didn't feel like she was the same person she used to be."Hermione, I know you're always thinking of yourself as a genius, but I also know that you're just like everyone else."Theodore Nott snapped at her.

"Why don't you tell me why you're here, Nott?"

"I wanted to ask the twins why they see me as a special case, but they've already figured it out."

"No one ever told them you were a tracker," Ron breathed, pulling his attention back to Hermione.

"They would have to claim you as one of their victims, and claim you as the person responsible for the torture."

"I know that, and they're completely believable," Hermione said.

"But I don't think they're good enough to be trusted."

"You have no idea how much they care and care so much about you."

"I don't. Not at all. I just have a few questions for you."There was a pause, just to be sure, before Ron let himself answer them.

"What do you want to know?"

"Everything," Hermione said.

"Who are the victims?"

"Harry," Ron answered, looking around the room.

"I don't think they have the right to try and take a child yet."

"Ooh, I see. Well, let's hear what they want to say first." Harry's eyes went to the chair across the table from them.

"I can't believe you think of this. I've never heard of a witch or wizard having a child before, and I'm sure they were never in touch with their future."

"I don't know what you're talking about, Harry," Ron interrupted, his eyes shining with mischief.

"I just know that you two are the most hated people in this entire Wizarding world. You're both going to hell if you don't stop your fangirls. Ron, you're a monster. If only you could be like them just wish I could be like them," Harry admitted, struggling not to chuckle at his friend's words.

"I mean, I know that Ron and Hermione would be horrified by what's happened to them. They are a family. But they are strong and beautiful people. And I think you've got to be better than them, right?"

"I think you're right," Harry snarked, leaning forward to kiss his best friend.



Harry had to admit that his relationship with Ron had changed. The two men had always been quite friendly and friendly even back when they were in Hogwarts. Now, they were intimidating and quite distant. Ron had been a bit more; he seemed distant, unsure, unsure of himself. But even in the face of all that, he hadn't given himself up to being unafraid. He didn't think he would ever be able to prove himself worthy of being in his father's court, or his head. He tried. Sometimes he tried to play the long game.



The last thing Severus wanted to do was rush into the ritual. The last thing he wanted was to be the one who had to watch over the child. His patience was already running out.



"Severus," he whispered, and his eyes opened to stare at the table in front of him.

"I see you. I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you everything."



"It's over, my boy. What are you going to do now?" She asked, her eyes burning with the intense glare he was used to from her. He had to bite back a grin so much that it made her smile wider.

"I thought you and I would stay a couple of nights. And you?"

"You being the man you are today is a compliment, isn't it?" He asked, his eyes growing heavy with anxiety, unable to continue."I know. I don't know what to say, but I feel so sorry for you, Hermione. You're a piece of shit." She said, falling silent."I am. I don't want to hurt you. I'm not even sure if I should cry." He said, his hand coming up to wrap around her waist. She doesn't know what to do next.

"I need to use the Imperius on you." He said, placing his hand on her jaw and pulling her closer.

"I can't take advantage of your weakness, right now."

"Well, I'm a witch, so I can't hurt you. I don't have a wand to use against you. And, you're cheating on your husband."

"What? I don't believe it." She said, trying to not scream.

"I don't have a wand, and he's cheating on me."

"No. You don't. He's your husband."

"I've known Draco for a few years now. He's been with us since we first started dating. It's been our goal to keep this going through this and make sure we don't get hurt at the end of the year. He's been a real help. Even when I needed him, he was my only friend. He's been a constant source of support. He's been a good mum. I'm not surprised that I've been chosen to go to Hogwarts, I didn't know about this choice. I'm a smart student, I learned from the Dark Lord. I don't give a single second where I am going to fail him or even make him suffer.Hermione and Theo both have their eyes open, they don't know what is going to happen next. Just like the twins, they are trying to survive, to survive. They are not living anymore, and they are not going to rest until they are better." He said with a smile."I’m glad I left. I could have left and gone a lot worse." Alyssa said softly, trying to break the tension."We need to get out of here," Daphne said, trying to sound proud of her brother."What do you need to do?" Pansy asked, her eyebrows turning to the red."I want to get out of here," Daphne said, looking at the twins, who lifted their head, holding their hands up in front of them.

"I think I’ be okay, I like you," he offers and wraps an arm around me.

"I love you too," I whisper as we walk towards the library.

"We need to do this together, I can’t have someone else reading this." I am in the library now, but I am alone and still surrounded by books.

"I am not reading books, I read," I whispered.

"I want to see you," he smirks at me, but I know that I won’t like this.

"We are going to the library together." I walk up the stairs as I hear Father call out his room.

"Are you alright?" I see Father walking up the stairs and closing his door behind him. I look to the left and hear him whisper to me, "I think I’ll be alright." He sits down and my eyes meet his.

"I think you want to be with me."

"Of course," he agrees.

"We’ll be fine."

"We’ll walk down the aisle and join you all." I follow him out of the room and onto the stairs. I walk up to the second room, the furthest from the small group. I walk along the narrow staircase and step through the flower beds. The two of us walk up to the table to sit down. I can’t think of anything else.

"I’m going to bed and you get to go back to your room." Ron nods and takes the seat across from me.

"I’ll be right back." I nod and go.

"You will."

"I’ll be by your room before you go back to your room."

"You’ll stay here until your next class." He walks in and grabs my hand.

"We need to go to your room."

"Of course." I walk inside the room and immediately take a seat. I look around and everyone is looking at the table. Draco is sitting next to me, but his arm is wrapped in a cloak. Narcissa is next to me, but her eyes are dark. I don’t even see the group of people that we are joining.

"I’m surprised, you’re already the best." Draco whispers.

"I don’t think I’m the only one," I sigh deeply.

"Our group isn’t as big as ours," he shrugs.

"But it is this big."

"Me?" I ask. He nods and I am confused as to why we are at dinner. It is the first day of the new year. We have a meeting with the other houses. Father mentioned that he is going to make a statement here.

"We are going to be late." Harry answered as he entered the room and shrunk a letter out of his study, holding it out to the fire.

"I’m sure we can get some wine." Harry handed over his steak and pork.

"Thank you." Fred and George shared a knowing look before they walked away.

"This isn’t the first time that we have a meeting." Harry nodded as he opened the letter.

"We did it." Harry opened the letter and read the word ‘two’ "I’m sorry." It seemed like a lie. How could they have forgotten? Had they already forced themselves to write to each other? The secret of the letters was out. A letter had been sent to him and he’d already received it. How had they gotten it? All the details were hazy, but it was clear that he didn’t want to forget them. He’d be the one to tell him the truth. Why hadn’t he opened his own letter by now? If he didn’t know any better, he’d be surprised how often someone had shared the same information. He had done it more than once, and he wasn’ the only one.



This time, Severus’s hand shot out to slap the parchment across the top of the desk. He was able to take a few steps back, but not nearly enough to make the Slytherins lose their wits.



The parchment was written in the Malfoy tongue, and the Slytherins panicked.



"What the... ?" Severus’ voice was sharp.



"I don’t know, I know he’s been through it."



Severus swallowed.

"I’m sure you’re the only one who knows."



"I’ll admit it to you, Malfoy," Hermione said, trying to be as non-narcissistic as possible."When you call me a mudblood, what do you really mean?" Draco asked, holding up his hands."It’s not a subtle way to refer to me," Pansy said in a very fake voice.

"It’s more accurate."Hermione stared at Draco for a moment, waiting for what he would say."No, it’s not." she said, holding up her hand.

"I do mean what I say. It’s a shame that you don’t know my family," she added. felt sick. Maybe she’d never have been raised by a Death Eater. Perhaps she didn’t even know what it was like to be a Muggleborn. And she would have to learn about the Dark magic and how those with a Dark Mark were able to exist in the wizarding world for so long. But Hermione knew she was not a wizard for nothing. She was the only one alive who actually knew how to take control of the situation. In the end, it was up to her. She could tell him everything."That’s why I’m not a wizard," she finally said.

"I’m not old enough to master the art." lord, my lord," Hermione said.

"I certainly would not be able to look after my family. I would not have any grandchildren."

"You would not be able to care for yourself, Ms. Granger. You would keep on living as a mere house elf, please!"

"I would not take my family for granted!"

"I would join your family in Hogwarts, Lord Potter. I would do my best to keep you from becoming a Lich if you ever need me!" she said.

"I’ll help you, if you ever need me!"

"I can help you! I’m Hermione Granger!" he cried, leaping up and down in joy, shooting kisses down her face and reaching for Harry’s in a wave."So what is my name? Is it not your Mother?"

"It’s my name!" he cried again, this time with happiness.

"Do you want to call me Harry? I am your Godfather!"

"I can’t! I am not your Godfather!" he cried again, his eyes turning to white.

"No!"

"No you won’t!" he cried, jumping up and down, his hands shaking with anger.

"Now go!" he cried again, his voice becoming angry as his whole body became frozen. The moment he let go, his head turned towards the door, the cold metal in his hand turning pale blue. But then the cold blue rose again, the sharp feel of it hitting the skin, the sharp feel of it hitting his shoulder. He threw his head back as hard as he could, his expression turning into horror. He broke the contact, his magic becoming dull as his body started to burn from the force of the contact.

"No time to go!" he cried again, his anger turning into anger and frustration shooting through his chest.
