Albus, do you really think it is safe to just forget about this? You’re somehow involved in all this, and I doubt your friends will let you out of their kindness." Ginny said, her eyes going wild.

"I don’t want to see you and your little group of friends hurt, and I don’t want to see you and your friends hurt." A look of understanding was on Ginny’s face, and she gave in.

"I’m sorry, but I’m going to have to do something." She followed up Ginny’s apology with a wink and a nod.A few minutes later, Hermione finally emerged from the bathroom, feeling slightly better. She put her wand away and ran back to the kitchen. 

 Bertrand was in the kitchen, looking even more pale than usual. His eyes were narrowed and dark, burning his farce, and his hair was pulled back in a messy bun. He was breathing heavily, the sound unnerving him. 

 "Bastard," he murmured. 

 "What are you doing here, Bertrand?" asked Ron. 

 The wizard turned to look at her, and she took in his appearance. 

 He was dressed entirely in black and had dark, messy hair. The lacy curls were pulled back so the side of his head looked like it was about to go bald. 

 "I saw you floo" Draco’s voice was calm and calm.

"I’m a good person" Draco gave him a smirk.

"I’m not good at this" Draco pretended not to notice the two girls laughing their way through dinner.

"You two are so very smart" Blaise smirked.

"I’m so glad you both got along" Theo sniggered.

"Oh come on boy" Draco sniggered.

"You’re the best at this!" Blaise cried.

"You can’t talk about this" Draco snarked.

"I did even know what I was talking about!" he cried.

"You did?" Luna asked shaking her head.

"No, that is not the case! You told me that your father and I were dating and were married and you are not!" she cried.

"You are trying to use me like a lover, you know" she snarled.

"You are just jealous of me, you think I love you?" she said glaring at him.

"You were just lying, you could have just told me" she said annoyed.

"I know, but I still wouldn’t have said that, I would have told you the truth, we would have had to leave, we just don't know even what to do'."Theo nodded.

"I thought that meant that you didn't want me around though. I didn't want to hear the tale of a lost and scared girl."

"Oh, I know. I'm glad I didn't. It's more than either of us can handle."Hermione frowned.

"It's none of my business how you're treated, Draco. You're my friend."

"I know, but I'm not your problem, Penny. You just need to talk to me."

"No, I'm not your problem. Just talk to someone who is listening. Besides, I know how much you hate how little you see me in these situations. I know what you and Draco are up to. You'll be fine, little wolf. Now take it as you wish, while I restore your strength and magic to you." He holds up his hands, feeling the blood on them. Harry looks over the photo, noticing blood on the carpet. Looking at his best friend, Draco’s head falls out of the air. Harry looks at his friend, he is wearing a dark purple, and the blood on the floor is a stark contrast. Harry winces, when he looks at his best friend, he is holding a photo. Harry grabs the photo and holds it to Draco’s chest."Do you know what’s going on?" Harry whispers in a worried tone. I don’t. I just got a letter and I wanted to ask what it was."

"Sounds like it’s been bothering you for a while now." Hermione looks up from her new book."I was just reading and couldn’t sleep. I didn’t realize that this was the reason I got this letter." Harry looks up from his book."Huh?" Hermione looks at her reflection in the mirror.

"I didn’t get a letter." She wraps her arms around Harry and lets go of his face.

"I want to tell you everything right now." Harry smiles.

"We are already talking about an entire year." It is easy to understand, they are looking into the depths of the soul bond.

"Why do we need to be so careful?" Hermione asks.

"Because we are both already marked." Harry nods.

"And we don’t need to reveal the Death-Eaters to every student." Blaise laughs.

"Blaise," Draco wraps his arms around his neck.

"Do you want to be the perfect little wolf, mate?" Theo asks.

"Yes, we are all named after the four living things, but we are all just human and we get it." Harry laughs.  you can’t!" Hermione snorts, her eyes are bright red, but they are clearly not as pink as her cheeks. Draco is right. It is time for dinner, they are staying at Grimmauld Place, at least until Professor Snape can come back. They need to have a good dinner, they are not going to be able to talk for a month, they need their friends and family to help them. We are going to the Muggle library, after lunch they will be in Gryffindor, the only reason Hermione is staying is she is the best friend in her group. Harry is going to the library, he has been looking for a book about dragon fauna since he was 11. He is happy to help me with translations as it is very interesting, but I am not sure how to translate it. I hope you can be of help. Also, I would like to ask you to help me with a project, as it is my first project and I don’t want to take it out on everyone. I have told you that I will help you with it, but I am not sure if that is enough. I have a very friendly way to help people, and I don’t want to take it out on everyone. I hope you are very happy. If there is anyone I can help you with, it is Blaise. I am sorry to disappoint you, I am not used to helping people, I am more a teacher and not my teacher."The door shut behind Draco, a hand reaching for her and pulling her towards him. He turned around, eyes wide and cold, but not cold and not bright.

"You are my father, Hermione, and I think it is time for you to move on. I have a feeling that you aren't going to like what I am about to do to you."

"I know, I know. I don't like you changing people's mind, Draco. I'm sorry about your father, but I don't like it." She turned away, looking at him.

"I know. I would never hurt you."Draco made his way towards her, his hands on her hips and his teeth on the top of her head.

"Don't you ever come again!" She replied, her body spasming with desire.

"I always thought that you were the most beautiful woman I ever met."The words left his mouth as he made his way to her.

"You are a creep." He continued as he entered her mouth.

"Don't ever hurt me."She leaned back into his arms and whispered the magic into her ear.

"I love you, Draco."Draco kissed her skin and kissed her deeply as he went deeper into her.

"I love you too, Hermione." He pulled back, his hand reaching around to touch her hair.

"You should leave now."

"I love you too, Draco." She kissed him, softly, eyes barely remaining level with his.

"Don't you ever leave." Draco kissed her again, feeling a rush of energy to leave and never come back.

"I will never, ever see you like this again, love, Draco."Hermione was breathing heavily, feeling her eyes burn with tears.

"I love you too, Hermione." Draco kissed her again, feeling a rush of energy to leave and never come back.

"I wish you better things to do, Hermione." Draco kissed her again, feeling a rush of energy to leave and never come back.

"I never meant to hurt you like this. I never meant to hurt you like this." She kissed again, feeling a rush of energy to leave and hurry away.

"I need to get back to the castle."Narcissa's eyes were screwed shut.

"No ...  I ... " The words were stuck in her head even after she was finished with the last paragraph. She wanted to go back to the castle, to the Great Hall in the Common Room. The next time, she would like to get her head in the sand and tell her that she would have to return to the castle. The sinking feeling in her stomach was similar to that of a sinking ship. 

 "Where is Hermione?"

"I've never come here, you know."

"I always came here on my own."It might have hurt her, she remembered, but Hermione had a way of separating herself from people. She could use the time apart to her advantage. Other people often got suspicious of her as well. That was no way to live. All she needed to do was tell the wizard that she was different from the others. She felt like she was living for the simple pleasure of being alone.When she was feeling particularly isolated, she would stare at a mirror until she was blue in the face. If the mirror was mirror magic, she knew that she would find herself staring at her own reflection. A pastel blue eyes that had a dark purple tinted them. She looked just like the girl she used to be. She was taller, heavier, more handsome. She was slimmer than the man she had been with. Perhaps she was only a possession in this life, but she was still the most innocent of the innocent. What had once been a family was now just a collection of families. Antonin held her hand in his and whispered a promise that he would help her with whatever she needed. He would be just as thankful for her as he would be in the future. It would be a long process, but it would be worth it.Sighing in relief, Pansy took a deep breath and stepped forward. She was glad that she had the chance to talk to the man again and not worry about his feelings. It was too hard to talk to someone who was trying to talk her into agreeing to marry him. She rolled over to face Antonin."I thought you wanted to be with me."The tears began to fall, and she felt the coldest, most pressing of love for her husband. There was something so raw and raw between them, and she was lost. She wanted to leave him. She wanted him to love her. She wanted to move on. It was not that her life was a vacation that she could just walk away from. They were only as strong as their convictions and convictions were. She needed to open her heart and see how far she could push her husband to go. 

 Over the past few weeks, Hermione had been traveling. She'd been thinking about Antonin. Every single day she was thinking about her husband. She'd just been pretending to tell him the truth when he just been too afraid to tell her. Maybe it was the sort of thing that she would do. She would tell him she was afraid, but she didn't like being just about to reveal something that could potentially end up in her hands. If she was honest with her husband, she knew he was worried about her too. She didn't like Antonin at all, but she didn't much care. As much as he might want to punish her, that wasn't something that was likely to happen. She was smart enough to understand that he would do anything to keep her safe. It was just that she was tired of her husband telling her everything. Perhaps that was all she had to offer for his friend.The days went by almost as quickly as Hermione's lived up to them. It never made much sense for a Death Eater to become a spy. Truthfully, she was surprised to learn that the Order was unable to track her because the Death Eaters were too focused on keeping her from the Dark Lord's touch. Maybe the Resistance wasn't so stupid and couldn't figure out a way to track her. It was a wonder that she hadn't been killed by a Death Eater in the middle of the Dark Lord's gruelling regime. Maybe she was saved from being a tracker by her husband, Antonin. Maybe he was just a loyal follower who didn't want to be tied down like so many Death Eaters.The last day of Azkaban was the day that the Dark Lord was executed. That was the day when the rest of the Dark Lord's followers were finally put to death, and the day when he finally returned. The day when the Dark Lord was finally free, when he was just a baby and the only person he ever loved. That day when he finally came back in full power.That day when his body finally belongs to me. 

 Hermione was sitting in the dining room of Malfoy Manor, her mind already set on her breakfast. She had just finished eating when she heard the rustling of the wind. She was in the middle of thinking of something and walked over to the fireplace, close enough to notice the silvery flames shimmering in the light. She turned on her heel and headed for the stairwell. She needed to explore the castle as much as possible. 

 It was an unannounced house in the middle of the woods. Hermione knew that it was dangerous to wander down the path, but she needed to be careful. One knock on the door only made her jump. She opened the door, but stopped when a figure walked in. 

 "My Lord, my bride," she greeted. 

 "Short," he answered calmly.

"I’m a guest in need of a bride. I had to bring you some gifts." 

 Hermione felt a rush of surprise. She’d almost asked for gifts, but this was the first gift she’d received."It’s a surprise, Granger." Auror interrogations were getting more frequent now that the Dark Lord was no longer in public life."It’s not a surprise at all, Auror." Diggle agreed.

"And I can’t say I’m surprised it’s gotten that far... "

"It’s not a surprise, Granger. You’re only nineteen." Luna placed her arms around the Auror’s middle.

"I’m quite a bit older than you, and I’ve never seen a Malfoy before."

"Your father is a spy, you know?" Draco asked incredulously.Hermione frowned. He wouldn’t be the type to be this easily fooled."What’s your name?" she asked softly."Hermione Granger," he answered.

"Poppy."

"Oh, my dear, you don’t understand," she said, her voice coming out between the two.

"Draco Malfoy."

"Oh, my dear," his eyes went wide.

"What am I called then?"

"He wanted you to be a spy. He wanted to make sure that the Order wouldn’t betray you.
