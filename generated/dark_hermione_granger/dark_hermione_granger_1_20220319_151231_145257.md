Bellatrix Lestrange's eyes looked deep into her own.



"I think my father is right. I'm fairly certain that I need to help you, little witch. You're going to need that comfort."



The blonde nodded as if she were a child, and Hermione knew that she was. Her eyes, however, went wide and she stood there, blinking rapidly, as if she wanted to remain here.



"I know, love. I'll see you soon."



She gave a slow smile as she left the room, leaving Hermione alone in the living room. She looked up at Draco, who could have sworn she saw him enter the room but instead, she froze.



He went through the fireplace, looking at her with a pale face, eyes tint red.

"I understand," she said quietly.

"I’ve been waiting for you for so long... " she said with a slight smile.They walked into a small room on the second floor. There were sofa cushions behind them and a chair behind them. Hermione sat down on a wooden bench, leaning against the window. She looked around and found that there were three people sitting there, on either side of her.

"If you could stay, we could talk." A voice from the other side of the door asked."I’ve been wanting to talk to you for months now," she said.

"I understand your wanting to talk to you, but I don’t think I’ve ever been able to find a reason for you to be so distant and secretive in public."Hermione’s jaw was clenched. The perfect storm of emotions had hit her. She wanted to scream, to cry, to even cry with pride. But this time she wanted her emotions out in the open, in front of everyone. She wanted to scream, to cry, to even be upset about it. The more she cried, the more her head hurt, and the more she felt like she was in a box. She wanted to cry, to get up, to eat, to take care of herself. But her nose and ears were too small to carry her."I was so lonely. I was so lost." She was crying, her head throbbed in her palms, eyes were black and her face looked so small... "I tried everything." He kissed her forehead, tears filling his eyes and she felt so sad.

"But I couldn’t. It was so lonely. I couldn’t bear it. I couldn’t." He stood up hastily.

"I’m sorry, I couldn’t bear it. Please, I’ll leave for an hour."Hermione looked at him.

"I’m sorry, I... " She cried, her tears flowing down her cheeks.

" was so lost in my own life, and I was so scared, I was so alone and scared. I was so so...  I really needed to see this... " She whispered.Hermione felt her heart skip a beat. She had no idea what to say, or if she would say anything. But she couldn’t help but notice that her tears were falling slowly and fast. She slowly sobbed into her hands, and breathed deeply, knowing that this was going to happen. She lifted her head and looked at Draco."Hermione," Draco said softly as he watched the two of them together.They walked back to the Manor together and Hermione hugged him. She told him everything she’d been through, even the fact that Malfoy was the best Dark Lord and most trusted of all.

"You’re all so beautiful," she said.

"I’ve never seen you like this." He laughed.

"I love you, my dear," she said softly.

"I love you too."They walked to the dining room and took their places on the couch. Her parents, news editors, and Malfoy’s publicist flew in before Hermione could ask what he was talking about.

"Well, as a thank-you," he told them.

"I’m Hermione Granger, my Mother’s only child," he said "I spent many a summer with you and your father. Nott Manor is a lovely place, but the house-elves don’t like to live in the middle of the village."

"My father is a terrible man," Draco added as he tried to contain his laughter.

"He kept me from escaping from his house when I was a child," he went on.

"He wanted to put a curse on my bed, because he didn’t want to be a father. He was so delighted when I was in Hogwarts that he even gave me a matching dressing gown. He even stole my hair for a hairpin dance!"

"That is true! That was your mother!" he roars and pulls out his wand to cut the blond hair.

"You hairpin dance with Scabbers and got it?" they laugh and walk towards their room.

"You look good," he points to a small table, which is covered in green, silver and yellow flowers.

"You should be happy that you’re not wearing anything that looks like that to your bed."

"That is an amazing idea!" he mockingly smiles.

"I really hope that you don’t mind that you’re wearing anything, Draco," he laughs.

"You should have never been allowed to wear something like that she laughs.

"It’s so cool to be naked in the sun, looking just like you already do." Everyone turns to see what they’ve been hiding. Lucius drops the bags in the sink and walks out of the room. He walks past us, his hands shifting to the pockets of his trousers. He holds up his notebook and takes a swig of whiskey. He takes a sip and a cough leaves his lips. I stare at the map, waiting for the words to arrive, but none come. He doesn’t even look up from his whiskey. I don’t know what is going on, but the sudden change in the atmosphere feels like a powerful rush to the edge of the ocean, unmoving him from all but the darkest corners of his soul.



"You’re right, but what if I don’t want to follow tradition?" Draco asks, his eyes flicking to Harry.



"I don’t know what I want to do, but what if I change my mind?" Harry asks softly.



"I’ll have to, but you’ll never change it. You’ll always choose a different path."



"You’ll never change anything, Granger."



"But I do. You can’t, you won’t. But you have to." The door slammed shut as Hermione took in the scene."What the fuck did they do to me?" He was laughing, but not so loud that it scared the shit out of him.She caught the look of horror on his face."Don’t look at me like that, Granger. I don’t care." He scoffed."You’re right, I nodded, but you didn’t." She turned around to face him and smirked."You didn’t. I did not." She said, looking to the side."No one ever ever said that it was you. "No one’s ever said that it was someone else’s"Draco said, "It’s not."

"It can’t be. Not yet."

"It’s not a long time yet."

"It’s not a long time yet."

"Right, we’re going for it."

"You’re going for it?"

"You’re going for it?"

"What? You’re going for it?"Draco’s eyes went wide with shock.

"I’m not going to lie, he said, but actually it was good of me to not lie." He paused so he could see the end of the line of arrows.

"I’ll tell her."



"You’ll tell her?" Hermione asked.



Draco nodded hesitantly.

"Yes."



"You’ll tell her," Hermione said.



"And you’ll tell her?"



"Yes."

Draco stared at Hermione for a few moments before he said, "I’ll tell her." smiled at him and stepped back, looking into his eyes, her face turning grey. She didn’t have any tears at all, didn’t say anything to him, just wrapped around a large hand."You’re going to show me your love, Hermione Granger."

"I’m going to?" Hermione asked in a soft tone."Of course, Hermione Granger." He smiled at her."I’ve been wanting to say something, but I can’t."

"You’re going to love me." She bit her lip."I mean... " She looked at him and he looked back at her with the same smirk, but a rare look of panic in his eyes that made her hurt.

"I’m a young girl, I don’t know how to act like this, but I know what I’m capable of."A look of devastation came from Hermione’s mouth. This was one of those situations where she didn’t know what to do, and so she went straight for it. She could’ve tried to get Draco to stop using the Imperius, but if he’d just been quiet, he’d have just killed her."What if he’s lying to me?" She asked.

"I don’t think he’s lying right now. I’m not sure if he even knows he’s lying."His eyes darted over her for a moment, then he turned his gaze back on her.

"No, he’s not lying. I just think that he wishes to get us out of the room."

"Okay," Hermione said stubbornly.

"I’m just worried about him."

"You’re the best person for not attacking me?" he asked, waving his arm.

"I just think that he’s lying to me."Hermione scoffed.

"I’ not lying."She was right. There was absolutely no way in hell that Draco would’ve been lying about her being concerned about him. He was innocent, and it was his fault. No one else in the Manor was in as good of shape as he was. It was just an accident. He’d never lie to her about her being in such a rush. If he’d been lying, then she would’ve just told him again. No, Draco would have been completely innocent, and wouldn’t have told her at all. He would’ve been happier for it to have been an accident."I’d say it’s not like I’ going to be walking around doing nothing for another week."

"You are right about that. You can’t just drag me back in here and expect me to be happy."

"I might as well go have a drink than worry about what happened to me." Hermione cut in, the steam from her nose making her cheeks turn pink.She was left with only one choice. She could either stay in the room and wait for the potion or she could go home. She took her night position at the table and sat down, waiting for it to boil. Hermione watched her go from drunk to angry and then back to a stupider mood when she felt the urge to go home. She wasn even sure how much time she was going to have to leave. One more thing to worry about.



It was best to start from the beginning. Hermione didn’t want to be stuck in the middle of the woods for another day. She didn’t have time for petty chores. She needed to break the family out of their gloomy, self-appointed positions. It wasn’t the first time she imagined what would happen to her if Loki were to end up having to constantly return to the old Jotunheim. She wasn’t sure how long she would need to live there, but she needed to at least have some peace. She didn’t want to be alone.



Make a wish, Draco. I’m done with my vows.



"I’m done with my vows? What? Why?", he asked in hushed whisper. Hermione couldn’t answer. This was his world. This was his world, and he’d always been faithful. So what? Why did he want to be left alone?"I don’t know. You’re a virgin, Granger,", he corrected, running his fingers through his hair.

"I’ve never even tried to be a virgin."

"You’ve been a virgin for years, Granger.", she corrected, feeling the same way as she always did.

"You’re a virgin."Hermione’s eyes widened in shock.

"Ooh, so that’s a Slytherin prediction!", she laughed.

"I’m surprised it didn’t work out like this."

"I’m not, Granger," she said, biting her lip.

"I’m sure I haven’t figured out a way to say it."

"You’ll never guess," she added in a whisper.

"It’s just a Gryffindor one, and you’re talking about purebloods, not Slytherins," he said.

"That’s the whole point. I’m not used to anyone making me uncomfortable."Hermione nodded, and felt a small bit of pride.

"I’m not."Narcissa was frowning.

"If you really want to be comfortable, don’t call me that."

"I want to be known as the sweetest, most caring, and most honest witch in the entire school," Blaise said.

"You called me that in class. And you said I was."Hermione’s eyes went wide.

"It’s not that I don want to share this with you, Granger."

"I didn’t mean it that way." Ginny scoffed.

"You’re right, I’m glad you’ve decided to go out and buy me this dress."

"And you deserve it." Ginny said with a grin.

"I’ve seen you wear it before and I can’t believe you’re even thinking of buying it. You’re the first one to wear this on such a big screen."Hermione moved to stand before her.

"I’ve been waiting for this dress."

"Gin, you two are so weird." The brunette turned away, avoiding the red and gold eyes.

"I’m sorry, but I’ve never really wanted anything before."

"You’re right," Hermione said, rolling her eyes.

"I’m tired of being a stranger in the world."

"Well, I’ll do it," Ginny said silkily.

"I’m sure you’re all still hungry."She grabbed her bag and changed into her dress robes. Hermione wore a dark purple dress with a deep plum color that matched the peach skin, the deep red and the golden necklace around her neck. Hermione looked elegant in the dress and casual robes. She was dressed in a black short sleeved and black horned dress with a white bow tie and a dark green bow tie. She looked wonderful, and the dress was so soft that she barely felt the wind when she was dressed. The dress was done in a three color color gown with a dark green dress, a dark green dress with dark green bows and a dark green dress with gold trim. Hermione looked very elegant and in her hand was an old silver corset dress with a white belt. The dress was finished in a black dark green dress, with black trim and a white bow tie. Hermione looked so elegant and elegant that it took the breath out of her, the last dress was the one she wore while she was on the run. She didn’t actually know what to wear. The only thing she knew that wasn’t so obvious was her pale skin that was painted so dark by the sunlight. She was dressed in her typical Slytherin dress, her hair was pulled back, her jewelry was wrapped around her shoulders. The only thing she didn’t know was how much she would need to buy to get out of her current state. It was going to be a long day. She felt tired after so many days of sleep.The first thing that she noticed when she entered the dungeon was the lack of a bed. She opened her chest and found a small wooden one. It was a wooden cupboard. Hermione couldn't do much but sit there and listen closely."You're not making any sense." She whispered."No, darling, I'm not." He nodded, already moving closer.

"I'm not even sure if you're even aware of this, are you?" She asked, staring at him.

"If you ever wanted to come and visit me again, you would've asked me."He nodded, pulling the cupboard back around himself and laying his head back on the edge of the bed. Hermione didn't know if he was aware of this, but she'd never felt more comfortable around him like this.
