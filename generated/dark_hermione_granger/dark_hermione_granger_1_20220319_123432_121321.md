Hermione Granger dropped down to the snowy ground, surprised, at the sight of herself in the mirror. Her hair was pulled back in a ponytail and her lips, rather than slightly parted, were the same as her usual lips. Her pale, freckled face made Hermione laugh out loud. She looked very young, and beautiful. Hermione smiled, and it was like the sun was shining through her curls.The smile was so small, Hermione thought with a smile that was very reminiscent of the night she lost her parents. She smiled as she saw the pale skin in her eyes, and the pale muscle of her hands, the soft strokes of her lips. She felt so alive, like all happiness was made possible by the warmth and love. Her eyes were youthful, and it was easy to see her in them. She was the sort of girl who knew how to play the game."Not much, I'm afraid. The fire is always strong in the garden, though it is not very strong."

"Love, now, Hermione."He smiled at her, and she was taken aback. She wasn't used to him smiling at her, but he did. There was a time when they were the only people in the world who truly felt the romance. What was wrong with her now? Was her heart broken? She couldn't understand the man."What will you be eating for breakfast?"

"I'm afraid I don't understand why you're here. I've been so hungry, but I was worried... "

"You've just never eaten in the kitchen before, haven't you? You're the only one who doesn't take food from strangers. I knew that you were dreading a Saturday morning babbling away in the kitchen. Why did you come back to the house? I never thought you'd be so concerned for you, Severus. But how many times did you stop the person who was asking you for money?"

"I never, um, I was asking for money...  I just...  I wanted to see if you would like to eat for a few hours."It was a lie. The truth. She couldn't eat for a few hours without screaming at him. It was easier for him to be honest and she was more aware of his feelings than he was a human being. He was aware of who he was and what he was trying to do. She was afraid to let him go without a fight. That was the most important thing that he could do. She wasn't sure if she could handle it. It was his entire life and he was dangerous. He was a danger to everyone else.Just as she was about to ask again why he was keeping such a large amount of secret, Hermione stopped herself. It was a strange feeling, one she hadn't experienced in a very long time. He was not a person she could allow herself to be attracted to. Not in all of the mirrors. They were the same people. Their lives were inextinguishable in her mind. It was a strange feeling to have someone else think so clearly. It wasn't as if anyone else had done it before. She wondered if Antonin had ever done it before. What other explanation could possibly be put forth in which case they were just jealous of the fact that he was an equally jealous man."I think it's time for dinner, Hermione."He smiled, but didn't say a word. She knew that she was going to be a guest for no reason. Everything was just a misunderstanding. Part of her was in the other half happy that Antonin had a better idea what was happening so that she didn't have to worry about her husband's reaction. The awkward silence that followed was a relief to her. She didn't have the energy to deal with anyone who could do her harm. As much as she might have tried to resist the temptation, she didn't like being caught in the middle of a fight. Every time she turned on her heel to face a rival with a different agenda, she would regret it."I wouldn't want to hurt anyone, but you know, Theodore, I don't think it's fair to try to harm you."

"You're right. I could have asked for a bigger fight. I was just going to lose you."The older woman's eyes narrowed at the reminder of what she once said to her before she disappeared down the corridor. Hermione didn't know her next words. It was almost as if she was suffocating in her own shadow. Her husband held her in his arms gently guiding her to stand up and begin to crawl to the sofa in the living room.

"You scared me, Hermione, even when I was just a child."She didn't like the way he spoke of their "childhood anxiety." Instinct told her to run, to find somewhere new and safe to live.

"And you did."

"I always thought that I was a little scary growing up." He leaned down, removed his arm from hers, and kissed her tenderly.

"In all of the years that I've known you, I have never once thought you that scary."She shivered at the ache that had been there all along, but she was overcome by his gentle touch. It was like sharing a bottle of Fire knowing that it was his, as he took a swig of the potion, showed his teeth, and kissed them, and it was like everything was going well again. 

 "So what were you thinking, Draco? Why are you here?" Blaise asked, surprised by the revelation. 

 "We need to go to the Manor," Draco said in a tone that was almost a challenge. 

 "Why?" Blaise asked. 

 "I can’t," Draco said.

"I’m here, so why do you have to-" 

 "You know," Blaise chuckled.

"It’s really hard to believe that someone like Pansy Parkinson would actually care about me. I would’ve never guessed." He mumbled, and I knew what he was talking about.

"Blaise," Theo kept saying, his eyes going wide as he felt the electricity crack through his body.

"I- I mean... " he trailed off.

"I don’t think I’ll ever get used to her," Theo said in a tone that made it clear that he was about to say something that made Pansy look like an old mother.

"I mean... " he trailed off.

"I think I would’ve been happier if you’d just told me your poetry and not told me anything about you and your husband and he’s a weirdo." The words choked his throat and he let out a breath.

"I want to talk about you." He asked after a few moments.

"How do you feel about me?" He asked in a whisper.

"I’ve always been a prick. Couldn’t even tell me," he said, glaring at his ruined lips.

"I’m not one of your pussies." His eyes slid to the side of Hermione’s and he let out an inhale.

"I’m doing fine," he said as he looked over his wife and her baby.

"I’ll be back soon." Hermione smiled and looked over the rest of the kids, but she could hear the worries behind it. She was going to go, hopefully, but she knew that her time was finite. 

 A few days later, Hermione found herself sitting at the breakfast table with Gwyneira and her friends. They were sitting in their usual place, though their seats were both empty. Pansy was sitting next to Gwyneira, and Angelina was sitting next to Hermione. Both were smiling and talking excitedly about their new "challenge" to the Sorting Hat.

"Last chance to submit your answers to our different sorting tables!" Professor Prince encouraged them all.

"You may start on the first page!"Harry nodded in agreement and proceeded to the new tables.

"You may begin on the first page, and choose your answer from the following table: Ancient Books, Ancient Artifacts, Ancient Artifacts that Remains Unmarked, Ancient Artifacts that Require Gilderoy Lockhart" Harry decided to start with the books he knew were the most likely answers and he searched the table for the one he thought would be the most likely. He ended up looking for something in particular: a book of wandless magic, a book of metamorphmag a book of summoning and a book of the Old Ways. She was obsessed. Just like Draco and Narcissa, she regularly visited the library to learn more magic. In her spare time, she also spent a lot of time playing portkeys with the wizards."I’m obsessed with the Old Ways," Narcissa said in a low voice, giving her a wince.

"I can’t imagine I’m the only one who’s obsessed."

"I’m not sure," Hermione said, "I’ve been studying for nearly two years."

"What? Okay, let’s go find the book store. Do you have any idea what this store is for?"Daphne nodded, sitting down.

"I have a lot of books for every subject, so I thought I might as well order them all from this store."

"Are you sure about that?" Hermione asked."Not sure yet. I’ll ask, but right now, it’s just an idea." Daphne sighed. Hermione just smiled and said, "Fine. I’ll let you show it to her."Hermione looked at the shelves, and knew that there were books about potion making. She carefully looked through the shelves, and the selection of books was not overwhelming. She knew that she would find it hard to bear, but she was a Gryffindor and had the right to fetch books she wasn't allowed to get. If she was to enjoy the library, she had to be smart about it. Not everyone could make it to the end of the day without spending a single bite. She had to be able to look forward to the end. 

 Walking into the library was a struggle. No doubt the shelves were overrun with empty books and the students were dismissed to their rooms. Hermione was grateful that they wanted to go into her study, but she didn't have such a large head for it. There were too many possibilities. 

 It was a cold night, a cold night, and the wind was beautiful.Each morning after dinner, she would sit in the Great Hall, in the corner, and read her books from home. This was Hermione's way of trying to keep the peace, to keep her sanity, and to keep her breath going. It was a simple rule, but it worked, and Hermione was able to relax. The longer she spent in the library, the less time she had to think too much. When she was done, she would go to her room and grab some parchment for her next project. She would start on the first book, and the second on the second. She would add more books until she had enough to write a letter to Kingsley. 

 Hermione sat down next to Kingsley and you all were the first to hear the news, and I asked who is in the meeting with you." Kingsley was surprised to hear his wife's response. He would have been more than happy to have the news about her, and would be able to tell her all about what happened in the castle whilst she was asleep.

"I will have a look at it when you are finished," he promised her.

"I’ll ask for your help, Hermione." He nodded his head as his eyes lingered on the letter.

"I’ll also ask for her help in bringing the truth to the wizarding world," he continued.

"I’m sure you have heard the stories of how—" Hermione waited a moment, unsure of what to say in response.

"—I’ve heard stories of how there’s a pregnant Ursa that can’t get a spell together, and how her parents got together and had a miscarriage. But none of those have been shared with me, and none of those stories have involved the girl I’ve been seeing."

"That’s not true! There’s only one Ursa that can’t get a spell together and it’s the only one that can’t be separated," Hermione pointed out.

"The only one that can’t be raised his hand.

"Now, don’t be ridiculous. I’m just saying that my little paramour is out of the picture."

"She’s not." Hermione said.

"I’m just saying that she’s not the only one out there."

"I’m just saying that her situation is quite dire," Draco pointed out.

"She’s in such bad shape that she’s barely eatable. You wouldn’t want her to go without food either, right?"

"I don’t care," Hermione said.

"I’ starving."She rose from the sofa and reached over the table and behind her, pulling out her wand.

"You’re bleeding."Hermione grabbed a syringe from her father, watching as his pale blue eyes went wide and widened."I’m not bleeding," she said.

"Just a little bit."She placed the syringe in the small of her back, letting the sharp pain of the blade ricochet around her back.

"Just one more thing before you start bleeding again."Her father didn’t look at her like she was going to faint, and she did not want to.

"If you’re still bleeding after what just happened, I’ll help." 

 The door opened and it was Hermione entering. 

 "I’m sorry, Granger." 

 "Then you’re to leave." She said, her eyes wide. 

 "I’m fine." 

 Hermione looked at him, and then she saw the body lying on the floor, in a pool of her own blood, and she felt terrible. She felt like she wasn’t a child and wouldn’t feel any other way. 

 "I’m sure you’re going to go." She said, looking back at Malfoy. @ followers are clearly not up to the task. Every single one of them are in a state of shock and fury, while the others are in a state of shock and fury. Lucius is extremely hurt, and his head is covered in a thick, red liquid."That’s bad... " Lucius drawls.

"I don’t think that’s what he’s up to. If he’s up to it, he’ll be in Azkaban, and his mother’s dead."

"Merlin, get out!" Lucius shouts.

"What happened?"

"Nothing, I just...  know. I want to go home," Draco begins.

"I’m so sorry," he responds.

"I was so worried about you, and I wanted to go home."

"I’ll go home," Draco snaps.

"No more secrets. You’re mine, you’ll have to accept that." He turns around and walks away."I’ll never tell you!" his father tears up.

"I know you, Lucius. You are a son and a daughter. I love you, Hermione. I’ll never be a part of this again."I look up as Draco walks past and I hear him ask, "What do you want to do?"

"I...  I want to study. I want to be in love with Astoria."I look at him, and he looks up. His eyes are golden, and I don’t know if I can even look up."I don’t know what you mean," I ask, trying to not look into his eyes.He looks at me and I see his fingertips on my thumb. He doesn’t look me in the eye, but I see their faces. They are the same shade of blue."Do you want to go outside?" I ask.
