Oh Harry wanted this so bad. I don't want to hurt you. I don't want to hurt you. I need you. Harry Potter? It is not like that. You are enough for me. You are not Merlin. He is not like that. He is an asshole. I need you. That is all. He is a bastard, and I need you. Don't hurt yourself, please don't hurt yourself. Please, don't hurt yourself, please don't! He is your best friend. Please Merlin, please, don't! You need me and this is the best way to go about things. I have to save you. Please, don't do anything! Please, don't! I...I...I can't, Harry. Harry Potter is dead. He's a memory. You have to get him. Please, don't. I...I can't. I can't. I'm so sorry. I can't, Harry. Please, don't...I can't...I can't...I can't...I can't...kill Tom!



"You can’t kill him!" Harry cried loudly.

"I can’t. I’ve done it before. I can’t."

"What? You’re not!" Harry cried out.

"What about your friends? What do they have to do with this?"

"I don’t have any friends to play with, that’s why they had to be out of the country for a week."

"You’re right, but it looks like they’re going to have to do a lot more than that."

"They’ve just been spending weeks hiding in their hotel room."Hydrus was surprised by the fact that it had to be true. He’d only heard of the rumors about the group’s hiding in their hotel room once or twice. It was as if the Room of Requirement was an elaborate trap set by the Malfoys. Perhaps he’d never have to hear the full truth."I’m sure they’ be glad to know he’s back from the dead," Higgs said."They’d hate him just as much as they would a Dark wizard," Pansy decided, a glimmer in her eye catching the furious Malfoy matriarch.

"He’s an absolute menace."Hydrus was inclined to agree. He was sure that Pansy would be a perfect Dark Lord for a challenge like that. But with a presumed-unveiled Dark mark, he couldn’t be sure. He also didn’t want to be in a position where he had to prove he was worthy of being the Dark Lord. Even if he did manage to prove himself worthy, he hadn't been the most effective leader that the Dark Lord had. He was simply too unpredictable."I'm going to leave the country for a few days."It was the only explanation why she didn't want to go back to Hogsmeade. Maybe she was a little too optimistic that the Dark Lord wouldn't come searching for her to return there. If he didn't fear they would be betraying her to his enemies, maybe they would just find her again. She thought about it. If the Dark Lord discovered she'd been in Rodolphus' house, they would be in trouble. Rodolphus wouldn't be the only one to discover. She didn't want to risk the possibility that he would find her. What had he been so quick to say when she first arrived that made her think he was a spy? At least he didn't say anything that made her believe he'd been in contact with Rodolphus. He was a master manipulator, one who had mastered the art of making people suffer."You're not going to tell me what he did to you? We've been in the same house, you know?"

"Yes, we've been in the same room together."

"You're absolutely right, Granger. That was never his intention. He just wanted to hurt me. He doesn't like hurting me in any way that is physical. He was always in the habit of hurting himself in a fight. That's not why he brought me here, he wants to punish me for what I did. I need to learn to not let that happen."His eyes narrowed, but they remained focused on Draco's face. He was standing on the edge of the sofa in the kitchen. Hermione held her hand up, ready to wade through the thick blanket when her eyes slid to the noise that followed."Why do you always start fights in the middle of the night? Your father is dead and I can't afford to keep him in the middle of the night." She turned her head away from him."He's not the only one you know the names of."

"Yes, he is. I'm going to leave you here." She stopped him with a wave of her hand, hoping he would stop her from making it worse.

"Do you know if her husband is alive?" he asked.

"He’s been hiding from me for weeks." the girl nodded, her hands curled up to show her hands.

"Come on, let’s go outside." Draco patted her on the top of her head.

"Don’t you dare come alone. We’re running late." He winked at her.

"We’ll stay until they’re both ready." Draco leaned back, his hands on her shoulders.

"What should I do?" Hermione leaned back, her eyes narrowed.

"I’m not sure. I’m sorry for telling you that."

"I’m sorry for everything that I’ve been through." Hermione let out a breath, her heart beat rapidly.

"Everything that I’ve been through, I’m sure, but I’m safe. I’m not dying, I’m alive," she admitted.

"I’m not dying." She looked at Theo.

"What do you mean? What should I do?" Theo’s eyes darted down to the floor, and he quickly looked back.

"I’m sure that’s the first thing that come to your mind."I looked around the room, my eyes met his.

"I’ve been staring at my parents since I saw you two." He looked at me, puzzled."What?" I asked confused.

"What’s the platform for us?"He looked at the platform.

"This is a replica of the platform that houses the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It’s missing a few of the Hogwarts’ bells and whistles as well as the stone statue of an owl."We moved forward.

"This is the place, the reason for your visit."

"Why do you need to come here?" Hermione wanted to know."Because I want to see you." He said, her eyes stayed on his.Hermione nodded, without a second thought, and she went back to the dining room. It was decorated with red roses, and Draco was sitting across the table from her."I’ll like to see you for dinner tonight." He said.Hermione looked up. She carefully put on her slippers and walked out of the room. She took her cloak off and walked to the dining room. She turned on her side and walked to the middle of the room. She walked into the room and found Draco sitting on his bed. She sat down on the edge, not sure if she should stand or lay down. Draco leaned onto her side, tasting the scent of it.

"What do you want, dear."

"I'm sorry. I don't understand why he would want to stay here or not."

"Why would you want to stay here?"

"Why are you here?"

"I wanted to talk to you. I'd better go, Gin."

"Nothing is going to happen between us here. You're not going anywhere, you know."She sighed, settling back into the chair.

"If I don't tell you anything, if I don't tell you anything, I won't be able to stay. You've been my home for over a year. You didn't come here to hurt me. I know who you are, but I won't tell you everything."His eyes widened in surprise when Hermione pulled closed the door in her face.

"I'm sorry." She stepped aside, not sure if she could trust herself.

"I'm sorry for all of the trouble that I went through with spying on you. I'm sorry for the end of our relationship."

"Then what are you going to do?"

"I don't know, I'm not sure. That's my life now. I can't live alone."

"No, you're not living alone. At least not for the foreseeable future."She didn't want to say more than that. She felt different than she ever had before. It was a comfortable feeling, one that she couldn't ignore She didn't see how it was still a valid reason to flee. She needed to find someone else.



Hermione knew that once she returned to Hogsmeade, that she would be busy. Every day that she stayed in the cottage was a waste of time. She needed to plan her next steps. The next time she did something she would be reckless and reckless and overjoyed at the same time. It was wrong to rush into something that was not a possibility. She had to get out of the safe house before she had to run. Making that decision could lead to regrets.Draco Malfoy had been in her room for over a month. He was the one who told her about her plan. She'd had to go along."It's a double suicide. The only one who's been able to save her is you, correct? And you're the one who told me about it."

"Yes, well, I'm not sure that I want to hear it. But I can't do that."

"Well, I can."

"You know what I'm going to do, Harry. I think you're going to help me. The only other Death Eaters that have helped me are You-Know-Who and Voldemort. You know that? I know. I used to do the same, but I couldn't because of that."

"I know. But you're the only one who has. I don't want to know, so just tell me and I'll tell you."



Hermione felt a rush of magic when she felt Draco's wand touch her forehead, knocking her out cold. She tried to hold back a sob, but it was the only way out.



"Don't ruin it, Granger. Don't do this to me."



Hermione rolled onto her back, trying to hold her head up. It was too close.



"You're both not worth it, Granger." Draco's wand was in her hand, but he wasn't using it in any violence.



She sat up again, almost shrieking with fright. Hermione tried to keep her face neutral, but was unable. Tears were running down her cheeks. She couldn't stay silent anymore.

 you okay? Did you hurt her?" Hermione's voice was heavy with tears."No, I didn't." The tears were running down her cheeks and she was going dark. She was getting dark. She was getting dark. She was getting dark. She was getting dark. She was getting dark. She was getting dark. Her mind was still muddled with thoughts of the past weeks. Hermione's eyes held only the vague memory of her own nightmare. The night was raised in the middle of the night. It was warm in the middle of the night. It was warm in the middle of the whole castle. The night before, it was warm in the middle of the ballroom. It was all in the past week. The only changes were in the dresser and the black shirt. Otherwise, the dress was a very comfortable piece. The more I wear it, the more I am glad that I bought it for you. I will always wear this with pride. The only change it has is the black and silver buttons. I will always wear this. I am not sure how I even got this dress, I can only remember that it was supposed to be my own creation. I had to get it made myself, but I pulled the strings out of it before I asked. It is not a gift, I just wanted to show you. The first time you ever wear it I wanted you as a present. This one time I wanted to invite you. Nobody will ever understand how useful or safe we were, and I was a fool to think that we could do anything."The rest of the meal was spent in silence. That night Hermione shook her head. There was no need to be so open. Her curiosity was overpowering her weakness, and she waited. The next morning the table was empty. Just a simple bed and a small table. She didn't want to risk the guests finding it too comfortable. Not that she minded. She wasn't going to be in the same room as them."Hermione?" She asked the front door of the kitchen. No one would ever open it. Not even a ghost would be able to. She would just have to find her way there.There was a moment of silence as my parents chatted in the kitchen, and the silence grew long enough for them to ask the same question. Was my dad literally making me drink water? As I got up and took my seat in the kitchen, I realized I was missing my magic-bonded. I'll have a letter ready!As I took a seat in the kitchen, I heard the rustling behind me. I have to go back to the library! My parents were alone in the library while my mother was reading and making tea. I can't believe what I'm doing there!



I have to go back to the library!



The room was silent as they read and the tea was done. Hermione took a step backwards, and told them to get out of here.

"You know, I don't want them here."



"You need to go get a haircut, make sure that they'll eat their own food, and then go get a new pair of underwear." Hermione said, leading her into the bathroom.

"I didn't want to have to use magic to get my hair done."

"I was going to ask you to do this, but I'm not going to 'do' it." Draco said, his voice cold and angry.

"You're taking that away from me." She looked at him, then at him.

"Don't you think he was just looking for some kind of favor to you?" Hermione nodded, as she got up from the table.

"I'm here for you. Hermione, are you okay?"

"I'm fine, I'm just-" my eyes went to the contact and I looked down at the dark circles under my eyes.

"I shouldn't have to do this to you, just look at me." My eyes went back to the letter, and I was surprised at how beautiful and deep-eyed I was. I wrote the note to her, all because I wanted her to feel the same way I felt, and I wanted her to-"

"-I knew what you were doing back then, Granger. I kept up with your movements, even sent her a letter asking her to apologize." Narcissa's eyes went to the letter but the words went out of her mouth.

"Sorry for my outburst, I was out of practice with no words left." The silence was filled with tension, and Hermione didn't have to worry about it. She just had to stare into the fire and be angry. Of course, she didn't have the time to deal with the impending wrath of a fire breathing (or not) and was already seated when the Dark Lord entered the room. He smiled at her, and she could tell he was upset."What are you doing here?" She asked, not expecting this conversation to take place.

"You're being a secretive bastard." He asked."Yeah, you're the spy, I guess." She said, her words echoing off the parchment "I'll be there."The next day, they got ready to leave for the living room, but Hermione was too exhausted to go there. She stayed until dinner, then climbed in bed. She found the room was empty, but the room was empty too. She walked into the kitchen and took a cup of tea. Before going to sleep, she rolled up the sleeves of her dress, then slipped it on. The charm was spot on, and it had a bracelet on it that would let her know she was awake. Her eyelashes were still a little too close to her own, and she had her curls in the bun.
