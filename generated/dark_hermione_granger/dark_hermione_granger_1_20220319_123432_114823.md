Dear Father and Mother he wrote a letter to my son from the bottom of his heart. I understand that this letter is not meant as a criticism of the letter, but I want to start this letter by asking you to understand why you are reading the letter. I know that you are well and truly blessed, love. I can also see that most of you are looking forward to the day that you will drop all pretenses of being a saint and become a true Pureblood. You, like my son, have no self-respect and so you will do everything in your power to make sure that you never get noticed. Be careful. Be safe. This is not some criticism of mine. I am here to say that I am not against Purebloods or of the Pure tradition. I don't want to hurt anyone, even if it is bad. I just want to make sure that the Purebloods have the same rights as us that do them, and that we are always welcome in our families. My family, and I will do everything in my power to ensure that everyone has their fair shot at living. I will also take care that you are placed with your family and support, and I will make sure that you will have the opportunity to start a family with me. I will be the one to rule over this world, and I will rule it from the shadows. I will protect you, and I promise to make life as difficult for you as possible. As for my daughter, I will throw her away. I didn’t give her up...  I saved her for you to have a family."Before I could say a word, the door slammed shut and a long, hot summer breeze whipped through. The warm water sucked the breath from my lungs and spasmed my muscles. I felt all sorts of things as I got dressed, and my clothes were off before I could even scream out. A man walking by the window slammed it shut and turned the lamp on. He looked around, and I could see him as I entered the room. 

 "Did you know Astoria is dating Lily?" he asked.

"You’re not the only one who thought so... " 

 didn’t look up from his book.

"What do you mean by that?" He asked sarcastically.

"Why would I be willing to be a spy for Dumbledore? I’m not sure you’re a smart enough young lady to be in a position like that." 

 "You should’ve told me last time," Luna told him.

"You and Hydrus were the first ones to go to Egypt." 

 "Ah, but they’re gone now," Hydrus said, sounding very unimpressed.

"I didn’t realize you’d tell me anything." 

 Mulciber: "I’m not sure how to explain that at this rate." She shrugs.

"Some people are just so quick to dismiss the real world."

"Maybe you’re not the only one who’s obsessed with that."

"Don’t be ridiculous," he snaps.

"You’re a Gryffindor right?" he counters, eyes getting stuck to my eyes. I can't see them, but I can smell them.

"What the hell are you doing here?" I ask, trying to get back to my writing.

"I’m not sure." He looks over at Hermione, who is staring at him.

"I’m sorry," she whispers and snaps her fingers.

"I’m sorry for everything I’ve done."

"I’m sorry for everything that I’ve put you through," he is so angry at her for getting her off.

"You have no right to be so low," she shouts, but Draco doesn’t hear her.

"I’m sorry for all the pain I’ve caused. It’s my fault, no one has ever forgiven me." He watches her anger, but doesn’t comment.

"I didn see the Dark Lord and he didn’t show," he starts.

"I didn’t see how easy it was to use him, how he would get information. I just didn’t see how easy it was to use Draco." He holds out his hand, and she opens her arm.

"There is nothing dangerous in it." She holds up her hand, and he turns back to her.

"I know." He holds up his hand again.

"I know." He holds up his other hand.

"I followed the instructions and without thinking I did. I did." As she holds up her hand, he turns around and returns the hold."I think I’ll be okay," he says, and walks out of the mirror. Draco is quick to the other side of the room, and turns around to face her."I’m sorry, Malfoy," she whispers, and pulls her hand back."Are you okay?" he asks, and turns away. Draco is standing next to her, clearly not in need of comfort."I’m fine," she smiles.

"Just a bit tired. I feel uncomfortable around you."

"You can always ask your Father, but I don’t want to talk to him," he mumbles.

"I want to go to bed." 

 I return my chair and see Professor Snape staring at me.

"He felt as if a single finger was touching you, Snape." He looks up.

"He has to have eaten something this morning." 

 I just nod and walk out of the room. I walk towards the Potions room and stand in the room.

"Professor," I hiss.

"I’m sorry. I’m sorry for sending you this message." I do the same before stepping out.

"It was not meant to be this way. I’m sorry for sending it." I do the same before him. 

 "My apologies?" he asks. 

 I frown and shake my head. 

 "I’m so sorry I didn’t see what you meant, Granger."

"You missed the letter."

"I didn’t even think to send it. I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to." I look up at him.

"But you know."

"I did."

"I was so worried about you, Hermione."

"I meant everything to you. I was so lost in my life, I didn’t see you in a lot of ways. If you want to know what I look like, you should start by explaining yourself."

"What do you look like?" Hermione wanted to know the answer.

"How do you feel?"

"I’m all the way around here, I should start off by saying that I am not the brightest witch in the entire school. I’m not even the brightest witch of my age."

"What?" Hermione asked, surprised by all of the questions she had this year.

"You think I am the brightest witch of all?" 

 Next to her, she looked at the floor. The two of them were standing up in a warm bed. Hermione was shocked to see them both standing in the middle of the room, but she didn't think the people in the dining room were all that shocked when they caught their eyes. They were all fairly insistent that they were the ones who came up with the plan, and it kept going so that they could pretend like they weren't there and pretend like they weren't there.It was an interesting way to go from being just a witness to a person being caught. She thought that maybe it was a waste of time to try and prove how much she rather enjoyed the sight of the two women. It was too hard to prove anything without feeling guilty. Hermione fell silent and stared at the two women's faces. The first one was a perfect representation of her. The second was a still image of a dream where Draco was standing next to her, still holding a chair between them. It was an image that seemed to float in the night. The third was a cat, still a picture of a rabbit, still a cat, still a cat. She bit her cheek, the second time. The fourth was a book, still a picture of a snake, still a snake, still a snake, still a snake, still a snake, still a snake. She still felt weird. The first time the book was in her hands, she looked up to see the snake sitting on a chair with a cup of tea next to it. The second time she saw him, she could only guess that it was the man she loved.When he looked up, she saw an arm draped over his shoulders. She took it in both of their shoulders and kissed him. It was a simple reminder that they were in love. She couldn't explain it. 

 "I told you, I...", Hermione trailed off, unsure what to say.

"I'm a virgin. I don't have to tell you that.", he said, placing a kiss on the top of her head. I don't have to tell you that, Hermione. I know you don't have to tell you that.

"I don't have to tell you.", she said, letting her hands glide over his shoulders. I don't have to tell him what he wanted, I feel safe knowing that he did. It's what I need, but I don't have all the answers. I look up at the feet of the stairs, but I don't want to catch my breath."You know, I feel like I'm missing out on what we can offer him. He's a Gryffindor, I know that." I look up, hoping that this conversation doesn't feel like a trap."He's not a student, is he?"

"Not at all. He's a professor, and I have the utmost discretion with how I wish to teach the younglings. He'll-" she was cut off by the sound of a door opening, "-he wants you for a future we never shared." Pansy nods."I don't know what happened, but she's already made the decision to be with Draco. It's a long journey, but she's going to be the strong one."Her eyes held tears. Hermione couldn't stop herself from gushing. She just needed a few moments to calm down. She needed rest."You and Harry are right. It's not a good idea. That's not what I want." She felt a tear roll down her face.

"I need to talk to her, and I need to make sure she's okay. She's not a bad person, so it's really important that she's in the right place. And I'm a friend. I know she's smart and I trust her. But I don't know if she knows how to prove herself. Maybe she's a witch, or an animagus." 

 Hermione sat across to the fireplace, her fingers twitching to show her arm length. She didn't quite know exactly where her arm was, only that it was wrapped around her middle and was wrapped around her shoulder. It didn't feel right. Something was off. She couldn't immediately explain it, but she felt her eyes wander up to the inner corner of her brain. There was something about it and it was unnerving. She opened her eyes, trying to focus on anything but the strange feeling. It was a horrible warmth. She remembered the smell, but it was gone in a matter of moments. The icy cold of the only real bath Hermione ever experienced was gone once more. She set her cup down on the table and reached for her wand. The icy water hit her in the chest, leaving a trail of cold water down her chest. She felt her heartbeat slow down. Her head hit the table, which was leaning on its own legs. She took a breath, trying to calm her thoughts. She didn’t like this world. She didn’t want to create another one. It was too dangerous. She took a step towards the shower, wanting to look into the healing wounds on her hands. She didn’t like the new life she was in. It was all too familiar. She needed to stick close to him. She really should change how she felt about him.He stood up from the sofa he'd been so desperately clinging to, his head hung low and his shoulders sagging.

"Tell me what you think, little raven. I want to see how you handle the new you, how you feel about the new you, how you feel about the new you." Hermione's eyes flew from his shoulders to the rich purple veins that ran through his arms. As if he'd seen her stare into her shoulder. She would tell him nothing, but if she didn't tell him something, he would know instantly. He'd been so broken, so lost, that when he met her, he was so lost and cold. He had no idea how to make friends. When she told him that she was pregnant with Draco's child he had gone completely mad."We couldn't hold the family in our hands anymore. Not with all of the drama that was brewing inside our heads."

"We could move on."

"We loved you more than we could ever admit to ourselves. We'll never get used to how it feels to love someone that way again. I'm not sure how you're able to love someone that way, but you'll always be our friend."The last words that were whispered in Hermione's ear before she ran away were true. She was able to keep a steady stream of her thoughts even when they were constantly on the move. She didn't even have to worry about the time she was forced to stay in her room in the guest room or her own room in the living room. She was safe. She couldn't imagine what was happening outside their bedroom window. 

 If the Resistance wanted her dead, they had to kill her. Hermione didn't care if they had to kill her. She was doing their job, as much as they could. Forcing herself out of the house, she waited for the front door to slam shut. She was out of her mind. She was too consumed by her fear to even notice the crack in the glass. She was too drunk. It wasn't just the potion that made her feel so high. The most sober person in their world, she knew that. She'd known the man. He wanted her to die. He was a good man. He always liked control. She could see his eyes, the gentleness in them, the sapphire eyes, the way he carried himself like a strong, strong woman, his hands on his hips, the way he spoke to her, the way they touched, the way he treated her. He was beautiful, the way he looked at her, the way he made no mistake about what she deserved. She was a beauty, a dark witch.She was so filled with dread and excitement that she didn't see anyone, even their daughter, for a long time. That was how the Dark Lord got to know her. He knew all of the secrets of her life and that she was the reason why the Ministry was so unfair to her. She wanted to know all the facts, but he was too interested in the politics and intrigue of the Wizengamot to appreciate her reading them. He was a natural at hiding his feelings, but not by blood, she knew that. And yet, he was so much more than her wife, he was a person, and she felt that. Since she and her husband were no longer bound by an unbreakable vow that they would never touch each other, she knew that she had to follow his example.Hermione pushed the notebook she had laying on the desk back into the small of her back. She didn't even have time to think about the lesson.
