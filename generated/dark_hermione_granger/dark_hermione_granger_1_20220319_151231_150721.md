The letter from Hogwarts arrived in mid-September. I'm going to be honest. I was worried about you all the last few months. I wasn't sure what to do with myself. I wanted to return home but I couldn't because of the war. I was worried about my family and the war. I don't know how to explain this, but I did everything in my power to convince Kingsley to give me a pardon and that right after the war I was suddenly so angry that I didn't even notice it. I was begging him to let me go, I was so angry. I couldn't bear it, I had to admit, I didn't know what to do. I couldn't even comprehend how much I had changed. I couldn't bear to admit it, Severus but I was trying to’ve been of a different mind when I left Hogwarts, and my father had to send me away after a year."Draco paled.

"How did you know?"

"I’ve only just met you, Draco," Severus said without looking at him.

"I told you I was friends with you, and I thought you fancied me."He didn’t want to say anything more but Snape narrowed his eyes at him: "You told me you were friends with Lily and James, and that you wanted to hang out with me."

"I’ve heard that story before," Draco said, his eyes going distant.

"It was your father’s idea. How did you come up with that idea?"Ashley nodded.

"I’m not sure."

"Well, why do you think I’d say that?" Ashley asked, "Because it’d be fun to say, you know?"

"Well... " Draco drawled, "I suppose it’s true."

"Well, then let’s see." Ashley snickered."Yes!" Draco exclaimed."You can’t say that!" Ashley exclaimed."I suppose not!" Draco snorted."You can’t say that, then?"

"I suppose not." Ashley defended quickly."We’ll just have to find a way for you to prove it then." Draco snorted."Alright fine." Ashley protested."And you’re welcome!" Draco said in a snarky voice.Ashley snickered in surprise, but she quickly found one way she liked the least. She didn’t want Draco to find out about her presence in the library. The key was the Mirror of Erised. She had no doubt that Cedric would know about it and would let the Order know that it existed At least until Harry, Ron, and Ginny did. While Ginny didn't want to talk about it, she knew that Hermione would have been the last to tell them. For the sake of peace, she would speak of it tonight. She also couldn't allow her men to know that she'd torn their ties with Voldemort and was now their friend. She could not allow them to know that she was truly loyal to them. It was too dangerous for them to be so open with her. It was simple, yet very effective. Hermione was just as much a pawn in a complicated game as Harry and Ron were.They both knew that this was the right move for them. Hermione would keep this a secret for the sake of peace. She would not reveal it to anyone. Draco was the one who was the secret keeper, and she felt that the one person that she could trust with the knowledge of her actions."We'll do it, Granger. I'll make it look like we're a secret society."

"No, but we can't be allowed to share information as we wish. Besides, we don't have the power to turn back the tables and tell you everything that happened."The first thing she said was that she would be damned to not tell Draco that what she did was her decision and he would be able to forgive her. Hermione wasn't sure that she wanted to tell him all of the details of her actions and what she did to save the world, but she really didn't care. There was no need to be so spiteful, she just wanted to be normal. She was getting old and it was no wonder that she was facing rejection from so many people. She was already over the time period of an entire lifetime and she had to settle down with her old friend. It would not do to be like Hermione when she was in the middle of a rejection. She wouldn't have been able to accept her when everything went wrong. His touch was real, but it was better that she not put her finger on the pulse of the world.She didn't know what to do. All she knew was that she couldn't keep her hands off of Antonin. In the past, he'd been her friend. Many times over the years she'd been the only female in the family. But he was a coward. She knew that. He was a traitor. What would he do now that she knew?"No, Antonin. You're not the only one who doesn't want to kill everyone."It wasn't the first time she considered the possibility that she was as thin as that. She wanted to be as far away from him as possible. If he didn't understand the dangers that she was in, he wouldn't hesitate to kill her. As much as he might have tried to kill her, she knew that he was unpredictable. If he was able to sense that her body was in danger, he would jump at the opportunity. He would take her down, but not before he would kill her. It was all just one big game. Her last, and likely only, opportunity to be with him before they were separated was by no means a good look.The last thing he wanted to do was worry about their son. Hydrus wondered if at that moment, Merlin himself, he would ever learn. He'd been drawn to the Dark Lord for reasons that should've made little bit of difference. What would happen if he saw Draco unable to protect his friends? Would he be able to protect them? If so, what happened to Alecto and Alecto? He didn't want to know. He was the only one of them who wanted answers.In the end, there was no choice. Hermione was the only one who had the guts to tell Antonin everything. If he would've listened to her, there would've been no way to save her from the temptation. She would have to be brave enough to say anything he might say to help him escape. Her life would be easier if Antonin was just a little bit less dramatic."Why would you listen to me, Hermione?"She couldn't understand why anyone else would listen to her reasons. He knew everything and more about the man. What had he been hiding from her? Why didn't he mention anything to her? She was the one who had to be told about the Resistance. If Antonin didn't want her to hear anything, he would've told her. He was the most obedient she’d ever had, so obedient, so he would surely be the one to ask for it. Hermione had it all, the little bitch. She had the little one. And maybe she’d never want any more.



She didn’t want to have the baby. Hermione never wanted a child. She went through life with two parents, one of them loving their child and one of them hating it. They both were doomed to fail. Hermione didn’t want a child. Hermione went through life with two parents, two of them loving their child. There was no room for a child in a marriage. Hermione went through life with two parents, two of them hating their child. And they couldn’t afford to get into a fight. The man who was going to marry the woman he loved, and who clearly had a wife and a child." Pansy growled.

"It’s a pity that they didn’t have a child to look forward to." Draco nodded.

"I’m not asking why they didn’t have one of their own, but please don’t end it." Hermione squeezed her cheeks.

"There was never any child left of mine, and I was never in love with anyone, so I’m not the person for this." Pansy held the cup of tea, and Pansy went into the kitchen, where she placed the tea in a cupboard."The bathroom is way too cold." Hermione stepped out and went into the bathroom."You want to go to the bath now?" Pansy asked.Hermione stepped into the tub and walked over to the sink. She washed her hair before walking behind her. She washed her face and hair as best she could and then went to the sink again. She got dressed, but did not put on makeup. The only color that came out was peach. Hermione looked in the mirror and saw a black face. She looked beautiful, Hermione didn’t want to look like a normal girl. She brushed her hair, stealing it from her face.

"You know, you’re beautiful." She moaned.

"I don’t want to be you, but I’m sorry."

"I’m my own man. I’m your natural beauty. Your father’s natural beauty." He kissed her lips again, reaching his hand out to touch her forehead and feeling her eyes sparkle.

"I’ll keep you safe with that." She smiled and kissed him again.

"Will you... " He trailed off, his hands finding their way in her hair.

"Are you mine?" She asked in a worried tone.

"Yes. But I will not be able to keep it, let alone all of the Weasel’s," he said with a grin.

"I’ll have you in my arms when you return."



He was right. Hermione had now been forced to use the Weasel’s wand as often as she liked, and she was able to keep her eyes closed. She was amazed that he didn’t use magic to keep her eyes closed, but that didn’t mean anything if he didn’t have a wand in his hand.



"I’m yours," he said with a grin.

"I’m yours."



Herm smiled and hummed, her fingers sliding over the top of her chin and brushing against the rough skin beneath. Her arms spread around him as if she were a pillow over his shoulders, holding him close."I’m so beautiful, but my magic is dull," she said softly. She’ll have more time to show him that, maybe he’ll find it in her."I... I can’t... " she trailed off.

"I can’t... "

"How do you feel?" he asked."I feel...  fine." She nodded, letting out a sigh of relief.

"I’m just thinking about how to help."

"It’s complicated," Hermione said, a tear falling.

"I want you to know that I am here, not just for your sake;" she added.

"I wish to help you a great deal."Hermione’s eyes went wide. She was about to say something, but was stopped by a voice."It’s just that there’s a slight pained noise in the distance. Is it a baby? Is it a curse?"

"No, it’s...  It’s not a baby. It’s a curse."

"...  A child?" The Dark Lord asked, wrinkling his nose.

"That’s not exactly what I’d call it."

"I’m sorry, my Lord." He rose from the table and settled himself on the ground, his arms spread out on the side table, looking down at the baby.

"I’m sure you’ve suffered enough."

"I’m not." The Dark Lord said with a sigh.

"I might have been slightly hurt when I was giving birth to you, but I’m sure you feel much better."

"Yes, my Lord. I’ll help you with any that you need. turned to look at him. She was almost disappointed that he would choose to do this.

"There’s no need to disappoint your Lord."

"I’ll be right there with you."

"Thank you."Hermione did her best to ignore the tears that trailed down her face. She felt a slight sting at the thought of losing control. She knew that if she let it go too far she would get hurt. She had done that countless times to herself, but she just didn’t care. The only thing that mattered was the Lord’s approval. He was the one that had the power to change someone’s entire life. How could one person make it so?



"You can’t have this," Hermione said as she looked over the dead body of Dumbledore, the blood from his head, and the remnants of his hair.



A woman in black robes, carrying a black paintball gun, stood beside Dumbledore, her face and eyes covered in black, under a bright light.



Dumbledore had his hands raised and his face was covered in black, clearly he had been holding onto his memories from the night of the battle.



The woman stood and reached out to Dumbledore, but the headmaster did not move.



"You will not harm this man," Dumbledore stated plainly.



The woman waved her wand.

"Yes, Harry Potter," she said.

"I am the mother of Harry Potter." The man nodded silently.

"I was, but now that I am back, I need to step up." Dumbledore stepped forward, his hands on the man's shoulders.

"Your father is the Headmaster. He is the one who’s been in the hospital wing. I am here, on the second floor."

"It is fine. I just need to go." Dumbledore nodded.

"I’ll be back in a few hours." He walked out, leaving the other guests behind him. The door opened as quietly as he could.  they are, I believe. You know we have a similar program in the other country. I don’t want to be the only one to find out what the students here have been doing." Hermione watched Draco’s expression change as he introduced himself and Harry. She pulled out her wand and cast a simple charm. The students turned to stare at her, with an unsure look, and she pointed the wand directly at them.

"Fred’s a boy." Harry said in surprise.

"It is his name," the others said in unison.

"And Harry’s a boy." Draco said, shaking his head.

"It’s Hermione fault for ignoring the fact that the two of them are just like everyone else." Hermione shook her head.

"I don’t blame you. You made him feel like he wasn’t alone." Draco grumbled.

"Hermione should’ve told you." He said, glancing at the group of people.

"I’d have never forgiven her." Hermione said with a smirk.

"It was a pity, Draco." She said with a smirk when they were all pulled away into the fire.

"I’d have never forgiven her." Draco smiled.

"Anyway, Harry and Ron are staying here. Harry nodded as he took the two boys into his arms.

"Yeah, I’m sure they’ll be fine. I’ll be here on the 16th." He gave them a confused look.

"That’s an interesting idea." Harry nodded as he grabbed Ron’s arm for a kiss before returning to the group.



Hermione was surprised to see a sign in the sky above the castle. The sun was slowly illuminating the sky with a silvery light. It seemed that everyone was standing quite still for a few minutes. She didn’t know if it was just a coincidence that the sign was silent, or if it was the most unusual thing in the world. She didn’t think there was any way that the Ministry’s Chief Warlock would be able to listen to such a thing. She’d never heard of the Warlock being in charge of all wizarding government, so perhaps it was an oddity that he didn’t seem to know of most of the Wizengamot, though he had the ability to appear to do so. It didn’t help that Hogwarts had strict rules on wizarding government.
