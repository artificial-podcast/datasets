"I know, but I really hope you're not finding it this way."

"I'm sure it would be better if you didn't have to deal with the 'Disappointment'. It's a form of cabin fever. It's quite dangerous."

"It should work better if one's not in contact with others."

"And you're not sure you want to be in contact with another witch?"

"I'm not sure I'd be willing to trust a witch without a wand. But, I was hesitant to become one of those people. I can't remember how I got out of it all."

"You're a Gryffindor? You're a witch, Hermione. You can be that stupid as Slytherins."

"Haven't you thought about that?" Pansy asked, her eyebrows now raised in question."Not really. No, not really. I just want my friends to know I'm not that bad, and that they are important people who care about me. I'd like to get to know them, and I'd never like to be in trouble." Pansy sighed, looking at her wife in a way that said more than she meant to.

"I'd like to meet you at the Quidditch Pitch, you know. It's an event, and you're not supposed to see me."

"Poppy?" Hermione asked, her eyes going to the ceiling.

"What are you doing here Your father is a professor at the school, you are the only person with access to the school grounds. I need to know where is the person and what they are doing here."Hermione swallowed, her eyes narrowing as she tried to piece together the puzzle of what she was doing.

"Professor? What is he doing here?"

"I don't know, he is in my dorm. I am not allowed to invade his private space unless I am accompanying him to class, and I am not allowed to engage in sex with him. What are you doing here?" She asked in a hushed whisper.

"I am sorry, but I am not allowed to use the boys' dorms, and I am sure you know that. If I can find out what is going on in there, then I will be on my way. I am going to have to do a lot of questioning and questioning on everybody involved in this."

"But you won't. You are going to make me understand! What is the purpose of this? I will never be able to clear my mind without you." Draco's eyes went wide.

"I know you don't like me seeing or hearing my voice, but I am going to help you. I am going to ask you to stay with us for a week, or until we can find someplace else to live. You are going to stay here for a week, I am going to leave the Manor."

"No, I won't leave!" He backed down shaking his head, "You'll be safe there. I have no reason to keep you here any longer."

Hermione could only think of him and Blaise as the most perfect couple that she had ever laid eyes on. It had been a long time since they had been together, and she'd spent years together, after everything they'd gone through. She would never forget the first time they fucked in the library together, and it was the one time she truly believed that they had love. She was so wrong.No one was home when they returned – it was hidden carefully hidden in the Manor behind a pillar of ivy. Hermione was sure that Snape would have heard about it. She was already planning to leave for H Hermione was upset that the whole thing was not just about her soul-bonded, but about the Malfoys and their meddling in her life. With all of their emotion and anger pours out of her mind, she couldn't even imagine how much it affected her. Though it was nothing compared to the reaction she had when she was alone, she felt it more than she ever felt before. She was tired of being the person that everyone was supposed to be. It was annoying and she hated it.She wasn't sure how she managed to stay awake long after the events in her dream were put into her head. Perhaps it was the tension, or maybe it was the exhaustion that kept her up at night. Hermione tried to convince herself to not sleep for another two nights. It was much easier to fall asleep when she wasn't busy with her work.

Two days after Ginny returned to her room, Hermione found Ginny in the kitchen discussing something with her husband. Though he didn't seem to be very upset, he looked at her strangely. She couldn't believe that he was upset, but she was. How could he be so selfish that he care for her like that? He'd been so insatiable for her that he probably only cared for himself. Hermione thought that Ginny was in love with him, and she would never forgive him. It was what she deserved.Ginny turned over in her mother's arms.

"What are you talking about you're talking about the fact that it's not a normal wedding. I wouldn't be surprised if every year someone has a new member and we claim it's a normal wedding."

"That's not what this is about, Ginny. This is about the future. I'd have to marry you for all of the pain and suffering that you could bring upon us."

"I don't want to imagine it, but it would be perfectly acceptable for a Malfoy to claim he was married to me." Ginny paused, looking over the flowers in the garden.

"You're the only one of us with a daughter, right?"Draco snorted and produced a small box full of presents. Ginny carried the box over to them and dropped them on me. Harry was right. I have to give him my blessing. I had it. He had entered the room and closed the door behind him. The room was cold, dark and empty. There was a book on Potions. I am sure that the professor felt the same way. I saw the small blank shape on the table, but I couldn't put my finger on it. I was staring, and it was not there. Harry looked at me.

"That's my book. I can't tell you anything when I am alone. I would prefer that you would stay with me."He leaned towards my shoulders.

"I believe that you would." I took a deep breath.

"I need to be alone."

"I know." He said.

"You're not hurting me, Draco. I just need some privacy."Draco chuckled and pulled a small box out of his pocket.

"This will be more time-consuming than I could ever give you credit for, if you're so inclined." He sat down, and I could feel his eyes on me.

"I need to get a room for you and Lav-Lav. It will be available within the week."I frowned at that.

"I'm not sure how I can get a room, but I can't tell you what I want, so the best I can do is give you one. You'll have room for only me."

"No, I'd prefer having Lav-Lav, and having a family who are willing to do it. I don't have to do all the work."

"You're probably right about that. I would rather have a younger heir or a younger niece."Draco nodded, and Hermione felt a wave of relief. Even though he knew she was being ridiculous, he didn't need to hear her excuse her to know that she'd made the right decision. If she'd been honest, she'd have been a little too trusting of herself and her son. If she didn't, he'd have to tell her. He had to also tell her that he'd learned a lot from his mother. He had to make sure she wasn't too oblivious to her own dark secrets. She needed to understand that he'd been a good listener, and that she was doing the right thing by him. What was worse was that she had to deal with a growing list of people who were raising hell on her and her husband. She needed to be more careful in her actions. Rodolphus was furious, and he wouldn't stop until all of the Resistance members were dead. Grabbing the chair from her, she turned the corner and began to walk out of the room. She was beginning to wonder if Antonin would be willing to forgive her for her role in her husband's bizarre behavior. Would he want to lose his girlfriend? She didn't know what she was going to do next. In the past, she thought that she would do the right thing, but the future was too uncertain for her to risk her own demise. She wasn't sure what to do next. It was up to her to decide what was best for the situation.

Draco was sitting at the table next to Hermione when she walked in. He was dressed in a simple black and dark suit. The only difference was the fact that the coat of arms had been folded. He wore a dark green button-up that ended at his jawline. Draco hadn't seen any of the violence from his first few days running around. He had a silver bracelet on his finger with a tiny v symbolizing his magic. Hermione was shocked that he hadn't been killed that day. It had been a simple accident. She felt safe around him, but not as safe as she had in the past. She still wasn't sure what could have caused it. She couldn't be sure. He was the greatest mystery she'd ever known. The next day she came home to find the moment her heart stopped. She covered his body with her pillow and back out the door. She was too tired to go back to sleep.

It was the day of the official celebration of sorts for the Resistance. Their leader still in France to this day, and no doubt the biggest fan of the group, but the Dark Lord had given up on him successfully. She didn't understand why he was so willing to throw his lot in with the so-called 'light' side and take up the Dark Mark. He had to admit that most of the people he’d met with were extremely skeptical, but he couldn’t believe that a man like him had the audacity to try to turn his back on his ideals. He could only imagine how many more times he’d have to go through with this plan."That’s it," Hermione said as she watched his hand sink into his back.

"I’ve been planning a test for you for the past few weeks. You’ll need to convince the others of my plans."She raised her eyebrows in wonder.

"You’re not a grownup, Hermione."

"I’m not, he said, and Hermione frowned.

"You’re not the child of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black." She shrugged.

"No offense, Sir. But I’m just a Ravenclaw."

"I’m a Slytherin," he said, a teasing grin growing on his face.

"I’m just a pureblood, you know. One that likes to read and takes great interest in my lessons."He reached his hand out to her, and she opened her small hand and took.

"You’re my daughter, right?"She smiled, and placed her thumb on the small of her back.  You know, I know, I know. Just how it was, and I was here, and I guess I was just tired, and I had to sleep and I was nervous. I was just tired, and I just couldn’t sleep.Then it was just me, and I was just trying to sleep. I guess I was just trying to sleep, I guess I was scared. I guess I just had to sleep, and I guess I didn’t realize it, that I’m one of the only people that I know with that kind of magic.So I woke up with a start and it just happened that I was in my room. I was wearing my hair in a ponytail and I saw that it was in my face. He said I looked like a choke on the balls of his feet." Quickly I turned my head and saw the tear tracks on my chin, and how it was moving around my own eyes." She looked at me and tried to draw out some more, but I forced myself to look at Narcissa.

"Here, take it between your hands and I'll make the most of it." The movement didn't involve much blood, since it was so much more than just a simple 'fuck', but it felt more like human fingers rubbing the skin of the wound."I... I just need to... Is... it okay?" I asked, unsure how to respond."It's fine, Hermione. I... don know why I ever wanted to be a Death Eater."I grimaced, thinking I'd just have to learn to trust her.

"I really don't have time to think of anything else."

"You don't? Well, you're nowhere near as insane as you think you are." Narcissa said, voice light and soothing.

"You have your own person inside of you, and you're trying to be more than that. You're trying to be yourself. To not just control the world around you, but yourself."I nodded, turning away from Narcissa and took a step back, noticing the familiar sizzle in her eyes.

"I can see the differences. I can tell you that you're trying to be yourself. This is not your house, you should be alone." Narcissa replied, tilting her chin up to her wand-tip. A sharp bark of laughter was followed by a more powerful one, a bark of laughter as Severus silenced them both by yanking their ears from their faces, and he was able to pull them out, leaving them hearing a hollow husk.

"You don't have to see this to realize that I don't like the idea of you being alone. I like you being alone, and I don't think you have the energy to fight like you did."Narcissa scoffed.

"You know, I don't live alone, and I don't think you have the energy either, so why would you fight me like I fought against you in the first place?"

"I don't know," Harry admitted quietly. He did not want to spend their next day in Draco's presence, but he would have agreed to let him know if he needed anything else. It was a step in the right direction, and he would do it anyway. He had always been good at hiding his feelings, and being honest about it made him feel better.The Potion Master reached for a hand on his face and Harry was grateful for the velvet cushion, the soft touch, the rest of the evening smooth and warm, not to mention the chocolate. He hated to say it, but Draco had always assumed that the man was a bit too sensitive. Harry took a deep breath and tried to open his eyes. He was sure that the wards around the room were already secure, so he opened his eyes again and saw that they were all closed.

"Let me go inside and see what we’ve been looking for," Harry asked as he opened his eyes. He was shocked to see that the room was completely silent when he opened his eyes.

"Are you sure that you’re alright?" Severus asked looking for something. Harry nodded in response, he didn’t have to wonder if Severus was right or not. He only had to know what to do next. Severus then took off his spectacles and looked through his lashes and sighed.
