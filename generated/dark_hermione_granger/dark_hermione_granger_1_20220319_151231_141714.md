Hermione felt her mind slipping away from her thoughts.

"No, I don't think I will. I'm not determined to have sex with you right now. I will not do so much as a compliment to you or a kiss. I know you're my friend, and I want you to be mine." She panted, her body was warming up again.

"I know you love me, and I love you too. But I don't know how to do this with you right now. You don't have to let go of me, you know me. You'll love me and I'll love you the rest of my life. I won't." Hermione couldn't believe she was lying.

"I don't even know how to kiss you, I'm sorry I just want you to forget about the Dark Arts, okay?"

"No! I don't want you to do that."

"I know, you do. Now do you go and apologize to me or forgive me?" Hermione was tempted to say it was a stupid question, but was actually a good one. It was an honest answer, one that she could give herself. She would simply not forget what she did. So, she would, but only after her next session with Kingsley. In a few months time, she would be able to say 'no'. As for apologizing, well, she had to. Hermione was quite stubborn and wouldn't do something without a plan. She would figure something out, one way or another. Was it possible for a person to be attracted to people they didn’t know? It was only a matter of time before someone discovered the truth, and Draco and Hermione would be the perfect couple, if not a couple.



"I’m sure you’re already aware that I’m not your uncle. I told you in return that you don’t have to go through that sort of trouble."



"I’m sure seeing as I’m your uncle, it’s not as if I wouldn’t be willing to help."



Hermione and Draco shared a look before both turned to leave, the door opened with a clatter in the darkness.

"Where was I? Why am I not here?"

"You'll know soon enough," Hermione said, her eyes narrowing in fear. She didn't need to see the man's face to know that he was already gone. It was too late to turn back up again.

"I felt like a fool, and you're the one who made me. I know you were wondering why I was there, but you must be really angry."She didn't have to see the man's face to know that he was in such a state. Too much anger in one moment could be in too much of a moment. Hermione sighed, looking down at her empty palm.

"I...  I won't let you hurt yourself. All I have to do is do the spell, and I will be as good as safe as you are. Let's go, before you fall."



"I'm sorry, Albus, I hope I didn't do anything wrong."



"You're so sorry for everything you put Theo through." Ron admitted.

"And I'm so sorry for the others that we went through something worse."

"I wasn't there, Ron. Something had to."

"I didn't know, but everything was so foggy and blurry. We weren't even sure how we were going to get back to the castle."



"Ronald, we haven't gotten there, but we're coming." Hermione said, and Ron reached for the hospital wing.

"I be there, too. I'll help him get the wand."

"Do you think he'll use it?" Ron asked, and Hermione nodded.

"He's not about to use it."Narcissa's arm started to quiver as she didn't make sense.

"I don't think he'll. He's not the sort of person to take the Dark Mark."

"Good, Hermione, you can take care of your mother. There's still magic here and she'll be okay. I'm sure you'll be alright here."

"Okay, okay. So you're talking to a healer, right? I'm sure you'll be fine."

"I'm, but yes. I will take care of my mother. She's in Azkaban right now. She's just a child. You have to save her."

"I don't know. I don't want to save her. I just want to get out of here and to be safe."

"I know. But I don't know how to go back. I have to help her."Hermione tried to remember what happened to her. He was planning to take her away from them? She didn't know how to go. It was a mystery. She just had to figure it out. When she knew that he was planning on taking her away, she felt more confident. It was what she needed to do to survive, not him.



"Merlin, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have any hope of escaping the safety of your room, my dear. I'm sure you can't believe that I'd just leave you here on the floor, and leave you to your bed." Draco's eyes went wide. He was going to kill her.

"I'm sure, my dear. I'm not leaving you here. I'm not leaving you out of my house. You know that you're not alone."

"I'm not alone, my love." Draco said softly.

"I'm with you. I'm not dying out here for the Death Eaters."

"I don't have the time to do it, my love. You don't have the energy."

"Fine. I'll do it. I'm going to do it all over again." He said looking at her with a smirk, and she felt her heart skip a beat when he said, "For now, I just love you, and I'm going to do this for you. Just this once. Just this once."

"No, you don't. I understand that. Just this once." She said, letting her eyes wander to the window.Walking towards the window, Hermione held the window open so she could see the ocean waves. She could see the waves coming her way in the early morning sunlight. She felt the leaves of the ocean starting to turn a shade of violet when she opened her eyes, and in the distance, she heard the name "The Sound of Music" from Sirius's guitar. Hermione went to the kitchen to prepare a pot of tea and then to read the book.



The first thing she noticed that morning was how easy it was to extract the meaning from a verse. Hermione was glad that Sirius kept her mesmerized by the song. It was so easy to hear how much she enjoyed the song, even without the ambient sounds.Hermione picked up the book she had read and took a seat at the table in front of the fireplace. She was studying the text, trying not to look at it in her mind. It was clear in her eyes that she understood something. That was a clue that Sirius had been listening to what she was reading. She looked down at the text again and saw that it was Hermione's.

Cara Delacour) - Arctic MonaiseEverything is so exciting, but I don’t see the same sparkle in the light. I see flashes of blue, but nothing as intense as the flashes in the darkness. I wonder if Draco’s eyes are as red as mine. I hear a sound - they start to glow. I’m in a classroom, the light from the torches is reflected in the glass, and I can’t see anything.

"I had a really hard time believing that you are here." he wraps his arms around my shoulders and presses his forehead against mine.

"I’m so sorry," I whisper.

"It’s okay, I love you." He pulls me towards him, and kisses me.

"I’m so so so so so so so so... " he breathes in my ear.

"Don’t you dare do that to me. I don’t want to hurt you, I don’t want to hurt you any more than you already do."

"I will! he snarls.

"I will take your heart and mind and make them bleed for the rest of their lives," he shouts. I am all ready to kneel before the wolf inside of me, I can’t do this right now.

"I will," he kisses his way down my throat, his lips brushing over my mouth.

"You can’t be so stupid," I tell him.

"That is not your fault!" he growls. I am so close, but my chest is still trembling, I can’t watch him.

"You are not the only one who has your heart broken." I pull my ribs back and look around.

"Where’s Harry?"

"I’m not sure." I look in the mirror, I can’t find any tears.

"He’s fine." I look at the Death Eaters together and I know that I don’t have to explain a thing.

"Harry is on his way to Hogwarts. You should stay with him." I look at the twins. They are sitting in the study, waiting to drop Harry off.

"Why?" they ask. I look at them.

"Because I trust you. I’m only twelve." I look at them and raise my brow a little in shock.

"You haven’t told me, have you?" He looks at me confused. My face goes back to neutral, I can see that he is not upset with me.

"What is wrong with you, Sirius?"

"You are my brother, everything I hold dear is just made because of you." I sigh deeply, feeling guilty.

"No, your father is my friend. I told you, I won’t hurt you, and I love you... " he looks towards me.

"I love you...  My magic is stronger and more powerful than your own." I wipe the tears away from my face.

"Don’t look at me like that." He holds my chin as he looks at me.

"We are to watch, I want to do a lot of magic to the people here. We have to cover you." I roll my eyes.

"You are smart," I add. He looks at me and nods.

"We will cover you, right away. I want to do more magic. One day. Maybe over the summer." He looks at me and vows to do more in the future.

"I’ll make sure you are okay. I hate the feeling of you not knowing." I hug him, kissing his cheek.

"I love you, Ron."

 a good day." I tell him, kissing his cheek again.

"I love you, Ron."He just shakes his head and turns me away, holding my hand over his.

"Never thought you'd like it." I snort.

"You really enjoyed it, Zabini."I dangle a hand over his mouth in surrender.

"I’m sorry... " he tries to not say it, but I can’t keep up with it. I let the kiss go, he just grabs my face and kisses me. We kiss for a few more minutes or three, kissing in silence. Both of us are wrapped in a blanket in the middle of the woods. He kisses me, and we share a kiss as the woods around us fades away to black. I try to remember where we are and what we are doing.



Waking up in bed is a nightmare. I am awake and feel my body so relaxed. I am smiling and a bit worried about my mood. I can’t even remember the last time I felt so free. I am feeling very calm and just about ready to fall back asleep. I have a book in my hand about how to change my mood, I am focussing on the spells on the cupboard. I can’t remember the last time I had to fall asleep. I can’t remember how it was." Hermione sighed.

"I hope that the rest of the year doesn’t go by like that."

"I’m sorry for everything," Draco said.

"It’s not your fault that I was gone or anything."Hermione swallowed, feeling her cheeks burn.

"It’s my fault that I was taken away from you."

"I’m sorry for everything," he said softly.

"I’ll never do anything to ruin it. I like the feeling of being close to you, Draco, even if I don’t like it."

"I’m not sure what you mean by that," Hermione said, a bit more of a sheepish expression than she was used to with these sorts of arguments."Well, I sort of do. I’m not sure what Blaise’s relationship is to me, but I’ve heard from a few people that he’s always been attracted to older people and older women. He just doesn’t seem to fit into that picture."Draco smiled.

"Well that explains why you don’t like him so much. He’s not a woman, and I don’t think he’ll hold a similar view towards you."The blush that came to the young man’s cheeks was tinged with mischief."I suppose I’ll be perfectly safe with you." Harry said, pulling out his wand and casting a disillusionment charm. The young Gryffindor looked up in shock and confusion, his wand now hanging in his hand like a lightning rod."What about you, Potter?" Neville asked, his anger getting the better of him."I’ll be safe with you." Harry said confidently."I won’t be." Harry said in a tone that made Neville gape.

"If I had a choice, I’d choose you."

"I just joking, Granger," Fred told him.

"I’ve been avoiding you all this year."Fred and George moved away from Fred and George’s group, stopping outside the door of the Black library. Harry was still close enough to Harry that he could carry around a book of Ancient Runes without being suspicious. They were walking behind Fred and George, looking straight ahead."I keep thinking that you’re here," Fred told them."I think we’re right," George said, an annoyed look on his face."I’m sorry, you’d think I’d be alright." Fred hugged him, pulling him into a cozy embrace.Fred pulled his sweater back, revealing a new look upon him."I’m sorry, too." He whispered."If you look like this, you’re not a ghost." Fred whispered."You...  you are." Fred smiled."I’m still not safe." Fred continued."Don’t worry, you know that." Fred moaned."I’ll get the hell out of here." Fred chuckled, pulling his wand out and casting a cutting charm.Fred watched in fascination as the light slowly turned on his face before he turned around and walked away, leaving Fred beside him. 



I sat there, waiting for Fred. 



"You look... different."



"You're not?"



"I'm not sure. I don't want to see you like this."



"You already killed my parents?"



"No, Hermione, no more. I don't want to see you like this anymore. I'm sorry."



"You can't."



"I'm sorry that I didn't find that kind of love last night. I won't be the same witch I am now. I'm not the witch that you're known for."



I could feel her face change, her eyes brighten, and she looks... more human than I ever imagined.

"You're my fiance, and we're going to get married!"

"You're not..." Narcissa looked at her wife, and her face was a mask.

"No, I'm not a fool, I know that. But you're my fiance, and I want to get married. I can't ask you to be in a wedding-"Narcissa had a bit of a flashback of her own marriage, and it was so reminiscent of the way she looked at her parents back in their days.

"I just..."

"You're a witch. And I don't want to see that."

"That's not what this is." Narcissa said, and it took a moment for the tears to stop flowing.
