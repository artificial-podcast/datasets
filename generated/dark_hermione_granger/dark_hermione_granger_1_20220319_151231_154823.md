She sent him a wink before taking her seat next to her. She didn't know what he was thinking. The man just seemed so... messy, and unsure what he was doing with it. It was like she was missing something important."I'm fine. I'm sorry."His next words were so gentle, so warm, and so full of love. She felt such a rush of happiness that she didn't know it at the time. It was such a shock to hear him say them for the umpteenth time. Hermione knew that she couldn't allow herself to forget it for a moment. She had to be better than this."No, you're not. You're too much of a coward to try and sleep with someone you trust."His wink made her feel only slightly better and her eyes fell closed. She couldn't believe what she just read. Maybe this book was the only explanation for her past issues. Maybe it was the only reason she could remember what happened after she ran away. She wondered if there was a way she could tell him off for being a total fella while he was away. His arrogance wouldn't last long and she worried that she'd give him a new lease on life.It was early afternoon in London when Hermione finally decided how to act towards Lee. She made her decision, and she was ready. She was a complete arse to begin with, but she knew she had to be bold. She had to appear relaxed, not overly sensitive or nervous. She could be a bit of a flobbering idiot if she didn't think it's alright to be nervous. She was a Gryffindor in the most Gryffindor-like of ways. He had been a very quiet and withdrawn person. He was the only person who could hear her clearly.

"I told you before, Granger, I don't want to hurt you anymore. You deserve everything you've got. I know that, but I also know that you don't deserve all of it." She whispered in the silvery tones they shared.

"You don't deserve you. You're the prize. You're the brightest witch of our age. You can't ever be as good as everyone else."

"Nobody can ever be as good as you can be."It wasn't just any woman, it was also a man. A man who was willing to go down a very dark path. His greatest fear at being a werewolf was the constant threat of hypnosis. Antonin was a gifted mind healer. One of the few people in the entire known world who could produce a patient with the ability to see and feel the thoughts of others, he was able to induce dreams that could be cheered up by his wife. Hermione had always wanted to be a full man, wanted to be on the high side of the Dark Lord's power. It was a fantasy she could never get over. Men and women like her simply couldn't exist. Antonin believed that he would make a good Husband if he allowed the truth to come out. No doubt the Resistance was quite willing to believe him. But, if he was truly honest, why would they believe that he was only truthful because they knew he was a liar? Another possibility was that he was one of them, but Hermione doubted that. There was a time when she trusted the man. Maybe now she would be able to look forward to that day. Maybe not forever. Did he even know what he was doing? Part of her was very sure that he was doing it for the best that he'd done in years to make certain that Thorfinn could be his best friend. It would be very sweet of him to be so generous to a friend that she loathed."If it's not you, I'm not sure you're sure who it is."He cleared his throat, "Mr. Weasley, I want to thank you for your time in my office today. I wish you the best of luck, and I wish you a happy birthday." She smiled, and he hopped off of the couch and stepped out of his back pocket.He waved a goodbye, and Hermione felt her heart begin to beat faster to her chest. She was thankful that she'd already seen the scar on his chest when she first met him. The Dark Lord smiled, and she knew it was right. She had to thank him for that.



She pulled the covers down over her head and looked around. There were a lot of people walking around but...  no, no, no."They’re all black!" Harry cried.

"I want to just go!"

"No, no, no! Harry! You can’t go with them!" Hermione said, trying her best to ignore all the stares."Are you alright?" Harry asked."I’m fine." Hermione said quietly.

"I’ll come with you."She disappeared with a flash. Harry watched as they approached the small house in the woods. He was just about to ask what was wrong when a house elf popped into the small room, pulling out a white notebook. He quickly took out one of the books and flipped through it."What do you want?" Ron asked, looking around."I wanted to get some more information on the Black family." Draco explained."I read it somewhere, you were worried about them."

"I was." Ron looked at him and nodded."I’m sorry?" Ron asked with tears in his eyes."Nothing." Draco said softly.

"I’ve been wanting to ask you a lot of questions."

"You’re the best." Draco said."I’m the best." Ron snarled." this the first time those two have this conversation?" Ginny asked in a high pitched voice."Yes. It is." Ron said with a smile."I’m really sorry about Ron’s comments," Hermione said with a smirk.

"I’m so sorry about how he’d made his hair stand up."

"Marry me, mate. I’m a Weasley." Hermione said."Oh, and a Weasley." Ginny said.

"I’ll be the best to you."Hermione sighed.

"I’m a Weasley." She said with a smile. was not your type." Hermione shrugged."I thought you were a Malfoy."

"I am." He said, leaning closer.Hermione felt a rush of heat wash over her. She took a step back.

"I’m sorry," she whispered.

"I’m a Weasley."

"I tried so hard to not say anything."

"I hope you’re alright. I’ll meet you up with Gwyneira."

"I’ll never take care of you, Granger."

"I’ll see you in Heaven after all of this." felt a rush of magic as she watched the top of the Astronomy Tower rise and fall with a shimmering white light. She couldn’t help but notice how it didn’t seem to slow down. Perhaps it was a result of the many spells that were present on the roof of the castle, or an odd effect of the light being reflected from the walls. She wasn’t sure. But she was sure it was a result of the magic being reflected back from the walls."Don’t leave me alone, Granger," Draco promised.Hermione felt her magic ripple through the air, as she watched Draco’s hand drop to his waist and disappear. She pulled on the sleeve of her sleeve, feeling something wet on her. She was too far away from the man to notice, but she knew. She knew soon.



Song: The End of the World - Noah CyrusEverything was right there in the present, and was right now. She looked up, seeing the same familiar lines that had formed for so many times in her head. What am I? What am I doing in here? She thought about the music, but none of it made sense. It was just her sitting in the chair, humming to a tune Draco was writing. Song: Dora the Black - The Rolling StonesShe felt desperation in her eyes, her eyes were halfway open They were all wide and searching for something. She didn’t have a clue where to begin searching and she didn’t have time to wait for the answer.She found nothing at all interesting but she was afraid to not be able to see the source of the darkness. She was in desperate need of a distraction."Hermione?" Astoria asked softly as she turned the corner from Pansy’s column."I’m sorry," she said, her eyes flickering to the fire.

"I don’t know what happened but I’ve been worried about you."

"I’m Astoria," she said, her voice so low that it was barely audible.Hermione shrugged. If he’d ever been able to hear her, he’d probably be able to remember the way she spoke."I know Astoria well," she said.

"She spends a great deal of time with me and I was the only one of you with Astoria. Before that, I was his best friend, and now I’m his fiancé."

"You know Astoria," Draco said.

"She spends a lot of time with me and is always near me."

"For what it’s worth," she said.

"I’m not his best friend He’s not even my best friend."

"Neither is Neville."

"That wasn’t a secret," Narcissa said.

"They’ve been friends for years. Even before the war you both were professors."Narcissa hummed.

"So... friends?" she asked.

"Yes, but other than Neville, I’m your best friend. I’m your best friend’s best friend. It’s not like I have to pretend you don’t like a person to be who it is."

"I do," she said.

"I suppose that’s the whole reason I’ve been able to stay in my own bed for so long. I’ll never know, though."Hermione was frowning, but nodded.

"Indeed."

"Of course, Miss Granger," drawled Theo.

"I’m sure you’ve heard it before."

"Yes," said Astoria, though she didn’t sound nearly as happy as Hermione about it.

"I’ve heard it before and I’m sure you know it."Hermione thought it was a bit cavalier of Astoria to imply that she was better at talking about things than Astoria herself, but it was enough to make her laugh. Hermione tried to remember when she'd first seen her in the library, with the book he'd mentioned, when she'd first attempted to remember her own memories of that night. She remembered it as being a week before the Dark Lord collapsed. The intense pain helped.By the morning of the first full moon that week, Hermione had regained enough of Astoria's memories to feel like she had a solid recollection of what happened that night. She had a perfect memory of that day. She had Draco biting her arm in Rodolphus' kitchen the night before, but no matter how many times she tried, she couldn't remember. She couldn't remember even fucking that night. After she knew what she'd seen she told him about the day before and he was almost as surprised as she was.He still didn't know.



The first morning of the new year was a horrible time to be a mother. It was the start of a new year, and every single person that anyone entrusted to them was going to miss out on something important. It was a tradition that was flourishing in many cultures. Not just in the U.S., but in every single country that had an exploding Muggle population that year.Mum, dad and Uncle Rabastan were all present when the L.A. Kings was attacked by a group of blood supremacists. They were forced to flee with their belongings and flee again, this time with a new identity for their children. I'm afraid I cannot keep that secret from you, Draco." Harry was shocked.

"What?" Draco asked incredulously.

"Why did you show me your baby boy?"

"I’m afraid there will be no way of protecting you. You will remain an Unspeakable and you will be protected, whether you like it or not." Harry couldn’t help but laugh.

"You know, I didn’t know, I was just told that I had no choice" Draco answered, his eyes narrowing in disbelief.

"I’m an Unspeakable that I could protect you?" Harry asked incredulously.

" Unspeakable?" Sirius nodded.

"And you know what? I’m not the only one capable of doing that." Harry said, not even sounding sincere.

"And no one can do that to you!" Sirius snapped.

"Then why did you do it? What did you do, do you know who? Who is the person?" Harry demanded.

"The Horcrux, of course." Sirius whispered.

"No one is the only one capable of doing that." Harry spat.

"What? It’s a Horcrux?" Harry asked, knowing what his Father would say.

"It’s an incredibly powerful spell." Harry said while looking around.

"How did you get it?" Daphne asked.

"Well, since I didn’t use it before, I figured it had to be someone’s spell." Harry quickly looked at his Father.

"Well, it’s not as if it isn’t powerful." Daphne said.

"I’ve used it on a number of people. It’s not as strong as the Horcrux, but it’s not as powerful as the Horcrux." Harry and Daphne both smiled joyfully and said in unison, "Okay, but I don’t think you understand."

"You don’t," Blaise said.

"It’s a difficult concept, and you’ll have to be smarter than that."Hermione nodded in agreement.

"Yes. It’s a bit like the unicorn, really." She lifted her head and looked at her parents.

"I’ve always wanted one."Hermione had never heard of a unicorn before, and she’d never felt either of them so happy or cared for her like this. She’d never seen one but had never wanted one. As far as Blaise knew, they had to do with the new romantic couple that had been formed with Lord Potter and Lady Luna Lovegood. One that had not only enjoyed their time together, but in the months since the couple had gone back to their friends and family. That evening was no different.Draco was so lost in his thoughts that he didn’t notice when the lights dimmed on the bar. His robes were still a little too warm, his hair a little too grey, his eyes a little too dark. He was staring at the two men with such intense fascination that he almost missed the twins who were sitting behind him, watching as he watched the two of them settle into conversation. He knew the whole story, but he had never gotten the chance."I’ sure he’d have been able to find your father if he hadn’t been so determined."

"I think he’d have found you a cousin."

"How is he going to figure that out?"

"I’m sure he won’t."Theo nodded his head in agreement. He knew the rest of the story, but knew the twins were close enough to know the story."Could you tell him the real story?"

"I think he’ll tell him this morning."Theo’s eyes slid down to the diary parcel. He knew it was fake, but knew the twins had sent it Hermione knew it was fake, but knew they would never know it, and it would be obvious for as long as she lived. She had to always be cautious, even in the face of danger. Now that they knew it was real, she knew she could protect them.



Another day passed, and Hermione felt very tired. She had a great fear that other witches or wizards had been able to figure out the secret chamber. She wasn't sure she even wanted to try it, especially not now that she knew the twins' secret tunnel existed. Her exhaustion was making her skip every class. It was making her wish to go to bed. It was only fair.
