Albus, do you really think it is safe to have someone with you who can keep these secrets?", he asked, and she bit her lip.

"I don’t know, if it’s even safe to have."

"I’ll tell you eventually,", she agreed, and then, her face slid down to the top of her parchment. She looked forward to it. She had to.



And then, just as quickly as it had appeared, it was gone. She’d never seen it before, and she had no idea how to place it. The only clue she had was that she had thought it was a special project of hers that would be used to test the accuracy of the spell. She was certain she could handle a spell on her own. Though she'd been present for the last few minutes, she hadn't made any progress. Maybe it was possible that she could improve the spell. Though she was sure she would never be able to, maybe one of the Resistance's witches could. She'd already showed her fear when she killed the man who threatened her. She was sure the man wasn't innocent. There was enough of that to make her believe that he wasn't innocent at all. If her instincts were correct, he was still alive and well. She was no fool. If the Resistance wasn't on her side, she might never see the day they once did fall. She wasn't sure what they were willing to do."Ant is a good man." He lifted his head to look at her. She didn't know what to say.

"You're a horrible man, but I don't care. I'm here, and I'm not just here for you." He paused, looking at her.

"You know that about me, too. I'm not going to let you hurt anyone else." He nodded, and Hermione could see the scowl on his face.

"You're not going to hurt me."

"No, you're not." She looked at him again and tried to not pout.

"I'm not going to hurt anyone, and I won't apologize if that hurts you."He sighed.

"You're a fool who thought it worth risking your life to not be born a wizard."Hermione felt her heart breaking. The man was worried. What if he just doesn't want to be born a wizard? It was too dark and dangerous to just make a choice. Besides, he'd never been able to prove his worth. He'd simply assumed he would be a stronger candidate for the position than a pureblood. Yet, when the Dark Lord showed up and challenged his own son, he'd been unable to prove either his worth or that of his father. He needed to prove himself worthy of the title of 'father', and that meant nothing if he simply could convince the other men to join his cause. Harry was glad that it was working.It was impossible to tell what sort of potion was in question. Hermione didn't care. She would get her answers. Wouldn't matter. She was on the only side of the war that anyone else could have a chance against. Part of her felt like she was back in Knockturn Alley, being a prisoner in the basement of the Ministry of Magic for the last four years. The other part was that in all of them, she was the only one. Even with the Resistance being on the move, they were only allowed to exist under the Dark Lord's rule.The slow, steady churning of metal filled the space. A single step forward could take a person nearly as long. She could feel the veins in her arms beginning to open. The pain in her head was getting more intense as she realized they were about to try and reenter her brain. The blurry image of Harry Potter's face went from a blank to a vibrant red as he finally spoke.

"I'm sure you feel the same."

"I do, Hermione."

"I did, but your mind is very different from mine. I know that you're trying to protect me, but I've tried to protect you. I know you and Ron are trying to get out, but I want to protect you. I want to protect you."

"I know, but I can help." She looked at the open wound on her forehead, then at the open wounds around her eyes.

"I just...  I just don't want to hurt you. I know it's difficult but I'll do what I can." With a smile, Hermione laughed loudly again.

"You know how to make a wife happy. I still have too much on my hands."

"Shame is poison." Blaise snorted.

"You know how. Maybe we can help you if you want."

"I don't want to hurt you." Hermione scoffed.

"I just want...  I don't know, love is strong. It just doesn't work like that anymore."

"You know, I'm not sure I like your idea, Blaise. You seem to have a lot on your plate and I don't know how to help you. Maybe we can come up with a new plan." Theo teased.

"The one that doesn involve you. At least not without me. Would you fancy a slice of gingerbread girl, Hermione?"

"I would love a slice of gingerbread girl," Hermione said, her cheeks tinted pink.

"Don't you dare think that I have a crush on you while I'm sleeping."

"I don't," Blaise snapped.

"I don't even know who you are!"

"I think you know who I am," Theo said.

"I think you like her."

"I do, but I don't know who." Blaise bit his lip. Hermione was on edge about that particular part of the plan. Blaise had carefully avoided mentioning that he was bisexual, but his friend knew. He'd had a crush on her in school, but they hadn't even spoken since. Hermione hated that there was a chance he'd leave her and never come back. Was that what he wanted? It was so hard to take such a risk with the former Quidditch captain. As far as she was aware, there were no plans with him, and the last thing he wanted was to harm her. The wizard was tired of being second-class to none of his friends.The door to the bathroom clicked shut behind him. He'd been startled by the sound of his own door opening. He bit back a laugh at the sight before him. He should've expected the first time. The visitor was no longer in the bathroom. Hermione felt her eyes widen with fear. What exactly do they have planned?



Voldemort is dead, my son is dead, and I am the last person I would want to have a child with.



I thought back to the day I was in the Astronomy Tower. It was dark, and Voldemort seemed to have taken a stroll through the station, looking for a new seat. I had a very curious look on my face and knew that it was a trap. Just how do I even get down there?



There was a door on the edge of the wall and I saw it open. Harry was looking at me as if I was some kind of trap, and I could see the fear in his eyes. Did I put too much into this His eyes had a slate grey, shining, lifeless look. This was for me, not you!" Harry cried, and Hermione was glad that he’d come out of his shell and started sobbing.

"He’s not a man, Harry. He’s a freak, and I’ve been dealing with him for years so I can handle him." Hermione scoffed.

"But he’s not a freak! I don’t want to hurt him!" Harry yelled, and Hermione almost gaped at the sheer force of Draco’s voice.

"What?! How dare you! I’m a freak! I’m not a witch! I’m not a saint!"He stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind him. The door flew open, revealing a dark-haired platinum blonde. She looked exhausted, and Draco was amazed by the way she looked.



"I’d never seen you this late! I’ve seen you look this great in the mirror!", Draco said, crossing his arms and smiling as he let her through.



She was so beautiful! She looked so old, like she’d lost her wings! She even looked like a goddess! But Draco wouldn’t be able to pronounce her properly.



He looked over at her, his eyes wide, silver as midnight. Hermione smiled again, feeling that he was right.



"What do you want?" She asked, with a shake of her head.



"I want to get married and have children," he said, and Hermione felt a wave of happiness wash over her.



"What? No?" She asked, feeling her heart skip a beat in her chest. She now knew that he was right, and that she could only do that if he was allowed to marry her.



"Yes," he said, his eyes bright and sad.

"I want to get married and raise a family."



Slytherin's Snake, he was right.



They went to bed together, and Hermione felt herself grow more restless with each passing day. She had some ideas, but they were the only ones she could think of that made sense. She woke up in her own bed after crawling into the dream, still feeling restless. In the morning, she received a letter from Malfoy, asking her to come with him and have tea with him. She was given a week free period, but she had to give it to him. (She wasn't really going to allow herself to sleep with Malfoy, not in a free period of any sort is what I was told. But she did, and she's had better sleep than I've ever had, and she's even more content now that she is accepting him as a friend and not just a friend.) She didn't know what to do next.



"Wait, what are you doing here?"



He wasn't walking, but she knew. He was a bit too smart for his own good and she didn't want to risk it.



"My room is on the second floor."



Something in her eyes flashed and she smiled. She knew what he was doing and she was so grateful for that. He was brilliant



"I want you to come here and join me for tea."



She smiled softly and turned her head. Draco was a very soft-spoken man and was always so full of life.



"I’m right here. She moved with her eyes, sending a smirk at him. He nodded his head, a smirk that promised. It was the first thing she said that evening.



"Good night, Granger. Good night." She smiled, waving her hand over her head.



"Good night." She smiled back, walking smoothly through the crowd and while she did so felt herself being drawn back by them.



Afterwards she turned her attention to Draco and feeling his wolf eyes on her.



"W-what are you doing here?" She asked his eyes, observing him.



"I don’t know. I suppose I was the only one." Draco shrugged."That’s good to know." Hermione smiled."I thought I had a good start." Draco finished."Good start." Hermione blushed."What are you doing here?" Draco asked."Let me go and I will see you for dinner." Hermione said, grabbing her cloak and using her magic to pull it into her back pocket."What are you doing? You’re such a...  slippery sort." Draco snarled.

"I see."Hermione whipped her wand out and pointed it at him."You know," Draco started.

"You’re the best at that, Granger." He paused, trying to remember something.

"I told you, I told you. I had to get the name Malfoy."The Slytherin opened his mouth to argue, but stopped himself before he got it.

"You don’t know that, Granger. You don’t know that."Hermione shook her head.

"No, I don’t. I just don’t."

"Well, I figured if you didn’t know about it you could’ve been sure that I would’ve."

"I’m sure you’re not." Hermione stopped.

"I didn’t know that."

"I do, you idiot," Ron was starting to say.

"I was so worried when my Mother would be gone, and I got a letter."Hermione had her wand out and she looked at Ron.

"Oh, shit." She was startled by a voice.

"What are you... ?"

"I was told to wait for Professor Snape to arrive before sending it." Ron started.

"You can’t send it then."

"What?" Hermione scolded.

"I’m his assistant and he’s a professor. It’s our job. But I don’t have the time or the ability to deal with every single question. I’m a simple guy, I can do things. I don’t need any help."Harry looked at her, confused.

"What?"

"I don’t know," she said angrily.

"It’s obvious you don’t understand."

"Because you don’t." Harry said.

"I’m a simple man. I can’t do anything without a lot of help."The silence was so thick that Harry felt like a speck of dust. He looked back up at Hermione and said, "I think I know who did this; Draco Malfoy. He was the one who found me, and he's been gone for months."Hermione nodded and took a step back.

"I'm sorry. I just couldn't bear the thought of him getting involved!"Draco shook his head.

"I didn't have any other ideas." He glanced to her, then back up again.

"I just had to see if I could find a way to help him. I don't have any other options than to prove my worth as a Death Eater."Hermione nodded, then she looked at him.

"And you know how much I enjoy spending a good night with my friends."

"That's what I wanted," he said.

" like you to join me for a walk around the gardens."

"I'd like that." Hermione said, walking around the gardens. Hermione was a short walk before she reached the tea room where she found her friends. She wasn't sure how long they stayed in there, but the longer she stayed, the more uncertainty she felt. She couldn't explain it all to them, but she felt nervous about leaving the grounds. Pansy was just as anxious to return to her home as Draco was. They had to be careful.Without another word, Hermione followed the paths and gardens. She slipped under the shade and listened to the voices of the house-elves."When you return, we'll be gone. I'll make my way to the kitchen." Harry interrupted, before he could blink, a door opened, matching the position of the books he'd been reading. Ron's face was in the mirror and he looked up, at the elf's question.

"What do you want to know? I'm not your best friend, I don't have the ability to tell you what to read."

"I don't need to know," Hermione said, her voice soft.

"It's just a question." She reached into her pocket and pulled out a small black box.

"It's a wand."

"What do you have there, Ron?" He asked in confusion.

"What is it, and why do you have it in your room?"

"You don't have to answer that Malfoy. I can get that damned book."

"I'm not sure I want to know what you're talking about, Malfoy, I just want you to be able to get that damn book."

"I know, I can, but this book is too valuable."

"You've got research behind you, Granger." He said, offering her a hand to open the cover. Without asking her permission, he slipped his hand through hers to hold her hand in his.

"You've got Sputum on your desk."He rose and opened the door, revealing what appeared to be a sealed book. It was a scroll he had tucked inside her quill, tucked deep inside his own parchment. I've done a lot worse this year than last.
