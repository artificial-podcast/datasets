Harry stared out the window quietly wishing it had been the way he did. Hermione had been there earlier for Draco's wedding. No, he didn't mean it. He was horrified that he had to resort to such drastic measures. She supposed it made sense. Maybe he had a plan.The first flicker of hope that Hermione could be the person she truly wanted to be seemed to disappear as her eyes followed his movements. It was not his face that was staring back. Draco smiled softly as if he was waiting for a moment. The other woman stepped forward, seeming to be the perfect foil to the powerful woman he had once been. She took a step forward, prepared to take him down with her, but stepped back. Draco knew what she was doing."A message for Cor It might be a good idea to send an owl while you're at it." She looked out the window and looked out the door again, but Corban's eyes widened when she saw him.

"Corban would be the perfect gentleman to send a message to."

"A message? No, it's not a message." Draco's face fell.

"It's not a question. I think we both know what's happening." He hit his head on the windowsill and leaned down to kiss her.

"I think is the perfect gentleman."

"Good for you. Corban, I think we need to run away. I'm going to the Manor."

"Yes, well, I'm going to the library. I need to see the Dark Lord I have to come here and help him defeat me, and have him believe he can do it. I can't. I can't. I don't want to do this. I don't want to do this. I can't. I don't want to be this. I can't. I can't. I only want to help him. I know I do, but I don't want to go through all this now. I can't. I don't want to do this. I don't want to be this. I can't. I don't want to be this. I can't. I don't want to be this. I don't want to be this. I don't want to be this. I don't know what your plans are. You'd be a terrible teacher and you've already messed up."

"You know what I mean. The Dark Lord wants me to be a good teacher, but he also wants me to be happy."

"Why don't you tell me why you want me as a friend?"

"Because I'm the only person in a relationship that I have a relationship with."Hermione was torn between the anger she felt at seeing Draco kiss Draco and the words she needed to say that she wouldn't be able to keep. She couldn't trust herself to speak truthfully and honestly about Draco because that would make him a mudblood. The Malfoy family was complicated and it was her fault that she was the only parent. She had to She was the one who would get Antonin in trouble. The man would have to. After what she thought was a week of careful preparation, he had her arrested. She was there to harm herself. Her husband had to. She was the one who would get the man arrested. She was there to get Antonin out of prison. She was there to get her family out of the country. She was there to get the wizard out of Azkaban. It was all in her control. She had to do it all for her son. If she could be that woman, why was she always the only parent? She had a son to care for.She was in her final moments before she was going to her final exam. She knew it was going to be a long night for her and she was exhausted of sitting around and doing nothing. She didn't like the sound of her thoughts and she couldn't stop thinking what was going to happen next."You know, I'm not your enemy anymore. I'm the best person in the world for not being able to control you."

"You're not! You're not who you portray yourself to be!"

"I never said that I would become what I want to become, Narcissa. I've always been a person who wanted to be like that."She was right. She was afraid of what she would say to that exact statement. There was no need to be so dramatic about it. It was an honest lie. She wasn sure that she could stand watching, but she didn't want to. Antonin's eyes widened when she met his eyes. He took a step back when she looked up to meet her eyes. She was still holding her breath when he reached out to touch her hand. With a gentle hand, he gently brushed her hair from her face. He wanted to feel her body against his, to feel how she loved it. She was his body and she loved him back. He kissed her gently and promised her that he would keep her updated on her progress.



Hermione wasn't able to sleep long. She didn't feel any pain that night and it didn't take long for him to get used to the water. She took advantage of the moment to go to the kitchen to fix up the last of her breakfast, then took a seat in front of the fireplace of the fireplace to eat her breakfast.



"I’m sure you’re having trouble sleeping, Blaise. I’ve tried all sorts of potions." She looked up from her plate to see him on his best friend’s couch, watching her drink half of her hot chocolate and eat his food.



"I’m sure you’ve all had similar experiences, but they’re all very... 



very...  uncomfortable." He swallowed the chocolate and swallowed another swallow of marshmallow.



"I never, Draco glared at him, his eyes lit with a brilliant gleam before he scoffed again.

"No."

"Shut up, Draco," Blaise scoffed, stirring his drink and pouring in his glasses with his hands.

"What’s going on?"He fidgeted in his chair, his face a mask, and leaned back, turning his head to stare at Draco."I’m not sure," Hermione said with a smirk, her hands on the table."It’s an old friend of mine," Blaise said with a smirk.

"She was mine when I was training in the summer, she said, sitting up and sitting down.Hermione half groaned.

"I don’t have time for this," she said, looking up from where she had her book.

"I’ll go get my books."The two of them skimmed through their textbooks and paused, not looking up from the questions. Hermione had asked a couple of questions and the professor had handed out the answers."Can I be a bad boy in class?" she asked.

"I’m a girl."She really didn’t like the idea of taking on a boy, but she still felt better knowing that she could be a girl."I been thinking about being a girl ever since I turned thirteen. I always thought I was clever, but I have never been one."Hermione rushed out of the kitchen, her heart racing. She had no idea what to do. She probably thought that she was doing a good job as a girl, or rather, that she was doing a good job as a boy. They always had some sort of muggles in their life. She didn’t want to have to look at them too often.Hermione had to double down on her bad feeling. She needed to tell someone that she was okay and was not trying to hide her feelings. She was going to get that book. She had to.



" was, um, Hermione."Pansy looked like she was reading a book about dark magic."That’s not what I’m asking."

"It’s alright. You’re here. I’m okay with this." She was so relieved by this."I’ll be an owl."Hermione hated to admit that she was right, of course, but she’d been feeling this way for several days. She’d been feeling lonely. It was a bad thing that she’d been doing all week. She’d gotten so used to being around people that she didn’t even notice the scowl on his face when he tried to stare at her. He once told her that he and Hermione were always in the same room together."I’m worried about you, Granger," she said softly.

"I’ve been away for months, and I’ve never seen you like this."

"I am," he said, looking at her with a smirk.

"And I’ve seen you a million times."He looked around the room at her and she found that there were two sets of mirrors around the corner of the room, one with the mirror in, the other set of mirrors back in. She took a few moments to look up at the golden ceiling figure to see it surrounded by two giant, droning-in beams. Her heart thudded and her eyes slid downwards to meet the giant, round eyes of the golden-eyed bride. She looked into the golden beams, and to her surprise, she saw how the beams looked sky-high and dark and menacing in comparison. She had never seen anything like it before in her life. And for once, it looked positively angelic.The bride, as much as the star-studded pair looked alike, the bride turned and appeared to be a blonde haired man walking down the aisle, his face and all-too-human hair in disarray. His eyes roamed over the ceiling like a predator seeking prey. If he had been up here, he would've been in a much better mood than the man. But, he didn't seem to notice much as he sat down on the other side of the bed and pulled out his wand. He had no qualms about using it, but he knew it was necessary. Even though it was a curse, he knew he could do what he wanted. The man was...  he was so out of it that he was willing to kill everyone he met in their small group. But, no matter how many times he tried, they had all ended up dead. He was just using the wand as a makeshift weapon. When he was finished with his unwanted death, the man grabbed his face and pulled his face into his hands, as if it had been a gift from the devil.

"Hermione," Harry whispered in fear, a voice he’d never hear."I’m sorry," the other said, his eyes hard.

"I’m so sorry."Hermione hesitated, allowing her tears to run freely. She wasn’t sure that she’d be able to say the same for herself, but it was better than knowing that this wasn’t the girl they’d been talking about for over a year."I’m sorry," she said, tears in her eyes.

"I’m so sorry every single time I thought I’d go and live with my parents and my family in a different country. You’re my parents, and you’re not my grandparents, so I can’t have that."



"I’ll take it," Hermione said, tears welling up in her eyes, "I’m a Muggleborn. I’m not allowed to live with my parents in the wizarding world. I’m not allowed to be a part of the Pureblood world. I’ll die trying."



Theo turned away and looked at her.

"You’re going mad," he said, leaning forward.

"You’re the only one that knows how I feel."In the silence that followed, she listened intently, analyzing everything that Blaise had told her. He had told her that he’d been the one who told her. That she was the one who thought she was the one who wanted to know. That she was the one who wanted to know. It always made things more interesting. He had said that he’d never have lied to her, but he’d been wrong the whole time. She knew this, and she knew that she was the one who fucked with him. Why else would he tell her that he wasn’t just a child anymore did," gave Professor Prince a knowing smile, "and he loves it. I’d like to hear what he does to you!"A few minutes later, they found themselves talking in the Common Room, the room filled with an eerie silence that told them nothing was going to happen here."What do you want to do?" asked a voice that meant more than words.The silence was so thick that they could hear only the whisper of what must have been footsteps."I want to go outside," whispered the redhead.

"I heard footsteps down the hall, it was a cold night."Professor Prince looked just as worried as she looked "Yes, I’m sure it’s a bit gross, but I’m sure it’s exactly the same as everything you’ve read about the Dark Lord’s cruelty."Professor Prince spoke in a very calm voice.

"He must’ve been surprised by your attempts to kill him."

"He did, of course, but there’s no need to be so dramatic in this."

"I’ve been impressed." He said, putting his arm around Hermione’s shoulders and pulling her closer.

"I hate a good fight."

"He is yours." She said, squeezing his hand.

"She would never hurt you."

"You’re the reason why I’m allowed to marry." Blaise said, throwing his arm around Hermione’s shoulders.

"You’re the only person that has the right to marry me. You’re the only one who can force her to marry you. You’re the only one who can just-"

"It’s what you want." Hermione gripped his arm even tighter.

"You don’t have to be my wife to be yours."She paused, eyes wide.

"You are mine. You don’t have to make me pay for what you did to me. You came here with my mother."Hermione, still freezing, looked up from the newspaper and saw the seal of the Wizengamot seal before her.

"Pomona," Pomona called, shaking her head."I’m going," Pomona said, walking out of the portrait and disappearing into the crowd."I’ll be back," Hermione said, finding herself unable to make out her friends’ names."What did you do to me?"

"I fell," asked Blaise, eyeing the fire in her eyes."I’m sorry," she said through a tear.

"I just didn’t know, and I’ll tell you when I can."

"I’m sorry too, but I need you to come with me," Pansy said with a smile.

"We’ll be there in the kitchen and we’ll be the perfect couple."Hermione felt tears prickle down her cheeks as she watched them go down. They looked so real, so real and yet so so full of life. They looked so alive, and yet they were so cold."We’ll bring palindromic flowers," Draco said, carrying the bouquet over to a table.  you want a bouquet of flowers from this table, do it."



Harry nodded respectfully, and a few went down to the front.Draco was wearing a pink polka dot pin and a pink flower ring with a silver bracelet. As the group went in, they were all looking at the two girls. One was red, and the other a blue. The pink pin was for Draco, while the blue pin was for Hermione. This was the first time that this had happened in the Manor.



"I’m sure that’s enough," Harry said with a smile.



"How do you feel about her?" Hermione asked breathlessly.



" sorry, I’m not sure. She’s not that bad. I’m sure she’s not your type." Hermione apologized without hesitation.

"I don’t know what to say to that." She smiled fondly.

"I think she’s beautiful." Hermione watched the two girls smile at each other and don’t want to argue with her. But, she couldn’t say how she felt about Draco Malfoy. It was enough of a jab to draw his attention. The two girls were sitting down on the sofa waiting for him to join them."I’m sorry for my tone of voice.
