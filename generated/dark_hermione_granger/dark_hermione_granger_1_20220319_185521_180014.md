What about the bat? I thought I was going to ask the bat what the hell it is. I hated the idea of her asking me to kill her or kill her myself. She probably would've been too sad for me. I don't know what she was thinking, but it felt good to do something that I don't think anyone would approve of. That way, I didn't have to kill her either. Now, I'm not just going to kill her, I'm going to kill her myself. I've been doing this for years, and while I don't trust the Dark Lord, I wasn't planning on it. Everyone has their own way of doing this, and I don't want to make it obvious. I want to listen, and you aren't going to let me out of here!"Hermione's face went pale as she stared at him, drawing strength from the words, "I'll be your prisoner, you know." He turned to her, and she turned back to face him, "You'll be fine." He turned to her, "I'll be your prisoner, I swear!" She turned to his face, and he turned to face her again, "I'll be fine. And you're not going to hurt me."

"I'll be fine?" She looked at him, "I'll be right there. Whatever happens, I promise you I'll get out of here and never let him use Severus again."

"I promise." He said, and she felt a rush of hope.

"I will find a way. I will find a way to get the Gryffindor boy out of the castle. I will find a way to get Severus out of the castle."

"That's your promise." She replied, tears filling her eyes.

"I promise."She hugged herself to her chest and tried to remember what she had said. The last thing she remembered was kissing Draco. Her eyes were unfocused. But she couldn't help but remember the feeling. When she left, she did it again, this time in a different room. Her hands and legs felt hot and soft, as though they were twenty feet away. She pushed past him and climbed back into Draco's lap.The feeling of Draco's warm hands on her skin was unlike any experience she had since first avoiding their relationship. Her lover seemed unbothered. He looked up at him, and she could see the intense blush in his eyes. She could feel his eyes on her, and she could feel his lips there too. It was like he was trying to make up for lost time.

"I don't need your help." He whispered, his eyes roaming the room for a second or two before settling back on her.

"I don't need any of it."

"You don't need me, love. Just tell me who the real spy is." Draco reached his hand out to touch her cheek.

"Let me guess, you do know who he is, but you're not mad. He's pretty. What can we do for you?"

"I don't know, I'm better with cats than with humans." Hermione said, as she sat down on the couch, putting her head on the arm of the sofa. In the next room she found the same cat that had terrorized the kitchen and had run there while she was drunk.

"I think I'm finally going to have to kill him, or at least try to, I don't know, to see if I can keep him out of my house. We're both in here."Hermione's eyes softened when she realized that it was quite obvious that he was trying to find her. The cat was a familiar looking black fluffy cat, but not a white fluffy one.She had to admit to herself that the cat looked a bit odd. It was a dog, she supposed, but a dog? She had never seen cats look so familiar.There were a few cat noises as she entered the kitchen of the Weasley house. They were all woven of grass and leaves. It sounded like a gentle breeze blowing. She reached into her bag and pulled out a small box. It was a small pain to open it, but she felt it when she did. A small box with a lid on top. It was slightly smaller than her own, but it was snug. She took the lid from under the lid and slid it into her hand. This was a silver knife. It was a long blade, almost like a stick. It was small, like a finger. There was a spot just behind the blade where the blade was. It was on the same spot on my left hand. It was sharp, like a knife. I took the knife, sliced it, and the knife went through the material. The blade was very sharp and very shiny. I took the knife out of the pocket and started to work. The cut was not a knife, but a dagger. It was a shallow cut. It went down like a dagger. I sliced the material with my knife, but not before I cut a good line. I added a couple of hairs on the blade, so it would not cut easily. The blade was dark silver, but the silver was not strong enough to cut straight through a child's clothing.

She looked at the blade in her hand. Before she took the blade, she did not care about the sharp edges, she cared about the strength. Without any doubts she cut through the clothing without cutting straight through. This was the genius of the battle. She did not care if the child's clothes were too big or too small.

She did not care if the child's clothes were too big or too small. This is what you should do. This is what you should do.

She did not dare to close her eyes. The fear was evident in her voice. She did not want to be the person that she was portrayed to be. She would not be a slave to her master, regardless of her blood status.She was patient, but she had to be careful what she did next. There was always a chance that it would all turn out as she thought it would. She was willing to be a prisoner. Because she was, after all, a person. And she was willing to do what was necessary to survive.Resuming her walk across the vegetable patch, she stopped by the front door. The temperature was still rising, and the cold air was filling her lungs with the steady and steady breath she exhaled. It was a strange feeling, like someone is still breathing. The steam that was coming from the fireplace was making her clench her fists in fear. She was afraid that if she was discovered and she was found guilty, the punishment would be harsh and she even more of a curse. No, what she wanted was to have her freeing, to have her being cuddled in her arms for a long time, and she knew it wouldn't be in her best interests to do that."Why should I care if she has to sleep in there?"

"Sleeping in there is considered a Curse, but it is not as if she has to remain awake to do anything."Her voice was soft and calming, more like a prayer. She was in a better place. It was a comforting comfort, and it was like a light breeze. Everything she did was done, and she was the only one left. Her mind was still on the conversation she'd had with Blaise, and she had no idea how she was supposed to answer it.

"Don’t be ridiculous. I’ve been through enough." Hermione sighed, the words spilling out before she even knew what was going on.

"The first time I met Voldemort, I didn’t know what happened, so I went straight to him." Hermione paused and turned her gaze to the room behind her.

"Well, I suppose I was expected to be killed."

"Oh, I’ll tell you everything." Hermione nodded.

"You’re the teacher, aren’t you?" Ginny asked."Yes." Ginny’s eyes glinted.

"I’m the same age as you, she’s between the ages of six and seven."The twins shook their head in unison."She’s not a student. I think we are." Hermione said."You know who a teacher is, don’t you?" Ginny asked."Not me." Ginny’s eyes lit up.

"I’m Hermione Granger. I’m the Professor of Divination."They looked at each other."You were." Hermione smiled.

"Thank you. I’m afraid I’m not able to teach you exactly how to talk to snakes."Hermione nodded.

"Yes, well, you know that."

"I did." She nodded.

"I’ll see what I can do."Hermione took a step back, but Draco did not move.

"I understand." He said, taking a step forward and gesturing for her to follow him. Draco did not move."Very well. I’ll see what I can do." Hermione smiled.There was a moment of silence before Draco moved to stand behind her."I was just about to say I’m sorry," Draco said, his tone sharp."I’m sorry," Hermione said, feeling slightly embarrassed."I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to sound so... like a... " Hermione trailed off, eyes darting around to meet Hermione’s, and then back to Draco."I’m so sorry, I swear," Draco said."But I’m not crying yet," Hermione said, feeling very awkward."Oh, you’re not." He said, holding up his hand.

"You can’t be crying, you’re my son, you have to be better than this!"He pulled out his wand to summon a still dark abyssal mirror.

"Merlin, what happened to that mirror?" he asked, trying to figure out who did it."I think it’s on your neck," said Hermione, shaking her head.

"You know, the one that I got rid of when I went to Azkaban."

"I think you’re my son," he said, looking at her with an unreadable expression.

"What happened to it?"

"I’m sorry," she said, sounding very apologetic.

"I so sorry I didn’t know what the potion was."Theo, Blaise and Draco all hugged her tightly, and she said, "I think we all need to know that we are all precious and precious," before turning to the next section of the boardroom.

"Will you be coming back here on Saturday to talk to me?"

"Of course, let’s go now," Theo said, sitting down and walking to Pansy’s room.

"I’ll be there for you soon." Using a 2D wand, he cast the spell that was being spoken about, causing the two twins to laugh and wave their w "It really is a beautiful piece of art, if nothing else."

"It is," Luna said, her eyes bright red.

"It was here when you found the diary," Draco said with a smile.

"I remember it, really." Hermione stood up, walking over to them.

"I know." She hugged them, tears of anger taking over.

"It just...  the bond between us was stronger than I ever expected." She hugged Draco back, causing them to laugh.

"The bond between us was stronger than I had ever expected," Draco said, his voice low.

"I know," Hermione said, her voice dripping with tears.

"I had thought he was as good as an idiot—if not better."Pansy pulled Draco out of the broom closet and helped him sit on the floor.

"What?" she asked, looking at him.

"You wanted to see him, didn’t you?"Draco gave her a weak smile.

"Yes, I did," he said, his voice still soft.

"He’s beautiful, but his hair is rather long. It is not suitable for anything else, but he is a good man."

"Fine," Hermione said.

"I’ll see how you like him, but I’m quite tired of his constant begging."

"I’ll just do my best," Pansy said.

"He’ll be all right after a few hours."Hermione hummed in agreement.

"I’ll be sure to meet him in one of the kitchens as well." She added.

"I’ll miss him."She was right. There was no reason to rush off into another lecture on her weakened professor’s inability to keep a conversation going and not have it interrupt it. Hermione watched Pansy and Hermione interact with each other as they got ready to depart for the kitchens. They didn’t return until they were already very close to the coast.

 Theo and Blaise were staying at a secluded island off the coast of Brazil when they heard a heavy crash from their direction. They quickly rushed to the nearest villa, only to be met by the sight of two bodies lying in a river.Theo and Blaise followed their trail, quickly catching up with one another as it took them a while to find what they were looking for. He reached out and started to light a cigarette, but when he didn’t see anything, he knew it was a fake. He was just opening the pack, so no one else could light it. Theo opened it, then lit the ash in the room. It was a simple white flame, but it lit the room as well.Draco was watching him, and he knew that he could use his arm to light the room. He opened the ash and put it in a small cauldron, and inhaled slowly. He lit the cauldron and put it on his head. He lit the room, and it smelled like him.Draco opened his mouth for a coughing fit, but his eyes opened as he felt his throat closing, the pressure building up and taking him by surprise. He closed it and he was finally free of this man’s curse."What the hell are you doing here?" He shouted."What?" he shouted back.Draco watched his reaction from a distance and nodded.

"It’s not the first time I’ve been forced to live in a manor of trees." He said."There’s always a manor of trees in Hogwarts."

"You’re a witch. And a wizard." he shouted."A wizard." he said again."A manor." he added.

"I’ve heard you say all the time that I look like a devil in a witch’s clothes."

"Draco, I’m not a devil. Just a woman." she said."You’ not the devil. You’re a human. You’re part of the witch. I’m your human."She said it to be sure that Draco would hear it. He did. He watched the blonde woman’s hair and her eyes for a while, then looked at the blonde woman again. She smiled brightly and said a final goodbye to Draco."I don’t know what to answer to."

"You mean to say that you love me."

"What do you mean by that?"

"I love you."She smiled at him and he walked out of the manor. He returned to the manor a second after that No one wanted to be the one to go after the Dark Lord, so they all stayed.The woman’s eyes were painted with a kind of emerald green. She was sitting on the side of a large wooden palatial throne. She was covered in a long, golden ribbon that wrapped around her waist and rested against her back. The woman was very thin, but she looked so elegant, so it was easy to see how lovely she was. There was a book of herbology in her lap that she was reading, and she was leaning on it, her hands playing at a bit of slow motion."I’ve been reading," Hermione said quietly.

"I don’t know what you trying to say, but it’s starting to spread. You’ve never been a bookworm before, do you? Do you know what you’re supposed to say?"

"I don’t know," Hermione said with a sigh.

"I’m not particularly into books."She put a hand on her forehead.

"Malfoy, please. You can’t be a bad influence on me, or even Draco. I would never do anything to him."

"I’m not sure," he said, looking at her worryingly.
