Her exposed breasts bouncing up and down.



"I just fainted," Harry whispered.



He and Draco stayed silent, waiting for the Potion Master’s response.



"If you meekly accept my fate, do not give up so easily, Harry," Draco said in a whisper.



Harry and Draco stood up and left the room, leaving the three of them alone.



"What do you want?" Draco asked as they walked to the manor.



The manor was dark in color, and the two of them were wearing the same silk button-up.



"I want you to have my body."



Draco smirked, starting to walk forward and rubbing the skin of the other’s neck, causing the blonde to gasp in shock. He ran his hand through his hair, the other quickly following through and covering the other’s neck. Draco was pleased to see that he and Draco were still apart.



"What the hell do you think you're doing? You’re a Malfoy, you’re a Death-Eater etcetera." Draco smirked.



"Order me to show you how to kill her." Draco ordered.



"You’re a Death-eater, you filthy Malfoy." Draco smirked.



"I’ll kill her Draco said in a low voice.

"I’m a Malfoy."

"You’re a Death-eater, I can’t kill her." Draco scoffed.

"But I’m fine with that, I don’t mind that." He gestured towards the white wolf sitting on the side.

"But I’m a Malfoy."

"You’re a Death-eater, I’m a Malfoy." Draco said.

"So what is it? You’re a Malfoy, a Malfoy." She gasped, filling them in.

"You’re a Malfoy Lucius bowed deeply behind her.



"I’m going to kill you, Snape." She said loudly.



Snape’s eyes went wide as he watched her.



"No, that’s not what I want." He said in a low voice.



Snape’s body shuddered, but he did not move.



"So, you’re going to kill me?" She asked, still looking unimpressed.



"I didn’t even think about it." Harry sat up quickly, pulling his chair back.



"You don’t think that we will be able to find the entrance after all the work is done? You don’t think that we will leave us here in a state to die in? You don’t think that we will be able to stay?" Blaise asked."I think we will be able to stay," Pansy said firmly."I think we will!" Draco said loudly."It is not a question of whether you will or not," Harry said in a very childish voice."You can’t ask me that." Harry snorted."I think if we have a good plan we can find the girls first." Harry said while walking back to his dorm.

"I don’t know how it would work but you two have chemistry." Ron said.

"That is good for us." Harry nodded excitedly.

"And we would be safe if we cast two phoenixes." Draco added.

"That is perfect and it is a Gryffindor secret." Hermione said grinning.

"Who would cast two phoenixes then?" Harry asked grinning.

"You can’t believe it!" Draco said laughing.

"I have never seen such a prank in my whole life." Harry said grinning.

"It is so funny!" said Hermione.

"That world? I’m going to get you to run off with your parents in the Pets!" Harry snapped.

"It is, you are lucky you have the right father." she said grinning."It is? Then what do I have to do?" Harry asked."I’ll have you come with me," she said smiling.

"I’ll help you find a place to live," Harry said smiling."It was just a dream!" said Hermione.

"Well that’s true, but I’ll never do it!" she said grinning.

"It is so good to see you so happy! It makes me feel so much better and makes me care so much more." He looked down at her and her hand trembled in shock, her eyes were wide with terror.

"What?" she asked straining to hold back her tears.

"It is a sign of love!" She cried out as she cried herself to sleep, her body shutting down and turning to black and spinning again.

"I love you Hermione," he whispered as he stood up from the bed, his grey eyes were wide and cold as night.

"I love you too," she cried softly.

"I love you too," he whispered as he stood back up again, his breath coming out and hard as he was.

"I’ll be in your debt, you know. I’ll not make it as long as you keep it up." He turned back to Hermione and began to whisper.

"I’ll make a deal, if you promise not to harm the other." He turned back to the portraits and started to walk away.

"I think I’ll take extra care," he whispered."I don’t know what you’re doing," Hermione said.

"I just wanted to make sure you’re alright and not to be seen as a threat to your family." She was starting to sound like Draco, but he’d stopped her when he realized she was staring."What’s the matter, my dear?" Hermione turned her back on the window.

"I was going to, um, see my father."

"I was going to, but he’s already gone." Hermione rolled her eyes and took a step back.

"What’s wrong, Draco?"

"I’m trying to get some sort of information, and I’m not sure what to do." She bit her lip.

"I guess I just need your help."He looked at her for a moment longer before asking: "You want to go to the castle?"Hermione was taken aback by his question. She’d never heard of a castle, never heard of a wizard’s workshop, and never’d seen a teacher manage anything...  except for a few short works of art. She had never heard of a teacher, and it was rare that they could be found."I don’t know," she said.

"I’ve never seen a teacher manage anything at all."

"No worries, Granger. You’ll have plenty of time to manage your own work."She felt a sudden rush of excitement.

"You’re the first to win," she said, looking up at him.

"The Centaur’s in the kitchen."Hermione’s heart skipped a beat. Whoever the spy was, they’ll never know.

"What do you want?" he asked in a calm voice."I can’t see anyone with any sort of control over the whole of Hogwarts," she said.

"And I don’t see anyone looking at them."

"But they’ve all been watching you."

"I do."

"What do they? They can’t see us and we’re not a threat to them. He looks around.

"Our people are ignorant, they don’t know anything, and it’s very dangerous to use magic against us."

"I believe I’m right, but I’m not the only one who feels the same."

"No, no, I think I’m right. I’m not the only one, but I think it’s the only one." Tom nods and walks out the door.

"The Order will help!" I am thankful for the idea. Tom opens the door and the room is filled with the sound of a baby crying.

"I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time." Bellatrix pulled the baby out of the room and sat it down on the seat next to it.

"I feel so safe that I would not have the courage to take you to see a live baby." She said passionately.

"I feel safe knowing that you will not be attacked." The baby’s mother spoke softly.

"I can’t, Hermione. You are my responsibility. I’m your responsibility. I can’t do anything that would make you afraid."

"I know, you are right, and I’m not afraid of snakes. But I want you to know that snakes are not safe. I don want you to show my love to a snake. I want you to believe me when I say that I am your enemy."There was a rush of anger and one that she stood ready to fight back, but she stopped herself before they were as close as they could get.

"I've got to get back, Granger. I need to get out of this building. I need to get out of here. I need to get out of here."She didn't understand what he was trying to say, but it was the middle of the night."I'm sorry, I swear. I'm not your enemy, Granger. I just need to get out of here as quickly as possible. I'm going to order a Healer to remove your wand and you're going to have to prove you're not mentally broken."Thorfinn stifled a laugh.

"I think I too am."Theo was already leaving the room, heading up to the window.

"I can't believe someone as ridiculous as you were scared off, mate."

"That's what I thought, Oi."Theo turned and left, heading up the stairs.Narcissa was ready to wade into the arms of the mirror and see if she could ever shut it down as she started to do so. She's a witch, after all... To be honest, I didn't really think much about her until the very end. As it so happens, she was the only person in the entire Lestrange family to share her need for a love story. It was a terribly freeing experience, and filled with dread that she might not ever be able to say the same for her mother.She moved from the living room, unsure what to do next. There was no reason to be in that room. She had a purpose for being there, a purpose for making the first move. It was time to go to bed. Hermione needed to get out of the house and back to the room she had been in since they first night. She already knew that the house-elf was in the process of coming back to the kitchen to help her clean the dishes. She should have been in the kitchen before. As soon as she was in the kitchen, she'd take a long bath and then return to her room."Is it because of me? Because of you?" Pansy asked."No, of course not," Hermione said.

"I’m just here because I’m sick."Hermione nodded in understanding. She knew that she’d have to talk to her parents, but couldn’t possibly be lying about something as important as that.

"I can’t be sure," she assured her, despite the fact that she was relieved to know that her parents weren’t lying to her.

"I’ll be sure to tell them when you’ not in a relationship," she said as if that was the last thing on her mind.

"You’re in a relationship with Draco, right?" She looked up from where she had her hands on her wand.

"I’m sure he’s better than Lucius," she said without meaning it, but she knew she could tell if someone was lying.

"I’m sure he’s better than you, Hermione," she said with a smile.

"I’ve seen the Wizard’s tried to kill you. He’s the best, Granger." She watched Draco with a smile that was the exact opposite of what he expected, maybe he was just flirting with her. Maybe she was just trying to have fun. It just seemed like a wonderful idea.He reached across the small table to pat her palm lightly, the touch so much warmer than the warmth he was using. When he finally pulled away, he was surprised to find that she was already wearing a simple - perhaps even too simple - dress.He looked up at her in shock and disappointment and then back at him in a rush of both shock and happiness.

"What is this dress, Hermione? My dress," he swallowed heavily, his shoulders swelling in confusion.

"It's my dress."

"I might as well call it a day's work, eh? Yes, you're right about that. We've got a new assistant coming in at the moment, think we can all work on that together?"

"Well, get a room, you don't have to come with us. You'll find a room in the old house, right by the staircase. And, I don't think I need any assistance whatsoever."Draco's hand squeezed his girlfriend's shoulder, and his lips pressed a little harder in her direction.

"See you in a little while, 'Mione? I'm sure your mum would like that."Hermione didn't like the way Draco looked at her; she knew, at least from the way he spoke, that she was a bit cold. She took a deep breath, and forced her thoughts from their thoughts of the past day."Oh, my dear, I’m half-past that hour! You’re the light of the day!" The tears streaming down her cheeks. She heard the sound of a baby crying, and was quickly pulling back the covers."Baby?" She whispered."Yes, my dear, it is." She looked at Draco."I’ve been looking forward to this last few hours. But in the end, I’m not so happy about it. Please tell me this isn’t just a one-night-stand," Draco whispered."I’m sorry," Hermione said.  can I say that? I mean, Draco’s not a wizard, and this is my house, so I can’t just casually go into hiding. I have to leave for a week if that’s even possible."

"You won’t be able to leave for a week," Draco said.

"You’ll have to go into the woods. You’ll have to go out into the forest."Hermione nodded.

"Absolutely," she said.

"But I don’t want to go into the woods. If I’m there, it’s a three-way street, and I’ll be there."Hermione’s eyes lit up. She wanted to see the look in Malfoy’s eyes when he said the words. He was the aristocratic kind, she thought, and he seemed proud of it. He looked at her, and his face went pale.

"Sorry. I’m afraid I’m not the right sort for you." She said with a smile, then sighed and shook her head.

"I don’t know. I wish I could help you."



There was a time when Hermione thought that the Order was in strong hands. They’d been on the defensive and outnumbered. Now, they were taking the lead. The light force of a group of light could take the lead if they focused enough.

"They are coming!" Narcissa called out, and the commotion started again. The Gryffindors and Slytherins took the lead, throwing spells and setting up wards to keep the enemy out. The Gryffindors were the first to break the perimeter, and Narcissa cast a shield charm to keep the other three at bay. The Dark Lord's men were within sight, and they were firing on the army with blinding speed.The Gryffindors were outnumbered, and the lightest force of any of the light allied with them was able to take the lead. Draco was the first to break through the shields, and he did so using a sword of Damocles. Whenever Hermione acted very deliberately, it was the same. He chose to do her chores as a reminder to keep a balance between the aggression that she was known for and the coolness that she was known for."You're too much of a person, Hermione. How do you feel now?"

"I don't feel like I'm able to do what I want anymore."

"Well you're not."She wanted to argue that her actions were wrong, but Draco interrupted her with a firm grip on her arm.

"You're not a bad person." He stood tall and lifted his arm up."What? You don't care about me?"

"Not anymore. I'm not the same person I was before you hurt me. I'm not the person I was before you attacked me. You're a monster."

"What?" She glared at him again, but he was angry enough to rise from his seat and walk out of the room.

"You know me? I'm not the type of person you want to hurt."

"She's right. Do you want to leave? I'm willing to stay here." He grabbed her hands and pulled her closer to him, leaving her in a comical embrace.

"I love you."She loved him, but she couldn't bear the cold feelings. They both hated the feelings.It was an overabundance of comfort that she didn't understand at first. They would do anything for each other, and they both would.
