A week before the end of the school year, the Daily Prophet printed a letter from a student, Gilderoy Lockhart, to the students at Hogwarts. The letter had been addressed to Gilderoy Lockhart by Professor Walburga Abbott, Head of Educational Studies for Hogwarts. The letter had been carefully worded by Walburga herself, and the title had said it all:The letter had also mentioned that Lockhart was a member of the Black family, as was the name Gabbard. The second part of the letter had left a bad taste in my mouth.Gilderoy Lockhart was a very interesting man. He was intelligent and kind, and a good friend of the founders of Hogwarts, as well as her former classmate, the late great Albus Dumbledore. What would your father be like? Were you raised in a strict, magical world, or were you raised in a more modern world?"Hermione was being tailed by her father. They had been talking, and she could tell that he was trying to bestow a sense of comfort on her, and perhaps a sense of responsibility. He had been so easy to talk to, and so forth. Her father had been supportive, and she felt too left out of the action."How will you be involved in the newly established school? Do you have a choice?"

"I have no choice, Hermione. I have to. I'm a Hufflepuff. I'm allowed to become a Qu player. I want to be a Slytherin. I want to be a Ravenclaw. I want to be a Muggle-born. I have to be able to return to school. I want to have a normal life. I want to live my dream. I want to be a Princess, a Muggle-born, and be able to raise my family. I need to be able to raise my own magical core. I am the only one in all of this.This is my version of reality, I am a Muggle-born and a Princess. I am a Princess.

Heartsick man and alcoholic, Hermione was at the edge of his seat, that's why she's not talking, she's talking about a girl who was a professor in her year at Hogwarts. They were both in her year and were making sure her friends were good."I’m Draco Malfoy," he said, smiling up at her.

"And your name is Luna Lovegood, you’re the only pureblood girl in my year."He stopped her laughing, and came back to himself, still smiling.

"Luna," he said.

"You can’t say anything to Draco, he’s a good friend of mine and my mother, and as long as he’s not my friend, I’m really friends with him."

"I didn know," Hermione said.

"I was just reading a book and I was thinking about you and Draco."She should have told him that, but he wouldn’t have told her, so she didn’t ask.Rather than admit, she just walked away."I’ll tell you later," Narcissa said, her voice a whisper.Hermione stepped into the study and closed the curtains. Her eyes were wide and glassy and she looked up from a book in her lap, which was also contained in her lap."What do you want to talk about?" Narcissa asked."I’m going to the Christmas Ball," Hermione said.

"I’ve been meaning to ask about it for months."

"I can’t! I need to do it myself!"

"You’re my father! You may not have even known me yet, but I love you so much, that I thought I could-" Narcissa’s voice was full of tears.

"I know, but I can’t- I just want to visit you!"Hermione stopped in her tracks and ran her fingers through her hair.

"Hermione, you can’t. You’re my father."She turned her head to stare at Hermione, who was grinning like an idiot "You're going to kill me too!" she said, her fingers squeezed the wand tightly around Draco's neck.

"I don't want that, not yet." Hermione smiled, her back to Draco's side. They had a few moments of silence before the sharp sound of a door opening hit them.Hermione felt like she was on a sinking feeling. She knew that she would get tortured. More than once since the first time that she had ever been in her room, she had to remind herself to not show it to anyone. But, she couldn't relax. The news was still bad, because the Dark Lord had ordered that she be tortured until he died. She didn't want that anymore. She just wanted to die.There was a time when she could go out there and enjoy the sun shining through the windows while they waited for a new Order member to join the others. The Dark Lord rarely needed new members. The ones who were not in the Inner Circle because they were under the control of one could only hope that the Dark Lord could find another to lead their side. The Dark Lord was known to prefer the House that had the most blood on their hands. It was easy to see why they would bring a great deal of pride to their leader. Hermione couldn't bear to be without him again. The last time she was truly alone with him at home was long ago. He would bathe in his own blood, if only to help him to forget his past and bring clarity to the wizarding world. The one trait the Slythers inherited from their Father’s grandfather was their idealistic idealism. Harry would never go that route again. So many years of Tom’s life, that those that truly believed in the pureblood ideal were unable to achieve it. Harry didn’t like the idea of the Malfoys having any power whatsoever. That was a myth!"I don’t want to be a part of that!", Harry suddenly heard the sound of his mother’s voice.

"I’d rather have the Dark Lord allow me to raise my family."

"Then you’re a traitor!", he growled.

"You’ll never learn!"And he did. The Longbottom family was ruined and their son Lucius was a walking trophy.Theo smirked, his face as though he were the devil himself.

"You’re right," he said, "I’m the Dark Lord’s son. And you, Draco, have been a figurehead for the Dark Lord’s forces for far too long. That’s why you’re the worst of the bunch."

"I’m the Dark Lord’s child,", he said, as he strode forward and placed a pair of herbology books before the fireplace.

"You have all decided to join me for a tea party?"

"Yes." Hermione nodded.

"It's a lovely way to spend an evening."

"No!" Draco exclaimed, "It's not like I could stand this."Hermione reached for her wand and pulled it out, which was now a luminous blue pearl-handled leather bag. It was a beautiful silver bracelet with a diamond inlay.

"I didn't mean to ask."

"You're going to work on this for me." Draco said with a smirk, "Go have tea and relax, okay?"

"I'm not going to." She said with a smirk.

"I just need to watch your fingers and not worry about it."

"Why are you doing that?"

"Because I want you to, Hermione. I owe you my life. I want you to love me, and I want to protect you from harm."

"Hermione, don't you want to go to Hogwarts?"

"Yes, I don't. But I don't want to go to the library. I want to watch my teacher play with the quidditch pitch. I haven't the faintest idea who we'll be playing against, and that's why I'm teaching Muggle Studies. I wanted to ask you to start sometime, but I don't have the time."Hermione sighed and stepped closer to the kitchenette.

"I still have a little bit of Quidditch Practice to do, but I'll take it up to the castle, and then home."

"I don’t know what you’re talking about," Hermione said slowly.

"I don’t think I’ll ever get to see the whole old family."She turned to leave, her eyes narrowed as she moved further into the castle. Hermione went down the stairs, feeling very exposed. It was the only way to get her to leave. She picked up the book which had been stolen from the wall and walked up to the kitchen. She had to try to read it before she left.Hermione gasped as she began to read it, her eyes starting to adjust. The old woman’s eyes were a strange sort of blue, and she looked like an angel. She’d been so afraid at the sight of her, that she’d been incapable of making her feel any better.The other woman’s hair was waves of white, messy, and a natural part of her. It looked as though she’d been born with a bush on her head. Her face was more of an upturned hat than anything, having been painted dark red to match the rest of the man’s. She had her eyes wide open and a wicked grin on her face."I’d never seen you like this," the old woman said.Hermione could have sworn that she’d been speaking to the ghost of Lucius Malfoy, and that it was somehow physically impossible for a man to be seen as a ghost.

"I am sure your father has heard," he said, sounding as though he was speaking of the Chamber of Secrets.

"In a word, he’s in need of a potion. It’s quite expensive, I think, but you could be getting one of those."

"Is that Lucius?" she asked cautiously.

"I’ve never heard of him, but he’s responsible for the Chamber, and has done a good job there." He shrugged."You’re not the only one who knows of the Chamber," Bellatrix warned."You’re right," she said.

"I suspect you’ll be watching the Chamber for anyone who might attempt to sneak in." She trailed off.

"I’ll be watching for the occasional basilisk or a patrolling basilisk-like creature."

She stayed quiet for a bit longer. It was the last thing she’d need after the ordeal in the bathroom. Even if Draco was only a slightly less insidious Death Eater, she had to admit that this was still worse than what The Order and their Death Eaters had done.

The Longbottom Manor had been rebuilt a century ago with the help of the Malfoy family.
 she said."This is a distraction, I’m not the only one who got distracted," Draco said, his voice still cowering, his hands on his hips and his face as if trying to not laugh.

"I’m sorry."

"I didn’t mean it," she said.

"You’re clever, Granger," she said, mirroring his.

"And I’m not much, but you’re not terrible."

"I’ll admit that I am. I could’ve done worse," he said. She felt her eyes narrow.

"Did you know I don’t have to keep an eye on you, or just give you a blank list of people to follow?"The only person she knew to follow was Hydrus. She almost didn’t know him, but neither one of them seemed to know much about the other. He was quite oblivious to her existence aside from being the only person she knew who got all of the information in the letters. If it weren’t for his friendship with Draco, she would have assumed that he would have been kept away at least a little."This isn’t a secret," Hydrus said.

"I just have to see if Draco’s jealousies are worth sharing." Harry interrupts.

"He’s not jealous, he’s horny. I can see him wanting to have sex with his girlfriend."

"Say it louder, you pureblood prince," Hermione says in a weak voice.

"You are such a know-it-all. You want to hear it all?"

"Yes, I do. I love hearing it all," Harry laughs.

"Say it more. Do you even want to hear it?" Draco asks.

"No," Harry says softly.

"It’s fine, I just don know what’s going on."Draco raises his head.

"I’m not sure, but the way he handles it is amazing." He looks around, looking around the room he finds two portraits in the corner of the room.He nods.

"I’m the one who sets the rules, Harry."

"You’re the one who set the rules, Harry." Draco says in a bookish voice.

"I can’t wait to see what you have to say."Harry looks up, but Draco remains silent. Both portraits stare in shock.

"Who is the girl from the library?" Draco asks. as pretty as the rest of us. We all sit down and he starts to explain that we are going to have dinner tonight." We all nod and wait for him to say anything else.

"What has the whole school been up to?" I ask.

"Nothing, we just received the news from the Order."

"We are safe now."

"Why?" I ask.

"We were all caught up in the meeting about some Quidditch match."

"The whole Order is watching us. We are getting our information and everyone is waiting for the information."

"Why?" I ask.

"We are all watching." He nods.

"We used to be all the time."

"I don’t know why we used to be on the lookout for information."

"We were all just children, I mean." We look at each other. We are all waiting for the information.

"The Dark Lord wants to be the next Dark Lord, he is the head of the Gryffindor team."

"You don’t think he would notice that the three Gryffindors and two Hufflepuffs were protected, we are children and he doesn’t know what we are capable of."

"If I could to choose a side, I agree to take the Dark Lord." I laugh, his eyes are watching everything.

"Which is why we’re sharing an office in the most lawless of places."

"The office of the Dark Lord?" I ask, curiosity getting the best of me.

"The Dark Lord’s office is the headquarters of the Unspeakables, he’s the one who runs the Unions." I nod.

"We are all the same."

"But we are the same."

"Always. The dragon’s our name."

"We were." I nod.

"He was. My parents are missing. I remember how he was at the wedding." I imagine how angry he must have been and how upset he must’ve been.

"I’m fine. I’m fine. We’re fine." I nod again.

"We’re not."

"We are." I repeat the words.

"I’m fine. Just do what you have to." I walk further into the kitchen.

"I’m sorry I left you waiting until we were alone. I wanted to walk back to the house and pick up the dagger. It was all a waste of time."

"Don’t you dare to compare us to the worst of the daft," Blaise scoffed.

"You know the type." Pansy snorted.

"You’re the one who said we were daft," she added.

"A slippery bunch." Draco groaned.

"But you’re the only one who thought we were daft." Pansy shook her head.

"If you were, you would’ve told."

"I’d never told you!" she said with a raised eyebrow.

"You knew that all along." Blaise snorted.

"It was all a big lie. A lie that we’ll never get from you." Theo shrugged.

"I know you." Pansy nodded.

"You know what else to do?" Theo asked.

"Tell them everything." Pansy nodded.

"They will only hear about the spell, not who taught it, or how it was done." She smirked.

"I told them it was a lonely Creevey, after all." Theo said.

"I couldn’t believe it was you, you lied about us." Draco snorted.

"Couldn’t have done it worse." He continued.
