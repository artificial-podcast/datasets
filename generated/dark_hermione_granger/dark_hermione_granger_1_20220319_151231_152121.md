"Great a Bi-Polar House Elf," Hermione said.

"A good start."She looked at the cluster of chairs, each of which had a large chart. She had been watching the color change in the group as they sat. The color was a dull, pale, and mostly yellowish-gray. The top was yellow, and the bottom red. Hermione felt a tug at her heart as her eyes adjusted and she saw the color shift. She shivered and pulled her hand away, but it didn't seem to hurt."It's a House Elf," she said, and then she pulled a small teapot from her satchel and put it back in her bag.

"I was hoping to find a more permanent solution than the regular colored teapot I've used, but it's better. If I was a tea party goer and wanted help with that, I would."Hermione was glad to hear that the potions professor was a wizard.

"I had to work on that for a few days after you told me about my potions, but I couldn't tell you what you used."

"Well, what are you going to do about that?"

"I already told you that I would protect you and your family if you kept this a secret. You have been under constant stress ever since you lost your parents."She sighed and gestured to her bag.

"What can I do for you, Hermione? I thought I was safe."Lavender's eyes were blazing with anger.

"What in God's name do you think you're doing? You're so naive, you thought you would always be safe, but you're actually making it worse."

"You're not making it worse? You're hiding it behind your façade and nothing more? You still have your little moment of sanity? What's the point of telling me, if I'm going to be safe?"

"You're not making it worse? You're hiding it?"

"I'm not making it better, you know. You have to be careful, Lavender."

"I'm not just telling you this anymore. You're not expecting me anymore."

"I am. I'm just interested. You are my friend, Hermione. You're mine."

"No, I'm not. I just don't think you're even worth the friendship."She didn't want to see him in a relationship. Even if she didn't hate him for it, she knew that his feelings for her were just as hurtful. After all, she had always known him to love her. Part of her had been afraid that she would never see the day that she would come out and say the words she'd been speaking about for years."Don't you ever get angry at me for saying those words. I was fighting for my life and I didn't mean them. I was just saying them."

"Did you really say them?"

"No, but I did. It's such a shock that you would make such a comment about me not meaning them or even considering them I can’t look up, I am not very good at deciphering nonsense." the other man stuttered."What?" he asked."Why do you have to say so many words?" Hermione asked."I have no idea. I just had a feeling." he said in a hushed whisper.

"What is it?"

"Well, it’s a mystery. I hope you don’t have any other questions." she said."I’ve never had a mystery before." he said quickly.A few hours later Hermione was in the dining room with Draco and Theo, sitting down in their respective seats. Draco stood on the last seat with Theo. His eyes met mine and I could see his expression.

"Hi," he said.

"Will you come, Father?" I nodded.

"I can see the dining room, and I can see you and Narcissa's room." Draco walked into the dining room and sat down. A new piece of furniture appeared and Narcissa came to the table.

"What is it?" Narcissa asked.

"It's a bracelet, it's an attachment, and it will accept your wand, wand-staff, ring, ring-staff, wand-staff, and wand-staff charms." He looked at it for a moment but then he stopped in his tracks.

"It is powerful and held my attention for a very long time, and then I felt it... the power."He was confused at her words.

"It feels like magic, but it is cold. I have never felt cold at home in this house, I don't like it. Would you feel that if I handed you this, would you?" His tone was harsh but calm.

"I don't know, I don't know, I plan on staying until I see Severus."His eyes were cold and dark.

"What are you planning to do when you are alone?" His eyes were as dark as his hair.

"I already lost you, Malfoy. I can't bear this. I can't live with myself for a year, maybe two." She would not accept this. They would not be friends."No, Antonin, you're right. I'm not that much of a fool. I know a man by blood, and I won't go looking for him. I just want to be at my best and be with my daughter and son.

" She hesitated for a few more moments.

"...  yeah?"

"Okay, but I think it's best if we go out together." Ginny's breath hitched in her throat, demanding to know what she was saying. Hermione nodded and left the room, dropping Antonin's hand in the doorframe."I wouldn't mind if you came here with me." Ginny smiled and made her way to the kitchen, opening the door in her small way and welcoming her immediately into the house. The man's eyes were dark, like the moon, but it was comforting and comforting, she knew that. He came over and put his arm around her. She leaned down to kiss him. There was so much to explore.Hermione felt a small pang of guilt go through her as she felt so much more than the guilt she felt when she was pregnant with Draco's father. She was so different from him. Maybe that is why she was attracted to him so much. He was cute and a little bit arrogant, but at the same time he had a purpose. He was her friend. He was the first person she had ever known who had a heart to open and understand. Without his feelings, she didn have the courage to go through with the torture. What would she have to do? She never imagined that she would."I was so worried when I saw you in the mirror, Hermione. I didn't take much for granted. I was naïve and it was all I knew. I missed you."He chuckled, but didn't show it. Her eyes were glassy and she couldn't see the disgusted look on his face. She grabbed his hands and held them close. A cold grip was as much a barrier between them as a silvery blanket. They both knew that they were doomed.



Antonin's lips were on Hermione's. The last night of her life was never simple. She was afraid that it would all go downhill from there. And she knew that she wouldn't have enough strength for a mission like this without Draco. She had to be strong. Weak. She'd been foolish enough to trust him. A part of her wanted to shield her from the danger she found herself in, but that didn't mean she wanted to be vulnerable in his arms. The other was afraid to look his best. She had to be brave to look her best."Yes, well, maybe not to the one who held you up there."He was right, but she also didn't want to look Draco in the eye when she looked out the window. It was too dark for any of them to be asleep. Hermione didn't have to worry about the possibility of seeing them again, they could be gone forever.



The door opened as Hermione walked through the corridor, the sound of their footsteps growing louder and more shrill as she went. She didn't know how long she'd been gone, she also didn't know what kind of person she'd been in the past so long. The only thing that seemed right was to go back in time to what she'd just experienced.



They were still standing in front of her door when she heard a soft voice from behind her. She turned around and saw Draco walking out of the room, his eyes alight with a renewed desire.



He was dressed in black and with a silver mirror in his hand, quite pale and bare, his face a stark contrast to the rest of the room."I was hoping to see you," he drawls.

"I’m so sorry and sorry I couldn’t get into the room."The door is opened.

"It’s time for your wedding, Prince," he announces.

"A grand ballroom overlooking the Thames and gardens, complete with live entertainment, a spectacular fountain, and a bridal party for the Most Ancient and Noble House of Malfoy."Hermione was surprised to see such a sweeping change. They had expected something more expensive and extravagant from the groom, but it was more than just a wedding. The bride was draped in a green shoulder-length dress and had a veil, a corset, and a stern bow. Her hair was white as snow, and the bride was seated on a massive floating chair.



What a beautiful day it is to wear the colors of my hair!



She had a warm, corset, and a stern bow on her head.



How did you know it was me?



"I’m Hermione Granger."



Hermione wasn’t just like her. She was outgoing, friendly, and had a lot of fun. She didn’t have to be to notice her own husband’s expression. She was overly serious, which was a great trait for girls.



"I sorry, Hermione, I’m worried about your emergency communication with Ginny right now? I don’t know what she said to Susan or what she did, but I’m sure she’s doing some serious damage control." Lucius’s face went pale.

"You’re worried about your love for Ginny?"Hermione swallowed, realizing how much she could hurt her beloved wife. She didn’t care that much. She needed to protect Ginny, and she needed to protect her family. The only way she could possibly give Ginny any sort of security was if she took advantage of the fact that she was the only one of Ginny’s children. Hadn’ she already been in danger?



Vincent was going to ask for his wife’s life. She was in the wrong, but he was smart enough to realize that.



One moment he would be convinced that the two of them could be together and the next, he would have to fuck her until she would destroy him. But until then, he needed to keep her protected.



He was already standing at the foot of the stairs, staring at Ginny, and was smirking when he saw her gasp before turning to Ginny.



"You two are going to be very happy, Granger," she grinned.



The two of them walked down the stairs together, Ginny following with her hands wrapped around her husband's shoulders. She had to admit that she was relieved that she didn’t have to see her children in a situation like this again.Mum and Dad were both silent and looking at the bar, Hermione thought that she felt more comfortable that way. Narcissa and Ginny had joined the rest of the family, a quiet conversation took place between her and Narcissa. Mum, Dad, Hermione and Narcissa sat down, while the rest of the family were all still drinking and talking."How do you feel?" Narcissa asked when she saw Hermione turn to face her."I’m alright, I’m fine. Just tired." Hermione smiled."It’ not like we’ll be able to celebrate together." Draco said.

"I think it’ll be better to go to the library." Hermione nodded."I’ll go see Professor Snape." Hermione said as she left the library.Hermione rushed to the library. She walked to the first floor, straight to the front. She walked in the middle of the library, and looked through the stacks. There were books on topics not covered anywhere but on meditation and the importance of reading to increase one's self-esteem. She walked into the Great Hall, and saw Harry and Ron already sitting there. They were watching the books in the Hall and in the Great Hall. Hermione looked out her window and saw at the very tip of the Hogwarts FireRed banner:



"THE DRAGON IS NOT IN THE GIFT OF HE WHO, THE WORLD IS IN! IF YOU STOPED WE'LL HAVE THE WORLD TO WEARING THEM WE'LL HAVE THE WORLD TO WEARING THEM AGAIN! THE DRAGON IS IN THE BOOK OF Spells! "

"Fire is the best weapon!" Hermione shouted at her brother, "You're poisoning me!"

"I know, Hermione. That little talk has already ruined your life. I'll kill you for that."

"No, you won't." Draco deadpanned, "You're completely right, love. I can't even imagine how much it would cost to get the FireRed banner removed. He was smart as a Gryffindor, wasn't he? But the idea of losing all his friends and family was too much to bear. The only thing he could do was hope that he would be able to do better next time.



The next day, Snape was sitting at the breakfast table when Harry, Ron, and Hermione came in.



"What are you doing here, Malfoy?" Harry asked as he looked at his two friends.



"I came in with my parents. I am late to the wedding, couldn't sleep when I saw the Prophet."



"How can you have this? I thought you were happy when you were stuck at Hogwarts." Hermione said, looking at her with vehemence.

"I, too, was stuck at Hogwarts. You and your friends. I even left a note on the window where I was supposed to have been staying. At first I was ecstatic that I was able to just disappear into the castle grounds without being noticed, but then I thought maybe you could help me. I was wrong. I needed your help. I told Fred and George that I wanted to help you. But I also told them that I wouldn't be anywhere else. I needed to make sure you were all right, but I didn't know where to start. You were going to Hogwarts? Failed to ask questions? Aborted a hundred times? I couldn't understand why you would be so insistent on this." The professor sighed, but was silent.

"I have to give a statement."



"No, don't. I'm trying to give you a reason." Severus replied, keeping his lips even at the nape of Harry's.

"Why would you ask me this, you idiot? Why would you even believe that you could trust me? You're just a child. You're not a child either, you don't have to trust me. I am the teacher of the rules and you don't trust me. I don't care."He was silent, eyes still on the floor. He felt bad for asking that question. The very thought made him wince, but he let it go.

"You not going to attack me, are you?"

"Of course not, Draco." She said, sticking her nose into the air.

"You know how to get in the way."

"I know." Draco scoffed, but his face went lopsided.

"I'm not going to hurt you." His eyes went wide and his muscles tightened.

"By the way, I was wondering if you would look at me like that."

"You are not just a cat." Hermione said, coming up against the wall, her hands on both sides.

"You're a man, too. An emotional wreck."Hermione was taken aback.

"Of course not."

"I'm not a cat." She said, not sure if Hermione could even understand.
