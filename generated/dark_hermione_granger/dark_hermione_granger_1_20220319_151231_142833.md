Dear Father and Mother he wrote me. I have a letter from my son, and I hope you will accept it."Hermione smiled at the thought of what he was going to do next.



"I need to write Father and Mother, and they are holding a meeting at Malfoy Manor. Hermione, I have a question for you. There will be a meeting, if you don't want to go yet, I will invite you. If you don't mind, I will make a surprise visit for you." Hermione looked at him, and he nodded.

"You are not going to go alone?"

"Of course not, I don't want to be alone. I don't want to be alone, and I don't want to be alone alone alone." She smiled a sweet smile as she shut the door, pulling her wand out of her bag. She felt the heat of the fire escape in her eyes and let out a high breath, already seeing through the window.The fire escape was cracked open, making an even more disgusting image that she couldn't shut her eyes. The flames were slowly growing bigger and bigger, reaching as high as the ceiling. It was a sight bright enough to make her dream come true, the flames turning into bloody stars and swallowing the lives of the inhabitants.It was filled with hatred, and it was pure and magnificent, completely engulfing her and her entire body. Hermione felt it in her soul, and it brought her out. The flames grew, turning into a giant serpent, and she was able to escape from the flames."It was a long time ago now," Hermione said, raising her hands to show herself.

"You were talking about living with Draco."

"Yes, well, it's not as if he's the only person he talks to. I mean, he's the father of my son. He's my teacher. I'm his friend. He's my brother too." She smiled at that, then looked at her in understanding.

"You're not afraid of him, Hermione. I don't have to tell you that."

"He won't listen," Hermione said, glancing up.

"I'm not afraid of him, but he is aware that you're involved with Draco. So, it's not as if I'm not supposed to question him."

"I can do that, Granger. We have to be careful."Both of them took a step to the left and Hermione saw the look of shock on her brother's face. She kept her eyes closed as they both stood in front of the mirror. She could feel her own heart beating frantically as she saw her reflection in the mirror. Her dark brown eyes were cold, and she looked so soft that Hermione would have to admit that she had never seen anything so beautiful in her entire life. She would have to admit that she was more than willing to look into the eyes of someone who killed her in middle school.When her reflection crashed upon her face, Hermione furrowed her eyebrows in confusion. She had no idea what they were talking about, but she could almost see the look in her eyes as he spoke."I think we're going to need to have a discussion about how to do that. I'm sure we'll have some people from both the Dark and my own families who will be willing to help us."Hermione turned to face him, the expression of fury in his eyes like a madman's.

"Just just for a moment. I want to see what you're talking about."Her eyes met his.

"You wanted to talk about the difference between the wizarding and muggle world. Is that clear?"

"No, I wanted to make sure you understood that magic is different. I'm afraid I have no other way. It's just us, it's our minds. We take one step at a time and push the magic to the furthest recesses of our minds. I think it's impossible for you to get a hold of a mirror, or even a ball of light in the house, but I won't let it get in the way of you. I will need your magic. I will need your memory. I will need your mind. If only you could see. I don't have time to think about everything in the same room. I have to see the future, right now before I forget everything about the past. I need you right now. I will need your mental picture, your thoughts, your memories. It won't take much to defeat me and win. I can't defeat you with just one person."Hermione's mouth shut at that.

"And I can only defeat you with a few people. How do you know that?"

"I believe that you've seen all of your Fathers memories. You've seen that the 'Boy-Who-Lived' is a Muggleborn? And you feel guilty for what he did to the 'Boy-Who-Lived'. I want you to help me. I have an offer to grant your request. You can come to me."Hermione looked at him, her eyes going dark.

"I need your help."

"I know. Please, Draco. I'll do whatever I have to do." Hermione stepped closer, but Draco firmly held her wrists and ankles in his arm.

"I can't risk you getting hurt." He rubbed his skin, "I must have heard your magic for you." Hermione's eyes widened as her heart opened again with fear.

"I know, Hermione. I know. I can't let her hurt you."

"No," Draco admitted.

"She's not a threat."Draco reached around her and pressed her forehead against his. His fingers curled around her shoulder, "Don't touch her."

"What?" Hermione's eyes slowly closed as she shook her head, "I'm not a threat. I'm not."

"You're not," Draco growled.

"You're not a threat, aren't you? If I known you were in the same boat, I would have rushed to his aid and saved you."

"We don't discuss the details, Draco," Hermione said softly.

"You should rest."

"I will allow you," he promised, guiding her back to the table.

"You'll rest for a few days and then return to your friends. If you are determined to remain safe, I will escort you to the castle."

"I can't," she protested.

"I can't even stay here."

"You're not staying here," Draco promised.

"You'll return to your friends."

"I'll be, once you are back," she said. He held up his arm to her and she sighed.

"I can't stay here forever."She watched him letting the tears fall from her eyes before he spoke again.

"You will be fine." She nodded, trying to imagine what the future would hold for her.

"I will always be your mother, Hermione. I will be safe and whole."

"You can't protect me anymore." He whispered.

"You don't know that, Granger. You are the reason I'm alive. I can't let you go."She nodded, letting herself fall asleep. The day before Christmas, she had no idea what she would say if she were asked. She was sorry that she couldn't stay with Draco, but the thought that she would go away on a miscarriage again and again was unbecoming. She didn't want to think about it, but she had to think about the wizard. They were certain that he was her new friend. He would help her if she asked. She didn't want to think about that. It wasn't as if she had any reason to put her life or her family in danger. She wanted to think about what she had to do to end Antonin's life. There was no other explanation. She needed to think.



The walk to the castle was indeed fruitless. When the sun started to light up the castle, Hermione gave up on going to any of the classrooms. She'd spent most of the day in the Forest of Dean. Only two days had passed since she was attacked in the woods. There had been no news. She had no idea what to do. The moment it had been raining, she turned to see the gold that lay on the end of the knife. The blade glowed in the dim room, the moon blue. Her eyes widened when she saw the blood on it. It was so thick it was almost blood, but it was so thick that it was barely noticeable. She looked at the blade, she could see blood on her hands, but she didn’t care. She was done. She was done with this life, and she couldn’t keep it any longer. She turned to the fire, she could see the warmth and the smell of burning hair. A pair of hands reached up to grab her arm, holding her close. She knew that it was the right thing to do, but she couldn't bear to look into her own eyes. She leaned down to kiss Draco's cheek. He gave her a small smile that only showed his complete lack of emotions. She remembered him when they were younger and he was so... attractive."I would like to propose to you."

"What? Yes please."The first thing she noticed about the gesture was how cold it was. She hated how much she could talk herself out of making a choice that would never be fully made. What if she was doomed to never make it to the one she was doomed to love? She knew that not all marriages were created equal. There were limits. No matter what her husband said or did, he always could not stand her. The smell of sex always made her want to run. Never had she thought that it was possible to end up in Malfoy Manor. Though she was no longer in love with the older man, she could feel her first crush on the man when she was sad and in love with him. Hermione felt jealous. He had always been so good to her. She wanted to run away and never thought that she would see the satisfaction. But, she also knew that in the end, it would be the same with him. They were meant to be equals. As much as the Dark Lord might want to change their relationship, that would only complicate matters further."I thought that you were the only one who knew. He would have found out within a year, but it only made the difference in the end."Draco nodded.

"No, I don't think I am one of those people. I'm not in the habit of celebrating and celebrating alone. What is wrong with being alone if you let someone else do all the work?"

"The person who is the problem is you." She pointed directly at him.

"The fuck is that?"

"Who the fuck is the problem?" Draco shrugged his shoulders.

"Who is the problem?"

"I- I don't know who is the problem." She hesitated for a second before speaking.

"Who are the fuck are you?"Draco sat back in his chair and swallowed the lump in his throat.

"You have no idea how much I love you. We have been together for over thirty years and I love you as much as you love me. You are an amazing father, a wonderful husband, and a wonderful friend. I trust that you will do your best to repay us for our support and friendship."



"I know but I need to do it, Hermione," Marcus whispered, his voice cold and cold and so cold that it was difficult to breathe.

"You will never be able to repay us for our support and friendship. You are the reason why I am always the best husband and wife I have, and more importantly, the reason why I am the best person for my daughter."



Hermione smiled, not expecting such a statement, but she felt her heart flutter.

"The wedding. How the hell did you know, I thought you were dating Tom. But now that I think about it, Tom is my best friend. I know you are his best mate too, so that is why I said that I have no feelings for you.

"She smiled again, not sure if she meant it in the present tense.

"He is my best friend, of course. But you are the best friend, he is my only follower and best friend's best friend. If you want to be my best friend, you need to accept me as your soulmate, a bond that will be yours forever!" She smiled again, knowing that she didn't have to choose anything anymore, but she needed to be prepared for the moment she could not control herself.



All day long, Hermione had to be the perfect little Gryffindor. She was smart, independent and ambitious, and she was ready to take on her husband.



The Gryffindor Common Room was the perfect place to hide from her husband. The walls were well-ventilated, the furniture warm and inviting and the carpet soft and warm, and the only thing she couldn't get used to was his presence.



She was the only person in the room that knew who he was talking about. All she could think about was the way their lips felt on one another's and the way their bodies moved around in the room.



The Sly were never this happy and sad about everything, not even the Hufflepuff's ever got this much happiness. All that was the Gryffindors? The two first years? She was not sure herself. In the end, they actually did deserve happiness. This was a wonderful thing, they deserve to live their lives like any other human being. What was the smallest thing that could ruin that? The attacks of the naïveté and hatred? She had to know. The Gryffindorks? They were far more innocent than the Slytherins. They were real people. Not some ghoul. She wasn't sure what they had in mind.In the end, the Slytherins got hurt. All that was left for them to do was grow stronger and keep their strength up. That would be their last year for Hogwarts.



It was done. They were done.



As night fell and the halls grew colder and the Slytherins went out again, Hermione went up to the Great Hall. She had her cloak, a cauldron, and a few other supplies. She went in, dressed, and made her way into the kitchens. She had no idea how to even feel for herself in the freezing air, but she decided to ask Dominika if she could do a simple warming spell. She didn’t like the feel of the cool liquid against her skin. She wondered what kind of spell she’d be using and how long it’d take before she’d get it right.



A brilliant idea caught her eye. She looked down at the incomplete piece of clothing and realized that it was not just a piece of clothing. It was a piece of the fabric woven through her hair, as if it were a woven thread.



Maybe, she thought, there could be a potion that could make her skin glow.



The idea took a few tries to come to fruition. Hermione’s skin began to glow, and it took two calls from her wand to get it to do its work. As if she could talk into her face that could talk.



"Hermione!" She cried.

"I be okay! I’ll be alright!" The three of them vanished off the floor. Hermione looked around, her eyes not leaving her husband for a second to see who was talking to them but rather her face. He had only just gotten out of bed and was still asleep."I’ll be fine," He said.

"I’ll be fine."Hermione felt so sorry for him. She really was sorry for him. He’d never been guilty of anything and she was sure he’d never be able to. Draco was the perfect example of what a father should do, he deserved everything he got.
