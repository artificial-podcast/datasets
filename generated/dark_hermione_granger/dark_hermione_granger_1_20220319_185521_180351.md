Moreover, she criticized the way they’d treated her. It was as if they didn’t care for her if she was a good person."You know, I’ve always assumed that they’d simply treated you differently based on your sexual orientation, Hermione."

"Oh, they did. I hope they’re not trying to hurt you, Granger," Draco said in a tone that made his skin crawl.

"Oh, no, they definitely are!" she said, eyes widening with disgust.

"I’m sure I’d say it’s because you’re so different," he added trying to not sound like a proper man."I’m sure," she said.

"The only thing I know I’m different from... "She turned to him, eyes wide in fear.

"You’re the youngest one of the twins. I think I’ll explain everything." He placed a hand on her shoulder.

"I’ll never be the same to you, Hermione. I’ll never be as different as you. I don’t care. I’ll never hurt you or even be a different person than you."She felt a tear roll down her cheek.

"I’m sure, I’m sure," she said.

"My father knew."

"Because he’s a professor here, not a professor at Hogwarts," Ron said.

"He might’ve even taken the class in his own home."

"That’s not true!" Hermione said.

"He didn’t. He went to Hogwarts with his father. He’s Hogwarts’ professor now. A friend of his now’s father. He’ll never learn how to fly again!"

"He did, you know," Ron said.

"He was an amazing teacher, and more so because he’ a muggle-born. I don’t know why he didn’t do as well as he did."Ron shrugged.

"I don’t think I’ll ever understand him, but this is the best I can do." He added a smirk.

"You want to see how He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is doing?"Hermione shook her head.

"No. He wasn’t a bad teacher, I just didn’t know he was a wizard."

"I’m okay with you hating Severus," Ron said quietly. He turned around to leave.

"You can go back upstairs."Hermione looked at him for a moment, but he shut the door.

"Good, we’re downstairs." She turned back around and entered the room.The room below was dark and cold, like a slow drain from the hallway. We froze, afraid that she was going to suffocate us or something. The sound of a door swinging open could be heard in the distance. She looked down at her hand. The ring on it was open and was covered in a purple tasme that was as thin as a thin fingernail. Her eyes met his, and he lifted his head to stare at her.

"I think I’ve finally told you something. I think I know why he’s been acting so strangely."

"He’s acting strange?" Draco asked.

"What do you mean? Why? What’s he been doing over the years?"

"I don’t know," Hermione admitted.

"He’s been using some of his older victims."

"He’s been using some of my victims?" Draco asked.

"What? Why?"

"He’s been abusing his power all these years," Hermione explained.

"He’s been abusing it for years. It wasn’t until he came home that he’d stopped."

"Half the moon?" Pansy asked.

"It was, but now I’m surprised I’m not even able to talk to him! It’s so strange seeing his face so clear." Hermione pouted.

"It’s like he just doesn’t understand it."

"I’ll tell you later then," Draco said.

"Well, I’ll see you then, dear. It’s time for breakfast." Hermione smiled, sitting down on the high table.

They sat in silence for a while, looking at one another. At last, Hermione heard crackling from the next room.... ... ... ... ..Pansy stood up, wearing a pair of jeweled glasses. Hermione saw a flash of light behind her as she looked up. Pansy walked towards Hermione and placed her hand on top of Hermione's, making her gasp. Hermione heard her gasp and put her arm around Pansy's neck, hugging her tightly. Pansy let go of her arm and looked at Hermione.... ... ... ... ..Hermione saw that Pansy was holding onto her and was whispering. The other girl looked away and looked into her eyes. Pansy looked at her like a hawk. Hermione felt tears of love, but didn't care. She was all for her friend. In the end, she found herself loving her husband even more than she knew she should."Hermione, what have you seen so far?"

"Nothing. Just a bunch of idiots trying to get somewhere."At least he didn't say it out loud. She was afraid of the truth. She still was. She knew that it wasn't a coincidence that Antonin had just been speaking about Augustus. She'd not heard anything since. It wasn't as if she could trust the man."I saw a bunch of kids running away from the Quidditch World Cup. We were inside and it was snowing. Everyone was terrified. Then I heard them running out the front gate. I knew exactly who they were but I couldn't see who was a spy.

"Troll!" Lavender shrieked.

"You don't need to do this, you won't get hurt!" Daphne snarled.

"You know what?" Theo said looking at the two girls.

"What do you mean by that?"

"You both know what I am, but we don't know what the other is up to." Daphne said smiling.

"I think it’s safe to say that this is a trap," Hermione said looking at the three boys who were laughing at them.

"I think you need to go back to your dorms I’m sure you know that", he said with a small smile.

"I’ll be there as soon as you’re home."

Harry and Hermione were walking back to the Great Hall, silent.

"Just for a moment, I’ll be inside the Great Hall, I’ll be in the Room of Requirement, and you’ll be safe."

They walked out, Hermione following them, and she took the floo as soon as she could.

They were in the Room of Requirement, and they saw a blue mist floating over the top of a large stone pillar.

The stool they were standing in was covered with blood and dust, so dark was it peeling off the stone. The young wizard, who was now a second year, was staring at the stone, his face white in fear. All those feet in his wake were now covered in blood and dust. (the second year was un-blooded, and his robes were stained with blood from the last war, and the third year was not blooded)

"What in the world are you doing here, old man?" The Dark Lord asked the tall boy, and the boy's stomach lurched at the look.

"I'm standing in front of the statue of Salazar Slytherin, and I have a visitor. Hello?"_August,The sun is low in the sky, and the wards around it are all blown up. The room is bathed in a light blue light, like a very dark and stormy night. The beautiful colors of the roses on the table are puffy and wet as they warm up the room. I stare around the room, looking for something that will help me in the coming days. The room is filled with small, warm living quarters, one of which is on the left side of the bed. There are empty parchments to help me with the pain in my body. The cottage has a garden, but I can't really use it. The room is empty and unused, but the kitchen is unused. It is exactly the kind of room I have in Hogwarts." Draco muttered to himself.

"I don't have any friends, and that is the only thing I enjoy. There is a room for all your other stuff, like my magic, potions, and books. I also don't have a room for the house-elves."Hermione was shocked by this. She had been in her room for a week now, and had spent most of it in a room that looked like a bathroom.

"Are you alright?" Draco asked. He was standing over her, looking at her with a cold look.

"What are you doing here?"

"I have a room, Hermione, and I had to make breakfast while you were gone." Hermione said, feeling her face going red.

" course not, Cissy. You were just giving me a warm, nurturing hand." She went to the window and looked at her.

"You're just the paintball, but I thought you looked a lot better than I did. And you looked like the devil, too."Hermione didn't want to believe that, but she knew that it had to be the truth.

"You are not my daughter, and I am not your mother. Please, tell me this, and tell me you love me. I love you, too." She said softly, her eyes falling.

"I don't have to tell you everything, but I can say that I love you. I love you and I want to spend the rest of our lives together." Hermione scoffed and turned around, the Slytherin running her eyes over to the head table, Hermione's Slytherin looks were getting darker and darker. She felt a burning desire go through her and she felt powerful, ready to take on the Gryffindor Prince. Her mind was racing, preparing to play. She felt the fire burning in her hands and the Gryffindor's eyes widened with panic and trembled. Hermione felt the burning sensation in her hands as well. She felt the need to scream and she felt the need to reach into her bag, ready to grab the Gryffindor's blood and drink it. She did not fall, she did not even know of her powers. She did not even know what to do with herself.

Did he really want to hurt her? She couldn't imagine what his reaction would be.

Did he truly think he could do anything to her? She couldn't even begin to imagine what he would do to her if she was just a simple citizen.

This was all Draco. He had a daughter, and a baby. A child Draco was going to have. And a child he never could get pregnant.

What if she killed him? She didn't want to even think about that, not when Draco could be the one who truly loved her.

Soon enough, she would kill him.

Draco was going to have a child. A child that he never even mentioned until he was a child. A child that he never would have mentioned to a potential future lover.He felt a light touch to his temple. He wasn't sure how he was able to do this in such a short period of time. The power, the power to be more than his father.

"What do you want with your child?" Draco asked, his eyes going dark as if he had been woken up from a sound sleep. The moment the words left his mouth, he collapsed on the desk and ran his hands through his hair and nothing happened. He couldn't stop the stare. He didn't understand what the game was about. Why did he have to do this? Was he supposed to be in the middle of the battlefield trying to kill me?"

"No...  You didn't. What do you mean by 'in the middle of the battlefield'?"

"He was supposed to be in the middle of the battlefield with my army, but I was able to slip in behind his back and capture him without arousing suspicion."

"He was supposed to be in the middle of the battlefield with your army." Hermione replied.

"And he was supposed to be killed in front of my people?" Ron asked.

"Yes. You had enough of your own men. My men and I were the only ones left. You had to go to the south, to the west, and look for Greg in the old country. After spotting him I know that he is somehow in the lockers. I walk past the house and make my way to the bathroom. It is almost time for breakfast, but I am not hungry. I crawl out of bed and hit the library. Maybe I am not ready for this and the book room is full of explanations about magic and the Dark Arts, but I didn’t want to waste time reading. I walk into the library and search for Eira, but she is already gone. The shelves are empty, and I wonder who is going to be in the Black Library. I look for a book about elemental magic and find it. Oh no, this is not magic, this is magic. I look up and see the youngest Weasley, my cousin Harry Potter, who is now my cousin. Harry is looking up and smiling. I gaze back and see a dark, amazing smile on his face. Then I see Draco and Narcissa. Both are wearing red and black robes, the hell rose to them. Narcissa is holding a silver harp and Draco is wearing a black cloak. Harry is leaning on his mother's shoulder. I recognise the red and black robes. I recognise the Slytherin in me, I recognise the Gryffindor in Harry. I recognise the Slytherin portraits in the Hall. All three of them are red and black. The way they look is slightly different, but they look like the Slytherins, as if they are the twins, and they were actually the same in the library."

"That’s not true," Ron said."It was the twins who told me."

"True." Hermione said, looking back at the table of books.

"But I thought they were just books. They are part of my legacy."Ron gave her a loving smile.

"Thank you, Hermione. I only wish you the best for the future."She smiled into the glass, then took a sip of the Firewhiskey.

"I’ll take the drink."

After her long visit to Draco Malfoy, Hermione turned her attention to the tea room. was a giant wall with a giant flaming wall on one side and a massive carved statue of a snake on the other. It had two doors that lead to multiple rooms with different tea towels in different pots and cauldrons. The exact number of rooms was hidden in the room-door code.When Hermione entered the room he was in, she saw a large chair next to a table. She sat down in the chair and walked over to it. The tea cup was in the middle of it. She took the closed book and unfolded it.

"

"What kind of tea would you like?" Draco asked, looking at her with a look that sounded like a puppy's pout."You haven’t read anything yet, Pansy said as she took a swig of the drink.

"You won’t even know what it is until you try."

"I am sorry," Hermione said apologetically.

"I was just trying to drink something. I didn’t want to wake the poor boy up from his nap."

Pansy was the sort of woman who could make one very uncomfortable for the sensitive-looking woman in her position. Hermione saw no reason to share this information with her. Pansy was already quite intoxicated when she stepped out of the back door of the castle. If she had her way, she wouldn’t have a chance to answer any of his questions."I’m sure he’ll be happy to hear that."

"... Happy?" Hermione asked, her eyes going wide."Yes, he’s happy. I’m sure he’ll find it easy to miss his mother’s birthday."

"Hah...  Thank you, Hermione. It’s nice to spend time with you."Hermione’s eyes fell to her hands. An unexpected smile appeared on her face."Your father is a hospital, I’m sure." A nurse said.

"I see."Hermione nodded.
