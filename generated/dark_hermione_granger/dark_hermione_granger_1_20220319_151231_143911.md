Merlin, you're stupider than we thought if you think so." Narcissa snickered.

"You just had a letter?" Lucius finally grimaced as he sat down.

"It was from the Dark Lord," he admitted.

"He sent me a letter and I had to bite my tongue to not ruin it." His eyes met hers as he said, "When did you ever get this?"

"I’ve been on your side since I was born," Lucius said, his voice icy.

"I wanted to tell you everything I know and how I’ve fought to protect you."Narcissa’s eyes went to the letters in the desk.

"I worried about you, my dear."

"I’m not worried at all. I’m sure that you’ve all been reading this book somewhere!"

"I’m sure that you have already!" Narcissa said, taking a deep breath and trying not to let the tears consume her face.

"I’ve been reading this book with you for over a year now and I can’t imagine how much it changes you."Narcissa laughed.

"You used to be that good a girl!"

"Too bad I didn’t." She said, burying her face in the crook of her neck tried to sit up. The door had a squeaky creak as the stew turned to stone."I know what you’re talking about," Draco said in a whisper, his eyes sparkling with mischief.

"You’re talking about, you know, the two of us."He turned to look at her but she didn’t look at him. His eyes were blank and dark, like a ghost, and it was clear that he didn’t know what to say."What do you want, Malfoy?" Hermione said.

"Do you really care what I’ve been up to all day? I’ve been up until four in the morning, and I’ve been up for hours."

"It’s fine, Weasley, just don’t interrupt me," he said, gesturing to the chair next to him.

"I just want to get you out of here."

"Okay," Hermione said.

"Have you heard anything about the Chamber of Secrets?"

"No, I haven’t."

"Well, I have, but I don’t know what the Chamber does. I have no idea what it does in the Chamber."Theo sighed, and Hermione glanced up at him.

"I’d say you’re the best professor in the entire school, and the best advisor I’ve ever needed."He ignored the fact that her eyes were widening, and instead looked down at his hands for a second.

"I’m not sure if I’ll ever get the chance to defend you or not. But I’ve got no real objections."Sitting up, he took out his wand and put it on his fingers. *White noise.*Hermione felt the cold darkness around her.

"Couldn’t believe it! You’re in the Chamber!"He let out a breath and turned his face to face her.

"Granger, you can’t be that stupid." He spat.

"I’m sorry, I’m so sorry."Severus turned to her but stopped when he saw the reflection in her eyes of his Padma. Her eyes were a stark comparison to what she was. She was a hideous, hideous caricature of herself. She was pale and dim and cold and dark and dark and dark."I’m so sorry?" She asked with fear and tears.

"I’m so sorry...  How can I even... ?"Severus watched her for a few moments before she confessed her secret.

"I told you, I told you. I’m so sorry." sighed and turned away, willing her heart to beat out of her chest. She was lucky that she didn’t have to explain what happened to her like that to Sirius. Even if it was a lie, she was ready to see him in a better light. He deserved to know the truth.



She found herself staring at the clock, trying to keep from running from the moment she stepped out of her room. She didn’t know how long she’d been out before someone else was awake. It had been a long time, almost a year. She’d been so lost in her thoughts that she didn’t notice the way someone moved even when she did.



It was a bit of a stretch to think that Hermione’s "free roam" would have anything to do with her being so careful.After all, she had a number of occasions where she had to actually run into a "aristocratic" bishop because of some bizarre policy she had to break. It didn’t mean she was open to ideas or accepting their terms. All that really explained her seemingly endless periods of confusion about the nature of her political duties."I’ve been asked a few times about your ideas for improving the school." She started, moving her hands around in the air as if to communicate her concerns.

"I thought we had a compromise...  but I’m surprised you didn’t see the change you wanted to see."Barely half an hour later, she discovered that Sirius and Remus were both married. He was already married, and the two of them had been using each other as human shields. Sirius must’ve mentioned it to them at some point, and Remus had been impressed by the idea. That he and Sirius were actually married didn’t bother her.



"You’ve been trying to get to know each other for a while now." Remus teased her, a little too much for her liking.

"I’ve been wanting to see you together for years."



"I have to ask why you’re here if you’d rather visit me in the Hospital Wing."Hermione wanted to contradict Draco, but she knew better.

"You’re not going to ask me where the hell I’re going to begin this." She paused in her explanation.

"I just think you’re the wittiest girl in the entire school."He arched an eyebrow in inquiry.

"I’ve never seen you like this before."

"I’m not asking you to marry me," she told him."Then marry me," he said.

"I think we’ll have a wonderful life. But I don’t want to spend a lifetime with you. I want to save you."Hermione’s face went red."Why did you not marry me?" he asked.

"I have both, I am the only one who can. I don’t want to be alone."

"You should have told me," she said.

"I talked to you."

"Wasn’t that the plan?" he asked.

"And I don’t want to go through the torture of having to explain every single thing to you."

"You’ll have to ask me the same questions over and over again," Hermione said.

"I’m sure you’re going to love me."

"You’re already been married, and I’m sure you’re only just starting to plan your wedding," Draco said with a grin.

"I’m sure you’ve already tried to convince your husband that you’re perfectly all right."Hermione smiled, and let her hand trail across Draco’s shoulders.

"I was, but I’m not sure I want to be there."

"Oh, that’s sooo good of you," Draco murmured his eyes meeting mine and I just looked at him.

"Draco," I said, trying to not blush.

"You’re so beautiful. I don’t know how I’ll ever want to be any other way, but I can’t stop thinking about this. I don’t know what to do, but I’m going to be so lonely. I’ll never leave you."I looked at him and he just smiled and said, "You’re right," I was feeling very awkward about this.

"You’re right, I’ll never leave you," I said, feeling completely innocent "I’m fine, I’m not worried," I smiled.

"You’re a Gryffindor, and you didn’t raise me like that." I cracked an eye and looked at him, he looked like a little boy. I couldn’t help but wonder if he was the one who had this conversation with Draco. I thought back to this conversation with Blaise.

"What’s going on here?" Blaise asked.

"We need to find out." I said.

"I’m not sure what I’m even asking, but I’m the one who brought you here Blaise pointed his wand at the middle of the room. Ashley quietly fell forward and raised her wand as she felt the power radiating from her."Oh, come on, it’s real!" Ashley giggled."Yeah, I’ve been doing that for ages." Draco chuckled."That’s a good sign, Draco." Ashley sighed, ready to share."I’ve used it in the past, but never did I want to actually use it."

"Well, let’s just go back to our dorm and help you." Draco pushed his way to the back with an open hand. Hermione asked.

"Yes?"



"You’ve been practicing for over a week. What do I have to do?" Draco asked.



"I’ve been practicing for over a week." Hermione answered.



"You have a tattoo?"



"Yes?" Hermione asked.



"How many days do you have to get it?"



"I’m not sure yet. I’ll ask."



"It’s a long process." Hermione said apologetically.



"Just the outline," Draco said.

"You’ll be okay."She hesitated.

"I’ll do my best."



Hermione was rushed to the Hospital Wing by Lucius, and also by Rabastan. She was in the Hospital Wing after receiving a letter. The letter had a picture of a boy and a girl, and Hermione was gaping at the boy's face, but she ignored the girl’s words before they went to the letter. She didn’t know what type of letter was meant by a girl’s name, but it had a picture of a boy and a girl, who both seemed a bit too happy for their age. Draco was wearing a letter with a picture of a girl, holding a baby that Hermione had seen in her dreams. He pulled out a green, black, and white striped pajama bottoms, and a pair of matching pink strappy heels. He had a baby in his arms, and Draco was holding it to her, holding a watermelon on one side, and a pink baby in the other. He was wearing black, and the baby looked a lot like the baby in the photos.Draco pulled out a new pair of white heels, and did a quick base-toe and corset over it. This is nice, but not what I want. He did a strappy back, with a pair of pink heels, a baby in the arms, and a pink baby in the same arm."



"Oh, I’m so glad that baby survived," Hermione said as she kissed the baby on the cheek.



"Do you think that you’ll take a trip to Diagon Alley to get this?" Blaise asked.



"Oh, I’ve already taken a trip to Diagon Alley," Hermione said.

"I was so nervous. It’s the only shop in the village that accepts baby milk."



"Well, I actually just couldn’t wait," Draco said, grinning.



"I’m sure you’ll be okay, he said, grinning again."I was," Neville said.

"It was so surreal."Hermione bit her lip, trying to not gape. Draco really was the most perfect person she’d ever met."What else?" she asked.

"We’re supposed to go celebrate a family’s holiday, I suppose."

"It’s my birthday," he said, grinning again.

"And I’ve been thinking about what I’d say to that."Theo’s eyes went wide.

"I’ve been thinking!"Hermione gathered her thoughts and decided to take the time to think about the thoughts she had while hearing his. She did so in three different ways. The first was to go to the bathroom connected to the main room. She took a deep breath and allowed her mind to make logical connections. She grabbed her pillow and pushed it aside, choosing the right side. She placed her head back on her pillow and took a deep breath. The second thought was to go to the mirror. She opened it there and waited for the slight hum of someone’s voice. The other way around, she was already in the mirror. It was a mirror of the past. She could feel the dark, lingering from her past. She entered her mirror and looked around. She saw a piece of glass that was covered with her own reflection in the mirrors. It was a long, narrow, blue-green glass with a silver leaf in the middle. The door was closed and the curtains were drawn around the window. Hermione hid her face in it, watching as the reflection in it stared back at her with a dark, purple-green light. The room was lighted up and Hermione felt the reflection in her mirror shift. She could see the outline of blood on the floor. Bloody Hell, this is what I saw, is what I saw, she mused, and the room was filled with an eerie calmness. The reflection of her face in the glass was dark purple, and the room was filled with darkness and pain. It was so dark, I felt like I was going to die. It hurt like I was going to vomit and I couldn't focus on anything. The pain was intensifying and getting worse. How did I even make it through? Why did the dark purple taste so similar to the fire whiskey? I couldn't even remember what it tasted like before. I was glowing it, sure, but how did I know when it was Dark? Or if I had to... 



The fire was even more burning than I had initially feared, and it was pushing them both towards me. I felt the fire around me, but it was still burning, so I couldn't focus. I realized it was the only way to get out. I cast a protection charm, but there was nothing I could do to stop the spell. My fingers barely moved, a hollow feeling from the Dementor. I tried to get out of here, but my grip was restrained. My wand was not in my hand, so I could not cast anything. I couldn't touch anything, so I willed myself to focus on my wand instead of the Dementor. I pull my wand closer to my heart, so I can see the emptiness in the form of the Dementor. My eyes land on a small table. It is just a table, and I can see a small bed, a blanket and a small table with a wooden table without any lights on.

"I know how to make potions," Pansy laughs.

"I’ve heard the stories of little pinks getting blended up with cream and milk," Daphne laughs.

"Dumbledore uses potions," Luna adds.

"I don’t know how, but it’s something that I like."

"You think I’ve never tried, Luna?" Draco asks.

"Maybe," Daphne laughs.

"I don’t know," she shrugs.

"I’m not sure," Luna sighs, almost whispering.

"I’m sure there are books in the Restricted Section in the library." Pansy is looking at the man who got himself killed trying to find the book."I’m not sure what the Restricted Section is, as far as I know it’s not the only place people are able to find books." Draco looks up, his eyes wide.

"I suppose the Restricted Section is for books that are banned in the school."

"Not everyone can get into Hogwarts," Draco shrugs.

"It’s not like most people are good enough to get into the Restricted Section."

"You have to get the books," Blaise complains.

" don’t even know what to do with them."

"I’m sorry, but we’re not going to do this," Daphne quipped.

"We’re not even sure that this is a good idea."

"We’re not entirely sure that it’s a good idea," Pansy snorted.

"How can you say that when we’re already so drunk and so used to the potions."This conversation turned into a conversation that Hermione was positive would never end.
