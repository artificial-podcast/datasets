The first week of the new school year was filled with excitement and excitement, but excitement was fleeting at the present moment. While it was the first full week after the end of the war, Hydrus and his friends had only just begun to get the hang of the holidays. Hermione had given him a small piece of the peace they'd been dreaming of since the day he was finally free of the Imperius Curse, but he didn't dare ask. Something had changed in his new home, and he wasn't sure he had the energy or the motivation to push things further than what was already there.The entire school year had just been starting to close, and Hermione was ready for the school year to end. She found herself nodding off in the corridor trying to not think about all the things that happened during the year. Hadn't he been out there, taking all the foul smelling potions, and injuring everyone else?It wasn't at all what she expected either, due to her family being one of the few major families without a single member of the Resistance. It was hard to see what kind of people were so easily corrupted. So, she decided to try to think about the last few years she was in school with Antonin. There would be plenty of time and opportunity for mistakes. What she really wanted to consider was what she learned about the Dolohovs, and what it would do to Oliver.She tucked her head down in the corner of the library and counted her three friends. Karkaroff, who was now in Slytherin House, had been talking about how he had gotten his name and the location of the room he was in the morning; Slughorn, who had been helping Mrs. Norris get her clothes back from the boys; and then, Pucey, who had been helping Harry, Hermione, and Ron with their homework. The book she had been reading had been over a hundred pages long; and the little snake had picked up on the big rabbit hole they had been forced to dive into in order to enter the rabbit hole. Hermione had been amazed that the Potter's had never been able to find such a big rabbit hole before. Harry had been amazed too, because he had never believed in the idea of a Horcrux being destroyed. Hold on a moment... The intestines of an animal are supposed to be indestructible, so how could they be destroyed by the Cruciatus Curse? 

It had been Harry's idea to make an antidote for the Cruciatus Curse. He had been told that it was illegal to make so much poison in the wizarding world. But Harry had been fired by the Order for poisoning the high-prize. The poisoning had left a sickening scar on his neck.

The potion was only offered to those who had passed their Potions class, and the antidote was supposedly a blood substitute, but the apparition had left a scar on his face, and was now healing his scar."Such a pity," Draco said, pulling his wand from his pocket and whispering, "I think they’ll figure it out."

"This place is dreadful," Blaise said with a sigh.Hermione looked over at the group, her eyes focusing on Draco, who looked at her with a look of disappointment."Then let’s go," Theo said, looking at her with a smirk.

"I’m sure I’ll be okay." She said after a while, glaring at Draco and Draco’s hand covering their shoulders."How?" Hermione asked. watch how you do it," Draco quipped."How do you even know?" Hermione asked."I don’t know," he said, looking at her with a smirk."Don’t you dare insult her," she said with a smirk."I am," he said with a wave of his hands.

"I am a Malfoy. I am not any less of a person than you. I just...  not... "

"It’s not really that bad," Hermione said.

"Just a little...  you are one."She turned to him and said, "Oh, I see. I still trust you."

"I’m not sure what your relationship is with older people is a relationship?" He asked."No, I’m not sure. I don’t know if I could or not...  I think we are even... " His eyes were a shade more... golden.

"What do you mean... " She turned to him.

"You’re probably in love with me."

"I don’t think I’ll ever understand that," he said.

"I think you’re the most beautiful woman I have ever met and you’re the one who is always there for me." Hermione smiled,"You’re right, I’m right." Severus nodded as he lifted his wand, inviting the three students to join him. The last students left with matching smiles as their professor left them to return to their dormitories. Pansy was like a ghost, never leaving the Great Hall, and Pansy was like a daughter to the ghost of Fleur. The only thing she didn’t seem to like is the invisibility cloak. Hermione and Draco had a similar cloak in the common room, that was the only thing she was different than anyone else. It was then that they saw the birth of the couple’s daughter and the way she looked as well.

"Well, well, well," Hermione said, her voice sounding more like a whisper than a word.

"What’s happened to her?"

"She’s been away for a few days. She’s barely slept, but she’s just been asleep."

Hermione smiled.

"She’s been gone for a few days now. I’ve had to get her back from her parents."

Draco nodded, eyes still closed.

"I can’t believe you’ve decided to do such a thing," she said at me, and I nodded.

"You’re right, I’m not sure I’m the best person to ask."

It was then that I heard the "Eradicating" magic coming from a faraway corner of the room. It wasn’t as loud as the explosion from the others, and it wasn’t as strong as the spells from the Order.

It was Dumbledore’s voice that woke me, and I turned my head to look it up. The words were soft and clear, like I was watching them speak, and I felt the presence of them.

"All of you, listen closely. You are all witnesses of something very, very unlikely to happen. I know that you are all playing this as if it were absolutely true. I know that you are all playing this not as a game, but as a reminder that the Dark Lord is about to take control." Dumbledore’s eyes were shining with an intensity that could make a person’s entire body shake. He was ready to go, ready to go, ready to kill. He was ready to kill Albus, ready to kill Dumbledore. He was ready to kill them all."There’s no need to be so many lies. All we need are a couple of facts." Dumbledore’s face fell.

"They won’t trust you anymore. sorry!" Hermione cried.

"If only I could help them. My parents are not very good people, they would not even be able to hear me."

"They will not listen to you." Dumbledore sighed.

"They are my family, and I’ve spent the last few days trying to convince them. They are the only ones on the Wizengamot. My first priority is the safety of the students. Do you understand?"

"Yes, I do. I understand." Hermione nodded.She turned her head to look at the Gryffindor girls, who were standing back. Blaise and Pansy were laughing at the sight and were looking up, and Daphne and Luna were staring at the two Slytherins, making eyes glow with disgust and fear.

"So they’re here!" Hermione called out, her hand reaching for Blaise, and with Luna’s flick of her wrist, the pair were levitating her around the table with a silver frame.

"I hope they are not here!" Luna shouted, her voice so low that even the ceiling trembled with the sound. The two girls watched as they moved their hands and feet, making the table vibrate and move.

"Oh, Hermione," Blaise whispered, his hand coming up to take Luna’ chin in his.

"Luna," he whispered, turning his head to look at her, his eyes trying to capture her.

"You need to wear that." He trailed off as he felt her lips on his and his hands on his shoulders.

"I’m starting a chalkboard." He tapped his fingers on the chalkboard and started to sketch out the letter P on the board.

"You will need colored pencils or paper." He grinned, his fingers were perfect as he left her and took Luna’s hands in his too and began sketching.

"The Sorting Hat." She smiled happily as he finished his letter and replaced it with a small pack of parchment.

"Thank you for all of your help, but I can’t help you with this one, I can’t wait to see your handwriting."

"I’m sorry I couldn’t help you, it was the best decision I have ever made in my entire life, but I wanted to go into this process in a different fashion... " Harry started, struggling to keep his voice steady after all this time."I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to, but I want to thank you for everything you do for me, and for all my secrets I am so sorry. It was a small sacrifice, but I truly believe he's the best." He said grinning.

"I’m so so so so so so so so so. I don’t ever want to hurt him." Harry whispered regretfully.

"I’m sure he would be so kind to take such a small sacrifice. My parents have always been so kind to me, Harry." Draco said with a smile.

"You’re thinking of Remus," Harry said grinning, he didn’t have to see the look on his father’s face when they faced each other in the Hall.

"I just wanted to ask." Remus said smiling.

"We’re both still in school and we both love the people. We just need a little time to recover." Hermione added with a smile.

"What are you trying to say?" Sirius asked smirking.

"We’re both still in school and we both love the people." Remus answered.

"We have to go to the Chamber of Secrets in an hour." Sirius said grinning.

"We have to save the world." Lucius said grinning as he looked at the two.

"We’ll go and save the world?!" Harry cried.

"We’ll go and save the world!" Remus cried, smirking.

"I think it time you two join the fray!" Remus shouted, everyone except for Draco and Harry and Hermione.

"We’re leaving!" Sirius yelled, his bright green eyes glowing with determination.

"You look so beautiful!" Remus shouted back, his voice was soft and sweet.

"We’ll go and save everyone!" Sirius cried again, his eyes going wide and his face turning into a ghost.

"We’ll never forget the one time that you two made me cry!" Sirius cried again, happy tears rolling down his cheeks.

"I’m so so so... " Harry whispered, his eyes turning into sapphire.

"What is it?" Draco asked quietly.

"It’s a Marauder’s Map." Harry nodded in agreement.

"Could you send me one?" Draco asked.

"Of course, please." Harry admitted, his eyes landing on Neville.

"I’m glad you’re not taking advantage of me." He smirked as he put on a finger.

"It’s for the best that I’ve only had you here for a few days, I’m sure you’ll be able to handle it." He said matter-of-factly.

"We’re going to do it."

Loki gripped his wand tighter, ready to defend when the door squeaked and opened.

What? Should I stop him?

"I’m going to defend our home," Hermione said, her voice sharp with fear.

"We’ll be at the Malfoy Manor every night from sunrise until sundown."

"My home," Loki said with a sigh.

"My home is in Hogsmeade."

The twins thought for a moment before Loki nodded in understanding.

"We’re going to sit in the library with our friends, in bed, while we prepare for dinner."
 Hermione asked a bit confused."I need to get away from this room."

"What?" he asked almost shocked."I didn’t know you were like that. I am not like you." Hermione caressed his cheek."I like you, I like you so much." he kissed her forehead.Hermione felt something in her chest. She was embarrassed."You just keep asking my questions." she said softly."Draco, what are you doing here?" he asked."I’m not staying here. I’m here on a date with you. the Slytherin said with a smirk.Hermione snorted and giggled. She was a Gryffindor! She had never really enjoyed being a Gryffindor. They had to be a couple."You can meet me in the kitchens!" The Slytherin said so loudly that he lost his temper."Neither am I." Hermione giggled.

"We just have to go to the kitchens!"

"We’ll go to the kitchens, then?" The Slytherin suggested.

"Why are you so stubborn? You think you can be a good person and not just a Mudblood?"The door opened as a student stood there and looked around.

"An old man," he said.

"I don’t know if they know the name of the man, but he was in the last war. He was one of the first to go. I don’t know how long I was there, but he is now married to a woman."The entrance of a wild beast in the middle of the entrance hall was reflected in Mrs. Norris’ eyes.

"He is much the same as me." She sniffled.

"I was going to ask if you were here to teach me," a Gryffindor said, eyeing the young man.

"A Gry is not just a boy, but a man as well."

"Yes," Draco nodded.

"What are you doing here?"

"Nesting a couple of rooms for the Hufflepuffs, some of whom are in Slytherin territory. We were told that you were one of them," Theo explained.

"I was," Draco smiled.

"I’m sorry?"

"No," Draco said.

"I’ve been living here for a year."

"Well, you have to be an eleven year old boy to join us," Theo said.

"The whole school will be there for that," he added.

"I’ll be watching the whole thing."Hermione felt a pang of pity for him. How could he have done this? He was the kind of teacher she’d had to teach, and she’d never had to see a ghost. He was gone now, but she didn’t know what to do with him."I’m sorry," Draco said.

"I’m not sure. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to."Hermione nodded.

"I’ll make sure you’re all prepared."

"I’ll be happy to."Theo nodded.

"In the meantime, you’ll have to go to the kitchen and get a knife, and a fork."He pointed his wand at the floor and began to make the cut slowly. The wooden door was rusted with a variety of dirt. It swung open, gleaming against the white flowers.

"Don’t worry. You’ll be fine."A knife rammed into the wood and sliced through the woodchips.

"You’ll be fine."A thin stinging hex sliced through the wood.

"You’re free to slice until you bored," Pansy laughed.

"Don’t you dare think about leaving me like that."

"I’ll see if I can make this even worse." Harry snorted.

"That won’t do at all." He sneered.

"I’m not sure I’d like a more serious way to spend my evening." Hermione snorted.

"Maybe I should join you in the library and watch you eat?" Daphne said in amusement.

"Maybe I’ll go and see what all the fuss is about." Harry nodded.

"I’ll stay long enough.
