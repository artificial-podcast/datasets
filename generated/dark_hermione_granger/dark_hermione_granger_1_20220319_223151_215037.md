"- A haunted house that can only be found in the Black family home. It was founded in 1222 and the Black family had some of the highest house values in the land. Children have to attend classes at least once a week, while their parents spend the majority of their days at Hogwarts Castle. The house is haunted as a child, it is said to hold the memory of a child from a cursed generation. The only place it can be found is in the dungeons, there is a set of windows that resembles a ghost house, but the actual story behind it is unknown.

"Children, you must not enter this house from this room. You will be locked inside and will not even know who is who until you reach the end of April, and it's too dangerous to let someone else know."Draco snorted as he thought about that.

"I don't think so. I don't think I need to worry about that."

Hermione barely had enough time to think before the clock struck noon and the four of them apparated to Malfoy Manor. She spent most of it in the Forbidden Forest, watching the trees grow and how they looked. The tree, however, had already been completely cleared and completely shrubbery was planted between the thick branches, allowing people to walk in easily. Hermione saw a glowing light float in front of her, and was amazed that it looked that way.A moment later, she heard a loud 'pop' and she ran towards it. She didn’t think it was the first time, but it was also her favourite part of Hogwarts.She walked towards it, almost feeling the weight of her shoes fall on her shoulders. The atmosphere was suffused with light, a warm light. Hermione narrowed her eyes at the sound and felt her heart beating against her chest."How do you know?" she asked breathlessly."I’m not sure yet."

"I think you know."

"I do."

"Did I mention it already?"

"No."

"No."

"No."

"No."A sob ripped at his chest, mixing with the pounding of his chest.He was lost for words, the tears now soaking through his hair and clothes. His eyes filled with tears only because he was sure of that. His arms shaking. His chest swelling at the thought of his death, it was wrong to use words that weren’t his own."I’m sorry," he whispered, splitting his tears and running his fingers through his hair.

"I’m sorry for not killing you. I’m sorry for everything that happened... "He was silent for a while, but then he began sobbing."I’m sorry for everything."An ancient bond that no one else could have prepared for, the Dark Lord’s power was stronger than any potion would have been able to contain. Even with the right spell, an explosion could be easily repelled."I’m sorry for everything." He begged, his wand pointed at something in the crowd of people.

"I’m sorry for the pain that you’ve caused me. I’m sorry for your loss. I’ve only just got to be a father. I’m sorry for everything that’s happened in my absence. I’m sorry for everything that has happened to me."

"I’m sorry for everything." His voice carried through the room.Hermione felt tears well up in her eyes when she heard the words that came out of her mouth."I was just joking," she said.She felt the tears that were already forming in her eyes fall down. She felt like she was crying and was also a person who was trying to be presentable. This was not the time for jokes or jokes. She just wanted to be presentable and keep running away with her life. She felt like she was trapped in a cage, questioning everything. There was nothing that she could do to help her."I’m sorry for everything that came out of nowhere." He said.

"I’ll talk to you in a few days grimaced, but did not stop following Harry.

Hermione was sitting next to Theo, who was sitting on the edge of the sofa in Theo’s arms. She looked up at him.

"Is it too late?"

"Yes," Theo said.

"There are only four people in the world who are able to see that and figure out which rooms are actually common: you, your cousins, your sisters."Hermione couldn’t help but grin at that.

"Of course!" She said.

"We haven’t been around anyone in fifty years."

"That’s a long time," Theo said, looking like he was about to throw up.

"I’ve got more important things to do."Hermione huffed and turned to Draco.

"You better not blow all the candles on the room. We’re not the only ones in the castle."

"We," he said.

"And you?"

"I’m not sure if I’m a good person," she said, taking a step toward the flames.

"I’m more of a madman than a prince."

"Then what?" Draco said, staring at her.No one spoke. For the first time in those five days Draco's eyes were the same color as his fingers, and he was in his boxers. His hair was the same color as his face, but his eyes were not even the same color as his face. The last time he spoke, he seemed to be stuttering. The only way to be sure that he wasn’t getting into a fight was if he accidentally said something stupid. He had a point. But the obvious choice for a fight was the one he made, and now he was playing with his own life.

Draco stood up from his boarders and sat on the edge of his bed, his chest heaving, hands clasped behind his back as he made his way up to the top. He sat down, careful not to topple over, his eyes peering out at the others."I’m sure you’re all very curious about this new name," Harry told him, eyes narrowing down to the floor.

"But why, you are. I never thought I’d have someone like you with me in the Manor."

"How did you know?" Tom asked."I’ve known it’s called Tom since we were two first year Slytherins." Harry shrugged.

"My parents call me Tom."

"Oh, so you were the only one?" came his voice.

"I was, but I was the other wizard who had more power." He smiled.

"You are a good person, I believe."

"You have been a good person, not only in everything but your family too. Your family is strong, you have courage and you are ambitious. You are ambitious when you don’t have any ambitions. You are strong and ambitious, you know that?" Tom smiled.

"You are a Slytherin, and you were the best of the Slytherins."

"I was, but you said I was not. That I was a Hufflepuff." He laughed.

"You now know, Malfoy’s a new friend."Hermione nodded.

"I’m a new friend of yours."He gave a small laugh and turned to leave."Oh, right, you said the same." Draco’s voice was calm and not too loud."The sound is beautiful... "

"I’ll show you it too," Lucius said with a smile."I’ll show you the difference." Hermione rolled her eyes.

"You’re the best."She loved this conversation to the bone.

Hermione’s mind was a mess. She had been studying History of Magic for her NEW for the year. The Goblins had made her witch-bonded kill the Snatchers for the Daily Prophet, and she had no plans to ever return to the castle. However, she was suspicious of the stupid woman's motives, and she had to admit that her parents were apparently an idiot.The next day, she was in the courtyard reading Alchemy, when a particularly odd sight she caught. The entire courtyard was covered in white mist, and a figure stumbled backwards, stopping her in her tracks. He was covered in pale blue cloth, his eyes half-full, and his hair in a bun atop his head. Why does he look so... weird... she thought."C'mon, Harry, you look so much like him..." Hermione darted her fingers through his hair, hoping he wouldn't notice."You look... so light..." Harry said as he fingered the white hair around his neck. He would have to adjust his dress to match, ignoring the blonde hair in the corner.

"Honestly, Hermione, you're not the most beautiful woman I've ever laid eyes on."Hermione felt the snow melt on her face, melting into a soft blanket of warmth.

"I don't know about you, but I'minto you." Harry said, kissing her lips and kissing her forehead, sending a thrill up her spine.

"I like how you look! Can't you do this for me?"

"I think this is for you too. I haven't had the chance to sit here and talk to you at length, but I promise it's not the best idea."

"You're right. I actually don't think I need to explain this to you. You're my friend and I trust you. Especially with your new identity."Hermione felt tears of happiness flow down her face as she said, "You're my mother, my sister."

"If I weren't so upset about it, I'd be angry too. I'm so sorry."

"You're my sister, you're my friend, and I love you." A sadness washed over Hermione as she said, "I don't know what I'd do if I were you. You're my best friend, and I love you more than anything. But I can't tell you that despite what you've been through, you're still my best friend."

"I could tell, I never knew everything, and you were a bit too stubborn, and you were always so impatient. But now, I know."

"You have to teach me how to be a Gryffindor."

"I do. You're my best friend, and you're my best friend. You deserve more than anyone else. I'll be by your side, and I'll make sure you'll be happy for the rest of your life."

"I'll love you, Draco. I'll do everything in my power to make sure you're happy, and happy not a question," sighed Draco.

"It’s a question for my mother."

"How do you know?" Hermione asked, looking up from her book.

"I’m under the impression that you’ve been told the whole truth, and I’m sure you don’t want to hear anything more than that."

"I’m under the impression that you’ve been given permission to tell me," Hermione said.

"I just want to be sure you’re all right."

"I’m fine," Theo said, wiping the tears from his eyes.

"Don’t worry, we’ll see about class."Hermione was already out of her chair when the door opened and Professor Quirrell stepped out of it, looking quite pleased with himself.

"Professor?" he asked, his eyes sparkling with mischief.

"Yes?"

"How do you know?" Hermione asked."I’ve been trying to figure it out while studying magic," Professor Quirrell answered.

"I noticed you mentioning the bond in your first year."

"Yes?" Hermione asked.

"I not sure, I was just wondering. I’m sure I’d miss your reaction to it." Draco smiled.

"I’ll see you in class in a few days."

"What do you want?" Hermione asked, worried that she would be left wondering if she was even listening to the conversation. Draco smiled so brightly that she noticed her silent stare.

"I’m a Gryffindor, so my answer is obvious."

"Can I be more precise?" Hermione asked. Draco shrugged.

"Fine."

"I’m sure you can." Draco smiled as he pulled out his wand.

"How to open a cup?" he asked kindly.

"The wand is easy enough to open with a wandless one because the magic is passed through. It’s like a tap of your hand. The magic doesn’t have to be very powerful or careful, just enough to be passed down from generation to generation."Hermione looked at him. He was impressed with the wandless one.

"I thought you were ugly."

"Seemed to be a bit of a barmy old bastard," Hermione said to Draco.

"Still, I’m impressed that you’re as good as mine."Draco nodded silently.

"I trust that you’ll be as good as mine," he promised. It was a fair bet, but Hermione was sure that they could trust one another."I’m sure it is," Theo replied.

"I’ll be sure to look into it."

"Not that I’m aware of it," Daphne said, not even bothering to pretend to be interested in the topic.

"I’m sure Draco’s already taken the time to answer all sorts of questions about you and Hermione."

"I’ve taken a chance on you, Hermione," Theo said, glancing at his brother.

"It’s a small price to pay for a chance at our dear friendship."

"I’ll say it," Hermione said, looking like she was about to tear up. Theo nodded and went on.

"We have a deal for you. You’ll have to tell me about it."Hermione blinked. She didn’t think she’d ever be able to say this to her. But at the same time, she didn’t care. She had to know what people thought. And what was it they thought about her."I’ll tell you everything then," Theo said obnoxiously.

" even tell you about what happened that night."Hermione just stared at him. She really did love Theo’s poems, but she loved the way he was so human."What happened that night?" She asked in a hushed whisper."I was reading in the library when I came up with the idea that you were the one in a letter." Theo said with a slight smile."I didn’t see you there." Hermione said in a hushed whisper.

"I’m sorry."

"You’ll have to answer me when you’re done reading my letter." Theo said.

" can’t say you didn’t know." Hydrus laughed.

"You’re right, but I couldn’t wait to get that from the very beginning."

"I’ll do my best, Blaise," Theo said with a smile.

"You sound like a Muggle-born, though you’re not half bad."

"It doesn’t really matter," Blaise said.

"He’s more of an American import."

"And his parents are in Romania?" Theo asked, a curious grin on his face.

" they’re all here. I’ll get it," Blaise said as he quickly looked around.

"Now, where are we going?"

"I’d be at the beach," Hermione said, looking around once more.

"I don’t want to be late." She smiled and left the house. 

Hermione and Theo took a boat ride to the beach, heading straight for the water. Hermione was the first to arrive. The waves were soft and calm, the waves sounded very much like the ocean. They turned on a small crystal clear beach that reflected beautifully. The land turned to a small, rectangular beach with beach stones framing the shore. A small island was carved out of the rocky sea floor, and lay a wide open space between the two landings. The landing was dark blue and yellow, with a bright white flamingo perched atop a small beam of white pebbles.A little further in, the landings were much more peaceful. There was a sign posted on the edge of the island, and a small island with a lantern beside it. The landings were very similar, except the landing opposite was a wooden dock.The sun was out that day, and the sun came up slowly. The green lights seemed to come in through the open windows, and the moon appeared in the distance. The landings were laid out before a small clearing, and you'll find a small cave. The path leads into what looks like a burial chamber, and you'll find a small table. I checked, there's a small table attached to it. On the table is a small table with a red velvet cupboard. There's also a small table on the far side of the cave and two chairs. It looks like you've just come from the library, right?" Draco said to me as he looked at me.

"What are you doing here?" I asked as I reached out to place his hand on the ground.
