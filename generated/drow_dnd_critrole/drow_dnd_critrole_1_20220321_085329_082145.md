"Ah, I see." Rhaine said, turning to leave."Keep going!" Khelgar called behind her."I’m a Doomguide!" Khelgar yelled."You don’t have to run!" Khelgar shouted back."I...  I can’t! I can’t!"

"By the gods!" Khelgar yelled in disbelief."No!" Rhaine exclaimed."We have to go!" Khelgar roared."Go!" Rhaine asked, the hound whistling his orders."Wait!" Khel raised his voice in a call to arms.

"Wait!"Suddenly, something caught Rhaine’s eye, and he caught it as she approached, her hand on his shoulder. The hound whirled to face her and her eyes widened, her lips curled into a smile."I...  please, Rhaine." He said with a slow growl."Hush."A few more moments of silence followed, and then he began to speak."The runes are broken!" he called to her.

"The broken ones!"Rhaine’s breath quickened, and she could see the hound’s eyes glowed.

"Cl of the Arcane. It is a black iron ring with a silver shard on the bottom. Only two scabbards lie within the ring, one is in the center and the other in the middle."

"And what would that have been?"The hound’s gaze drifted away, as if in a silent trance, as if she could not remember anything at all. She could not remember what her companion had told her. Rhaine sighed again, closing her eyes.

"It would have been more of a mystery to anyone who was familiar with the hound. They worked with them and they did not harm anyone."

"And what does that mean?" the hound continued, his eyes widening in concern.

"What if she had been harmed?"

"You have no right to ask that question," Rhaine said.

"I can assure you that she was not."

"What questions would you like answered?" he asked.

"Ask her what questions would answer her."

"She has a name," Rhaine answered with a slight chuckle.

"She is Elanee."

"And now," he added, pointing to the sign at the far end of the temple, "name your questions. We will answer them in time."

"Of course," Rhaine said, narrowing her eyes."Well," the drow said, leaning a little on the wall and leaning back in his seat, "we are waiting."

"Wait!" Rhaine exclaimed in astonishment.

"What is it? What is it like? What were the places you led and where did they lead?"The githzerai nodded.

"The Red Woman’s House."

"I am sorry," she said, quietly.

"I didn’t expect she would be asking such questions."

"Then you are telling her that you know of it?"Rhaine shook her head.

"What I need is more answers that, he looked at her.

"You have brought much needed answers to a small village. And I am not just talking about the details of the past. You have brought with you much information concerning the people of Gond who have been lost in the war against the Circle of the Mere."

"And what of the people of Merdelain?" she inquired."That I am sure all of you know," he answered calmly.

"They are people of faith and justice. And while you may have lost faith in them, you have gained justice – and good fortune."

"And if you ever seek justice in this land, he added, leaning down in his seat, his hands still resting lightly on his chest, "you will find it in this court."

"I am not your Judge," Rhaine murmured.

"I have no power over the Mighty Nein."

"You are a fool," he added.

"You think that if you can sway the Court of the Faithless, you will ever find justice in this land?"

"I do not know," she replied easily.

"I have no power to sway the Court of the Faithless, but I can help them."

"I do," he smiled.

"You are nothing alike to them, both in your faith and your deeds. But you are stronger than most."She nodded.

"You are stronger than all the other mortals, both mortal and celestial."He laughed a little at that.

"I am not stronger than all of you, yet I have a claim to your fame, your fortune, and your place in the pantheon of gods."She was almost smiling.Rhaine smiled back at him.

"That is a title I will keep."

"Your place?" He laughed wickedly.

"That title is your fame. You are the first to be named to the position, and that title will be yours forever." looked down at the slate in her hand and smiled into it, "There, Garius."She didn’t need to be told anything. She was ready.------------------------------------------------------Casting myromancy curtain on the dead!"Rhaine was blushing uncontrollably, her mouth hanging open as she started to cast myromancy curtain on the dead! And after a few moments, she hadn’t even been able to see the dust motes in her hand anymore! It was rather odd... "That’s right," she began slowly, her brow furrowing as she looked up at the sand behind the door.

"This is good...  the air is rising She murmured.

"We need to find the source of the fire, and you’ve been good enough to need us."Rhaine nodded and ducked under the door.

"I’ll take you back, then."

"Wait!"The door opened, and the three companions entered the factory. Sand and Fireball stood at the entrance, and the three were immediately introduced to a familiar scene. The workers were all smiling and waving their magic all around, but the faces were decidedly garish in places."I saw a familiar face," Sand remarked.

"I’m Sam," he added, pointing to a large, rectangular box that opened to reveal a very large, plush wooden plate.

"This is the ‘meat pack’." Sam’s mouth dropped open and he looked down at the plate, seemingly expecting something specific to say about the meat pack.

"This is the meat pack," he explained, gesturing to it lazily. Sam shook his head and gestured for the box to open, "to the left of the food pack."

"And the meat pack?" Sand inquired.

"The meat pack that Sam and I both know Sam and I."

"I’m assuming," Sam interjected, glancing to the plate.

" not going to take that risk."

"Well," Steve said, a hand on his elbow.

"You can’t take that risk."Steve shook his head.

"I can never go back. I’ve been here four years, I know what it’s like. I’ve been here for a long time. It’s too much for me."

"You’re right," Sam replied, getting up and walking to the door.

"What are you going to do?"Steve stood on the porch, watching the stars, looking down at the stars. He didn’t even bother to look at the people around him. He saw the people around him as uninterested in the situation at hand. His only interest was to make sure that Caleb wasn’t in the middle of getting something done that would cause him great pain. Caleb’s fingers curled around the door frame and pulled open, closing it behind him so that he could see the people around him. He couldn’t really complain, it was just that he didn’t want them to see anything at all.

They made their way through the small town Essek and Caleb had just arrived in, Caleb felt a twinge of guilt for not stepping up to the door once it closed. It was the only thing they’d been allowed to touch.

"You don’t need to worry about me. I’m just here to-"

"This is it," the door opened. There was a small boy on the floor, an older guy in a chair between two people, and a dog on the bench. The boy was gloved and alert, and he had a face like a bat. It was easy to see the expression on his face that told the whole story of this stranger. He was smiling. He was smiling because he and the boy had been playing with Duncan, trying to find a way to save Duncan’s life. That boy was very proud of them. They were very proud of their dog. He was quite tall compared to her.He had been playing with his wolf for a bit, and she had made sure he was well fed. She had brought him a couple bowls of porridge as well, and watched him eat, relieved that he’d not been a victim of the previous night’s ordeal. He would have been better served eating those once he got himself well, she thought as she ate.

The bowl of porridge was not the only thing Dorian brought. The handful of herbs she had brought was his way of taking care of anything but healing anything, she recalled telling him. He had taken the sunflower oil from her pantry and the tincture he had given her, both of which she had enjoyed, was a warm little thing. It was not just because it was the first time he had worked with her. She had only ever worked with him before. The fact that he had brought it to her personally was a nice touch.

"You’re going to be fine," he said, though she took another deep breath.

"I’m sure you’ll want to stay a while."The girl smiled.

"I think that’s a pretty good plan, it’s just," she said, and there was a long pause. Then, just as quietly, she nodded and made her way over to the drow, her companions, and Velatha.
