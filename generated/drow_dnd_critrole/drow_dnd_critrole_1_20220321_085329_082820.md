Rhaine leaned against the door with a slow sigh and a smile as she opened it, looking up at the firbolg.

"Amber Heard?" she asked, looking down at the air genasi’s smug face as they opened the door to the ballroom.

"Do you think she’s going to play?"

"She’s a good actress," the firbolg said, as they turned the corner into the backstage area.

"But, I’m not sure that makes her character any better."

"Well," Rhaine replied, distancing herself from the firbolg, "I’ll try." well," he replied, placing his hands on the backs of his knees and shaking his head.

"Please, don’t hurt me."She sighed, swallowing heavily. She didn’t think he would hurt her, and he certainly wouldn’t."Well," he said, voice halting, uncertain, "I guess for now. I’ll just wait it out."She smiled a little.

"I can’t really say a lot."His brow furrowed.

"You know Rhaine, you’re so used to dealing in small talk."She smiled, taking a deep breath.  you like to know, Lathander?" He sounded genuinely curious, his voice even quieter when he spoke."I think so," she answered with a slow nod.

"I’ve been thinking a lot about that."

The elf offered a little smile. He was more than a little curious about this particular matter, and they were quite close on that front.Finally, his curiosity was satisfied. The conversation moved on to a more pressing topic. Rhaine asked him what he had learned concerning the Red Woman and her connection to the Circle.The demilich shook his head, giving her a brief nod and a smile before turning his attention to the half-elf he said, crossing his arms.

"You look very tired, but I am sure I can manage."She shrugged.

"It is how it is."

"Chet," he said, holding his hand out in a gesture of thanks.

"I wish you luck."

"I am glad you wish to retire," she said, a look of concern etched into her face.

"But I know the time is right."

"I will retire, hagspawn," he said, rolling his shoulders back and giving her a smile.

"If you wish."She did not know that Rhaine had kissed her, but there had been no hint of it."I have," she replied with a smile, eyes full of a given awe.

"It is a small thing. But I think it is worth trying."

"Try it," the pale woman said, touching her hand to her chest and nodding.

"I will."Suddenly, the Doomguide’s eyes grew wide. There was a knock at the door, but the door creaked loudly upon entry."Rhaine!" the pale woman exclaimed, gesturing to her companions.

"What are you doing here?"

"I did not ask," Rhaine replied with a snort.

"I was looking for a way to reach the Doomguide directly. If you are so inclined, I can teach you some common 'emere ril."Rhaine wished her good luck, and began to search for her companions again. It was not long before they vanished in the direction she had come upon, and she felt certain that they had found her.------------------------------------------------------They returned to the grove, and with them the Doomguide, Safiya and Ammon. They had both been stripped of their rings, and so the companions began to cross the bridge of the bridge to find them. The Doomguide’s new owner, a dwarf named Turot, was quite gentle with her.

"I think I may return to your side, once we’re settled."The dwarf was a gnome, and he was quite familiar with the layout of the city’s walls. He would often strip us down to our own brig and have us sleep in the back of a cart, so he would sometimes haul us over to the south tower so that we could explore the tunnels further. I’d met him, he was the first to arrive, and we explored the tunnels further under the guise of merchants. He was quite fond of us, and I think he trusted him enough to let us stay one night for as long as we needed." He was a little drunk, but otherwise un and she had an idea.

The first thing he said was, "I think one way or another, I think I’ll be a better student than Dez. I think you’ll be better than her because of that," he said at last, holding his hand out towards a table and sitting down, rubbing his forearm. She didn’t say an ounce of protest, just easy agreement. He smiled vaguely at her.

"Okay, you two, then. We’ll leave the other students of our ‘schools’ in peace."

He was not done with them. Dez was now his number one student, his name given to every student who had contributed to his study, as well as every student who did not wish to continue. He would always ask me if I would like to begin teaching him some basic material, and I would gladly take any portion of his studies and let him take pride in the fact that he had put his life on the line once before. He would even ask me to teach him some new spell if I had not already, since he was so new to the role. He always wondered if I had taken more of his lessons, and I would answer him honestly when he asked, and it was the only way I knew how. It was the only way I knew how to repay him.

Irae’s eyes grew wide.  She said with a chuckle.Irae could understand the frustration of the man. He deserved to be punished for everything. Not his past, not his parents, not even his sister. But he deserved to get out of the house and move on, to live a normal life. He could live off the fame he’d earned through his exploits in the bounty hunting community, off the drugs he’d taken, off his body and on his sword. He could live his life as a proud warrior, proud owner of a sword, proud leader of a kingdom, proud lover. He could lead his people on good times and bad times, not be an ass. He could die trying to find new lives to help spread the good news of his blessed new state. Especially after seeing what he had in common with the likes of Elasha and Nadine. It was odd, to see the elven women he’d fallen so far behind. He’d been quite the popular member already, earning him a place in the royalty ranks and getting some coin from the merchants he’d met. He’d just barely been promoted to a captain when the rumors started to spread.

"I’m glad you’re proud," he said quietly.

"You’ve shown me that you still have some work to do."The elf woman chuckled.

"I’m not the sort to let anyone take a life without a clear motive. I’m sure you’ve heard the excuses I keep hearing them sometimes use. But why do you ask?"

"Because you do not believe in exceptions to the law."At that, Rhaine paused, feeling somewhat alarmed at the statement.

"I’ve been told exceptions to the law are never exceptions. I have never had a case where I wished to take a life. But I do not believe that such exceptions are out of bounds," she added.

"In fact, they may be used to make exceptions to the law."

"Then we need to take a look at the Statute of Limitations Rhaine remarked with a raised eyebrow."Yes," Kaelyn answered with a snort.

"It is one of the oldest and most widely used laws in the Church of Never."

"And the Statute of Limitations is the same as the Statute of Faith?" Rhaine asked, looking back at the Doomguide with a wide smile."Yes," the gith replied with a slight bow of her head.

"It is a simple matter of law. You must be of good faith, and you must surrender the Sword of Gith if you are to proceed with your mission."The gith bowed once again, and then her brow fur "Well, I’ve hardly heard my name called before your arrival."

"I am sorry," Rhaine said, lowering her gaze politely.

"I feared that I had no time to rest."

"Well, I’m glad you’re well," the gith replied, turning back to Rhaine.

"You’re welcome. You must return to the barrow quickly."The Doomguide took a deep breath before returning her attention to the companions.

"I’ll be back soon. Shall I go?"

"Go, now," Rhaine said, turning back to the Watch to take a look around the prison. It was dimly lit, the walls almost pitch black and covered in a layer of damp, moldy soil. At least five stonework boxes had been closed and equipped with latches, allowing guards a clear line of sight as the stonework collapsed."Come on, let’s go," Khelgar said, stepping up beside Rhaine.

"We have a few minutes."They had stopped in their tracks, gasping as they saw two more boxes being opened. Khelgar looked at them, and then at Rhaine.

"Wait. Wait, you aren’t waiting for me."The stonework boxes had collapsed once more and the two companions had simply been staring at each other, staring at each other."You don’t have to. I’m taking you back to the temple," Rhaine finally whispered, feeling her heart sink."No!"At that, Fjord shook his head, jerking his hand towards the doorway.

"I don’t think we have time. We’re here to serve you."

"Ah," Neeshka mumbled, a smile pulling at her lips, "and you are our brother."At that, Rhaine’s heart skipped a beat.
