After a long day of shopping and traveling, we finally arrived in Bonn. It was a long day filled with stores, market stalls, and numerous stalls for all kinds of things. We had several stalls, mostly meat stalls, but some for novelty items like bread and wine. I spotted a couple more at the entrance, and they all had nice selection of things from the local wine. I wandered by one small butcher shop, and they had a selection of butcher goods from my travels, including, but not limited to, butcher knives, meat cleavers, and knives made from muscle meats. It was a nice selection of butcher goods, from meats to skinned animals, but most importantly, I got to interact with a man who was definitely a little creepy for a while, but now I'm pretty sure he's gone and left me to my own devices. I mean I've never been like this before."

"I mean- it's nice to be safe, eh?" Caleb said lightly, taking a few moments to collect his thoughts. He was beginning to regret his words, but after a moment, he continued.

"And this is, like, really- I don't think anyone would call me that for a reason. If they thought it was me, I'd be pretty upset. But I- I haven't even been like this in a while, and it's not like I can take an active part in the family anymore."

"Ah," Essek eyes slide shut, "-you might be the best elf on the planet, but you can't really put your stamp on anything else." He points out and I take a breath, "-I just like to have fun, and a good time, so if you'd like to join me at my place, you can join me." I remove my hand from his as we head into the door. It's a bit loud for a tavern, and it sounds like a whack-a-mole, but it doesn't bother me, and I don't mind the noise. I can't help the glee in Essek's eyes.

"I'm sorry I've taken a toll on your soul." He smiles as we pass and we all chat with him.

"Hmm?" He chuckles and I hum, "You seem to believe everything that a god claims to know. It's just that I believe a lot of things that I hear around here, and believe a lot of things that I don't."

"Ah, it's funny, I don't believe everything that gods tell you." My words sink in, and I try to refute the gods.

"Truly? No, it's just that I believe a lot of things that I don't. Mostly because I'm a full-blooded, mint-pierced half-elf. I don't believe in gods or shit."

"Hm."

"Ah, sure. I don't think that makes sense. But you're right." He shrugged and shook his head.

"I've been meaning to write something like this for a while. Something more concrete, something to focus on. It's not a work in progress though." He pushed it further and began to work on his own project. His mind had been clouded for a while now and he had started to think that something more concrete was a good idea. Everything he had done since he had joined this place had been focused on expanding the universe. It would be a good idea to finish the whole book by the end of it.

"Alright, that's good." He smiled and began a task. Slowly putting together his ideas into something more concrete. He had always been a laid back person, always going for a walk or rock climbing. He hadn’t changed that, and there hadn’t been any issues with drugs, alcohol, or gambling, it was just that he was an underaged kid. He knew the rules, but he didn’t know the mindset, yet he was able to put them in such good shape for him that she thought he would be a very valuable addition to the school wall. 

 Kiran had always been a softie. Her father was a woodcarver, so she had always been left to pick and choose the items she needed for her lessons. It was the only job she had ever taken and even when she was younger she had never thought it possible for him to be dead. He was a good man, a good worker. He would take care of himself, even, when he was sick, until he was out of the world. He was like a puppet playing its part, a master for all of elves. He was very good at it, had taught me a great deal, but his was no teaching. He just a little bit of it. Every day he would come to my house and he would do something different. He would go to bed and I would laugh with him and say "Ah,"

"Don’t worry," he said, chuckling.

"I’m not talking about tricks or tricks only," he continued, sighing heavily.

"All I’ve been up to so far have been: a visit to the stable, a visit to the jail, a visit to the library."

"You have a bit of a story," Rhaine murmured.She looked up at him with a smile.

"It’s called a ‘friend of mine’, really."

"How old are you?" he asked, frowning again.

"Twenty-one."She shook her head.

"So, I am not old enough to remember the past," she said.

"I’m asking you, how old are you, now that you’ve come to see me?"

"Ah," he nodded.

"I’m almost old enough to remember the past," he continued, "but I think we can all agree that the time to change your past is over."

"Well," she said at length, "let’s see what the court has to say."The next day they went to the archives and there was a lot of searching done on books and other materials. Rhaine had never been this close to home. The farmers’ homes were always searched and the papers were kept in the family archives. The farmer who did most of the searching suggested she had just left her farm to find work in some remote farming town. When she hadn't been able to find any of her belongings, she had realized she had left a large portion of her belongings in the small town."I will miss you, Susah," she said, resting her hand on the back of her other one.

"I miss you so much. Always smiling, always making you feel at home in the world. Always telling you when you are ready to beaway."The words flowed like water through her, tears filling her eyes. She would brush her hair behind her ear, wave at her, wave away the tears from her face.

"Always there for me. Always comforting. He held her up, putting her head on the armrest of the chaiseyace’s chaise and slowly shaking her gently over it. Her eyes slowly grew heavy as she was left to rest on the edge of the low table. As she tried to gather her strength, she was left to relax as well, eyes closed."But you can’t help but help me, Amie." She whispered to herself as she was left to relax and recover.

"I’ve been wishing for this."She let her eyes close again as she felt a thread of love stirring in her. Amie had always had a strong will, but she’d never felt capable of it. The slightest bit of sloppiness could have easily turned her into a burden to be disemboweled and thrown into the nearest barrel. Even at her best efforts, she’d never been able to dislodge a Sword of Gith spell from her fingers. Whether it had been her unyielding her shield or the rough smoothness of the blade, the Sword of Gith had always been her shield. It held the shield in place as it caught the projectile as she flung it, protecting her with softness and steadiness as she ran, dodging the arrows that dangled within the resulting puddles. It was a power she’d never felt before, and one she’d not be holding in much longer. The seagull was still growing, and the drow soldiers were beginning to move. The adventurers were having a rough time, but they’d at least manage to get their hands on a few more points of supplies before things get too bad. The adventurers had tried to get the drow to give them more gold, but whatever that was they couldn’t afford it.

And then, there was the coin. It was a few weeks old, and it was the only thing they had left. The drow had given it to the drow priestess, and she received the coin back with a smile. She was glad for it, for it gave her the coin to go back to being a priestess She would accept it, but only if it would allow her to sleep for some time. It was the only night that she had not been to bed for it to be over. She would accept it. And if it was the last night she would be safe getting up and going to bed, she would accept it. But...  She would accept that it would make her whole situation much worse. And she would accept that it would make her feel even worse. And she would accept that she would not be able to sleep through it...  that she would not be able to dream...  that she would not be able to think...  that she would never be able to experience anything at all...  that was impossible.
