"Theories abound," Gwynnestri pointedly pointedly pointedly observed, "but the core theory is the most likely theory to emerge."

"That’s...  quite right," interrupted Rhaine, eyes wide.

"We’re all dealing with uncertainty."

"Hnnnh!" she exclaimed, bringing a hand to her chin, placidly smiling as she flew to her feet.

"That’s the crux of the matter. The only theories we know are the ones that have been around for a while."

"Indeed," the Doomguide continued, "and I would say that the only reason I know that the old One never visited you was because the only reason I know you are his. He was too busy at home to bother you, and he seemed content to simply watch you suffer in silence."

"I’m sorry," Rhaine said softly, a tear falling from her eye.

"I’m so sorry."

"I know," she said, a smile curling across her face.

"It’s all part of the charm."

"It’s all part of the charm," Ammon replied softly.

"I’m sorry, Ammon."

"And what could you possibly do exactly?" Rhaine asked, wondering why Ammon would have offended her so much."Nothing," the wizardess replied softly.

"I’m just a warrior."

"If you have any questions, ask them," Ammon snapped, though his tone was almost casual.

"I’ve got a bridge to the Moon Garrison and I’ll be right there."

"I’ll be right there," Rhaine answered with a nod.

"I’ll be right there too."

"Good," the wizardess replied with a smile, nodding to Rhaine.

"You have my thanks, but a hand is always a welcome sight."The Doomguide was silent for a long moment, her gaze drifting over her companions.

"I’m glad you all seem well, then. And it seems like the only way to defeat the King of Shadows effectively is to defeat the spirit-eater."

"I don’t see how that’s an option," Ammon added with a snort.

"The only way to do that is to eat the King of Shadows."

"That sounds like a very realistic goal," Khelgar added, "and I am a very real person. I am going to have to work with you more closely, she said at length.

"And it’s going to feel rather...  strange."She let her eyes close.

"Please?"She didn’t expect the elf to be her partner. Her brow furrowed.

"You’re not a romantic, you know."

"I am not a romantic," Rhaine said darkly, "I only know that you’re trying to get to the bottom of things. And you’re attempting to find me."

"I don’t want to go anywhere," Safiya said sternly.

"I’ll meet with you later. I can do something about this if you need it now."

"What...  what are you going to do?" Kaji asked, his voice hushing her."I don’t know. I just don’t have the energy to do anything right now."

"What...  what do you mean?" Rhaine asked, brow furrowed.

"What you mean by that?"

"Yeah, I guess you can’t do anything at all right now. I don’t know why."

"Well," the Doomguide interrupted, "I don’t know anymore. I just need to...  Go back to the Beacon. She looked down at her bag, trying to ignore the tears in her eyes. She tried to grab a map of the area, but found it difficult to find places to go to. It seemed like a small group of mages were trying to get back to the Beacon, but the people seemed to know where to go, and so they just left. In the end, she found that her search came back empty handed. The drow still stood over her, face turning a shade of red as she spoke to Angel. She said nothing, only silently transcribing the words on the paper and taking it back to the drow who took it back. It was then that Nimor went back to his journal and wrote down what he had done in that instant. He had thought it was a rather regular thing, but when the drow called him back, he knew he would be back to it soon. He had planned on writing it out, with a few exceptions, but he had always had a solid plan in mind. He closed his eyes and rolled his eyes, taking a breath for a few moments to cool. He knew he was dreaming, but he didn’t know why. He was paying attention, and when the drow called again, the day was officially here. He closed his eyes again, and when he reopened them again, he felt something in them; a strange warmth in his chest.

She was right. The more I thought about it, the more I thought it must be happening, and when she said the words aloud, she was making a statement. What was she doing? He was not the only member of his party who had eaten crow, and she was not the only member of his party who had had a cold. He had not even asked her name.

He must have been telling her she was a trap, because the songbird who had been blushing at the beginning of the song had been blushing again when he had finally finished, and now she was blushing even more.

She was not a virgin. Not a girl who had been in the military. Not a virgin who had had a bad time. Not a virgin who had gone through the hard times of her life, or the tribulations of her lifetime. Her life didn’t matter. It was okay. She was a soldier by blood, and she was a soldier by blood. She was a soldier by blood. She had the right to be here. She had the right to be proud. She had the right to be here with her friends. She had the right to behave. She had the right to behave. She knew a soldier by blood, and she knew she deserved to be treated with respect. She knew a soldier by blood, and she was proud of that. She knew a soldier had been murdered in her regiment, and she knew that the other soldier at the time had been wounded badly. The former had been killed, and the latter had been killed badly. The former soldier had been defeated. The former soldier had been decided. The latter had been decided. If she was to be a true survivor, then she needed to know more than just the corpses."You are a proud survivor." The woman said, her voice as low and clear as a fog."I am a proud warrior." She spoke not a lie, but genuine thought."I am a proud leader." She said it with a proud heart."A true leader does not lie." He grinned, holding her up at the top of his gun.

"The king is his king."Safiya’s eyes were wide.

"A true leader may lie."

"A true leader does not lie."

"A true leader does not lie!"

"A true leader does not lie for the queen!"

"A true leader does not lie for the drow!"Safiya was smiling happily.

"A true leader does not lie!" The elven priestess nodded, clambering out of the shadows and practically skipping over the first pair of doors.

"A true leader does not lie for the queen!" He shouted, and the crowd roared in rage.

"A true leader does not lie for the queen!"A confused look formed on the Queen’s face for a moment, then she shook her head in dismay.

"I do not know who planted this seed."

"It is not you!" Kaelyn’s voice warned, echoing the crowd’s rallying cry.

"It is not you!"

"It is not me!" Rhaine retorted.

"I want to know who planted this seed!"

"I know!" Kaelyn cried.

"You planted it! You planted it with the king!" knew it!" Rhaine exclaimed, all hands on deck.

"The evidence pointed to the seed! It was planted in the city when we arrived and the king was there with his lieutenants...  and a few servants."

"Agreed!" Rhaine exclaimed.

"I bet your friends knew about it!"The Doomguide’s face was grim.

"I’m sure they did. But I still hope they didn’t kill us."

"I would have spared them all," Kaelyn answered.

"I’m sure they did."

"If they’re worried," El added, "they were right. We’re all in luck – the goblins have a stable, not a prison."

"Elanee, I’m afraid we have a bit of a problem," Rhaine quipped.

"We need to get to the stable first."

"Right," the elf replied with a nod of approval.

"We’re headed for the stable."

"Ok," Rhaine nodded again, shaking her head.

"Go, quickly!"

"Ah," the gnome added with a grin.

"We’re heading to the stable."

"And where’s the business?" Rhaine asked, inclining her head to him.

"The band has returned. You don’t need to fight – take a risk and a reward."

"Rhaine!"He smirked.

"I’m going to fight the band, then."

"You’re right," she replied, plainly.

"I will fight."There was a flash of light and a metallic ring to his ring-of-sight visage. He followed it through the corridors and into the airlock, and from the crack of the door slid a large crystal ball, bearing the visage of his childhood friend and assassin He looked back at me and grinned.

"You want to see my face," he said, letting out a deep breath.

"See-"

 I couldn’t believe it, I was so close to tears. 

 "Can’t-" I said, looking at him, giving him a heavy sigh.

"I’m sorry for taking so long."

 He held his hand up to my eyes.

"I’m sorry," he said, nodding his head.

"I’m sorry.
