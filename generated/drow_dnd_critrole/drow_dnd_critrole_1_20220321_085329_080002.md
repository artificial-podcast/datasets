"How do you know he’s still alive?"

"I’m sorry," Rhaine said, trembling slightly.

"I’m sorry. I didn’t see him coming."

"He must have been very concerned," Khelgar said gently, leaning back in his chair.

"I think he saw a flash of light and saw the small pair of us descending the stairs. He was very close to parting us, but we were unable to do so."

"Did he try to kiss you?" Shandra asked, darkening her eyes.

"He did."

"What happened?" Khelgar asked.

"I couldn’t see him, but he saved us. I couldn’t see you. I thought he was going to tell me what happened to his son by now, but... "

"What?" Rhaine asked, genuinely surprised.She nodded.

"I was going to say he saved us, but he killed my mother and ate her alive."He paused, and looked her over.

"Didn’t he?"

"Yes, but what happened?" Rhaine asked, a tear rolling down her cheek.At that, the Doomguide’s brow furrowed deeply.

"Did he kill me?"

" the wizardess replied, a smirk frolicking across her lips.

"No. I was merely assisting him in his attempt to kill me. It was not murder, but it was my duty."

"Did he?"Rhaine glanced to her friend, puzzled.

"Did he?"

"No," the Doomguide replied, dipping her head respectfully.

"He did not use us. He did not intend for us to be his accomplices."

"I...  I don’t think so," she continued.

"So," she paused, "what is he doing? Do you think he was attempting to turn himself in?" Calculation is how Icestrynric Wizard Djafi found himself playing a minor role in a very real and unlikely scheme to defraud the god of the land of the living. There was only one way to know for certain that the man was merely using him as a means to an end; they had to know who he was using him to target."I’m not using him," he muttered to himself as he prepared to, again, cast his own spell.

"I’m using him for one thing-"

"And what are you doing, Rhaine Alcinea?" He asked, brow furrowed.

"I’m using you for something else, and I’m not afraid to share," he replied, gesturing to her slightly.

"See you in the morning, hmm?"They trotted over to the fireplace, the firbolg and his newly-arrived successor, Elanee, alighted on the fire and saluting Rhaine’s name. Rhaine was silent for a moment, turning her gaze to Elanee, who had sat on the side of the bed as they had before they had begun their morning ritual.

"I love you, little one," she said at length, the hint of an almost innocent smile to her lips.

"I miss you, too." small smile crept up her lips, and the tears from her eyes came streaming down her cheeks.

"You’ll always be there for me."

"What a wonderful person you are!"The Doomguide couldn’t wait to become his side, but she knew that it would be a slow process. She tried her best to be as kind as possible, but each time, she felt as if she herself was at fault. She glanced down at the altar before her, and her eyes were wide with emotion.

"Thank you. I’m so sorry, and I’m so sorry I can’t... "There was a long pause, and then her eyes met mine, her lips parting. There must be something wrong with him...  something that he must be sitting with her. It was a strange, strange place, and I couldn’t help but wonder if a goblin could be here. Her gaze moved from mine to hers, and then back to mine. I tried to stop my eyes from missing anything, or from falling to my knees before her. Gods, I couldn’t let this happen.------------------------------------------------------Duncan continued to watch me. He was out of breath, but he was making progress towards a stupor. He glanced at me, and I tried to shift back a little, to stand against him. He couldn’t, and the worst part was that he had to stick to his feet and not attack. He’d had enough of that approach, and it was only the briefest of touches that had saved his life.He’d been in the middle of the fight when a pair of guards stopped him from approaching. It hadn’t been a fight, but Tali had seen a certain weakness in his form. He didn’t look up, either, and when his guards tried to pull him towards them, the rookie had sprung for them, allowing them to take him down easily enough. As the guards took his form into their hands, he looked up, and when he drew his sword, he swung it gracefully, drawing the power of his spirit to the side."I am the Nine, my soul. I control the spirits of the dead, the spirits of the living. This is my job," Rhaine answered, gesturing towards the portal.

"It is my honor. I will go first."The portal opened and Rhaine fell to her knees, shaking her head as she took the shards from her bag and bowed deeply to Lord Nasher."For the love of Myrkul," Nasher growled, his voice ringing on the walls.

"These shards were for you. You have done more for this cause than I have."He then turned to the remaining companions, standing before a small crystal sphere that glowed in the moonlight.

"That was a murderer’s trap!"

"Who is it?" Rhaine asked, looking at the crystal sphere as it glowed."The killer responsible for snuffing the lives of three elven priests."Priest Khelgar called out to him, spear drawn.

"Khelgar!"

"We have a traitor in our midst!"

"She is not dead!"

"She is alive!"

"She is not dead!"

"She is not dead!"

"She is not dead!"

"He is!"

"He’s here! here!"

"He’s here!"

"He’s here!"

"He’s here!"Shandra’s eyes widened.

"Look!"

"Look!"They stopped staring at the ground.

"Shandra!"Suddenly, the blood draining from her face was nothing to be sneered at. It was pure elven blood."Is he dead?"A few rangers came out of their wood.

"He’s here."

"He’s here!"

"He’s here!"

"He here!"The threesome began to storm the farm house. One of them joined them directly in the doorway.

"There. Are you all right?"There was a loud crash and a thump.

"The threesome!" The farmer shouted."They’re coming."

"They’re coming."

"Are you all right?"

"I...  I don’t think so."

"I’m...  sorry."The farmer’s face was grim.

"I’m...  sorry. I don’t know. I just thought something might happen. I saw a guy get jumped and I thought maybe he’d come along with me. I never even saw him. I was so surprised. He seemed really, really nice to me."

"What was that about?" Natasha asked, careful not to stir a bit.

"Nothing really," the drow said lightly.

"I just thought a guy wasn’t too far away."

"You think this is going to end with him?"

"I think it will be," the Mighty Nein agreed easily, and Natasha could only hope she hadn’t said anything that way—for they were at a loss on what to do with the rest of their memberships.

"I think it's good that you've seen me come to terms with my past, and I think it's good that you're willing to do what's right for you. It's good that you know what it means to have a part in something that you may or may not have done wrong."

"I know you don't," Caleb protested.

"I admit, I've never been a part of a crime-ridden world before."

"Hmph," Essek came, still standing before the door.

"I'm sure we're used to it."

Caleb only grinned.

"You're very used to it, you know."

"I'll be sure to find a new home, if you like," he said at once and Caleb felt a bit of pride.

"I would have given any—"

"You would have found an old house that had not been razed by the war, and would likely not have needed to be razed again, and lived in a mansion that had not been destroyed and whose roof had not been blown up, and whose roof had not been blown down," she said, and Caleb felt like he had just been talking to himself.

"Ah, I think I know what you mean," Caleb said, and felt his own words sink in, though he was sure it would feel bad at the time.

"What about you?" she asked, and she looked up at him with an amused expression.

"Why don’t you go practice with your knife and practice with your friend?"He grinned again.

"If you don’t mind."She pressed further, and he could feel her tense up as she went, smiling a little at him and nodding to her.

"I don’t mind."That was a lie. He didn’t want to hear it, but he was very aware of how much he loved how he looked like a statue of himself, how he had been carved up by all the people who’d tried to save him, and how he had been brought back to him by an honorable request – to have his head shaved, too. One more time, I think."

"It's a nice change of pace," Essek laughed.

"You know, you're the only one that really gets beaten up in this city."

"Oh, I'm sorry, Essek," Caleb tried not to laugh as he watched his Lieutenant be forced down a flight of stairs, then across the street, and into an even more awkward position.
