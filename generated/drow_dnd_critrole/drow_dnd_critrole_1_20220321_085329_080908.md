The pair would be attending a concert once again, this time at the Foxy Towers, but this time they would be taking place within the Foxy Towers. Vanya and Shandra would swap places as they had been training for the past two weeks, to be exact. And Laudna and Qara would be following after her. And then...  Well, they knew, now they did. And the problem was, they knew a secret. The duo knew all the secrets. The worst one was known for, like, a while ago. The best would be known for, like, a while ago. But they knew all the secret the best was known for. Shandra and Shandra and the other two people, Sh were the most important. They had plans, plans to keep. They had plans. And they weren’t satisfied with that. They weren’t satisfied with just being the drudge drunks. They needed a home. So they came to Luskan, and they found a fireplace and they went to it. The whole time they were like 'I don’t want to die.' It was dark, and it was dark outside, and they knew they were going to die, and they knew. They knew they were going to die. They knew they would be here for a reason. They had plans. They knew they would be perfect. They would be perfect. The dark inside of the place was perfect for this. The dragon’s claw moved around the dragon’s face as it strode past, his white wings soaring as they flew over the dragon’s head to meet it."Your drow friends...  they are our best friends."

"What do you know about them?"

"I have no knowledge of them."

"The Wood Man," Rhaine said with a smirk.

"They are legends. Stories. Not true legends, but legends nonetheless."

"And what is their name?"

"The names of my brothers and sisters...  the names of my people...  the names of my people."

"And what do you plan to do about it?" Rhaine asked.She nodded her understanding grimly.

"I’ll just finish the books and head back to Neverwinter."------------------------------------------------------Once they had finished writing, they all began to depart the Neverwinter mountains for the West Harbor Bridge, where they would meet with the Red Woman. Rhaine carefully placed one hand on the Red Woman’s shoulder, and looked her over with the other; the Red Woman was smiling warmly."Can I help you with this?" Rhaine asked, turning and walking with the Red Woman."That you may be help," the Red Woman said, inclining her head.

"My sister’s name is Callum."

"She’s a healer," Natasha said."Yes, she is."

"Who are your sister-"

"You may know any of her," Natasha said.

"I have no idea. You’d have to ask her directly."

"Her name is Callum," Natasha answered.

"You’d see her in the theatre."

"Not the theatre," Natasha replied.

"I mean that not, of course, but she is a singer. I’m guessing you’d think I was a singer too."

" you." Elias said, and the way his lips parted widened in surprise.

"What are you talking about? I thought you were a singer, now I know you didn’t."

"I’m not a singer," Kaji said, drawing Elias’ attention to his face.

"I was just thinking."The way the smile faded into a soft mew dipped in blood, the way he leaned forward, a half-formed jaw flexed upwards, looked like it had been created by a well-formed mandible.

"I’m sorry." He said, looking up at the rookie.

"I’m sorry." The words came out fast and furious, though not at the same intensity.

"That’s not how it works." She could not believe it."You didn’t run from me." He laughed, a small smile on his lips.

"I’m sorry I made you do it." He leaned over the small boy, reaching between his legs and pulling them open.

"It was a long time coming."

"Did you ever run from me?" She asked, excitedly."No. I’d just as soon as I’d been in the middle of the road." He laughed again, a small smile.

"Well, I did good deeds, rest your peace." He smiled again."Good. Now, to the trouble my mother had you and your friends through." Stevonnie’s eyes widened.

"Do you really believe that I would have done the same thing?"

"I could." Stevonnie said with a shake of their head.

"But you could have guessed it was you."

"Yes." Stevonnie repeated, shaking their head.

"You could have."

"That’s... "

"What?" The other two looked at each other.

"That’s...  Red Riding P... "

"Little Red Riding P!" The dwarf said, mentally shaking his head.

"We’re going to go back to the old days. We’re going to go to the Moon Tower and kill everyone in the city."

"Alright," the dwarf began, but the dwarf had his arm in the air and had his eyes closed.

"We’re going to go back to the Moon Tower and kill everyone."

"It’s too dangerous." Both wizards jumped up and over the dwarf and the dwarf.

"We’re not going to let them."

"We have a plan was a little more than a little surprised when Wyl Mossfeld, her lieutenant, arrived with Shandra and the rest of the Neverwintan contingent to Crossroad Keep. In the temple, they found the paladin Khelgar and his companions, where they encountered the Doomguide and their fellow gnomes. The Doomguide was eager to ask them questions, and as it was, Rhaine had asked Shandra herself a number of times. Shandra had always been very curious, and when she mentioned she had an idea, the Doomguide had been quite interested in it. Rhaine had answered her several times, but Rhaine had always laughed."Yes?" she had said at length, feeling a twinge in her gut."Yes," he replied, a hint of a smile on his lips.

"No, I don’t think so. I was wondering when you would be here."She had laughed.

"I wonder about your friends here, Rhaine Alcinea."

"Ah," he grinned at her.

"They’re your group, from now on," he continued, "for whom I’d like to go. Everyone knows the deception spell."Rhaine glanced down at him, and she smiled gently at him again.

"You know, I have some that you might like. When the door opened again, he looked up at Rosalind.

"You going to stay here for a while?"

 "No," she replied, shaking her head.

"I’m going to stay here for a while."

 "Good? You don’t think you’ve got something to lose by staying here," Elias interjected, "what with me."

 "I don’t think you’re lost," Elias said, relaying it in his mind.

"You’re going to lose everything."

 "I not losing anything, just don’t expect it, she’s a worthless whore," he finished."You don’t want me to see you like this," she spat at him, wiping her hands on her bra.

"You don’t want my ass to feel like this, you want me to feel like this." He grinned.

"You’re going to lose your mind." He was clearly talking to himself.

"Fine," Saturn grumbled.

"You can’t beat me like that!" He tossed the towel in the tub and tossed his erection into the trash can. Her face was cont into a horrified expression, and another bulge crept across her buttocks.

"I think I’m going to need to go." Ashton groaned, pulling their friend back. They didn’t have a moment to let the drow drop.

"I’ll just go ahead and. It’s a spare moment." Ashton grumbled, getting the rest of the group to stand behind them. They didn’t have to move for it to get any attention. The two genocides were happening behind the curtains, and the audience enjoyed all the action. The moment was cut off, however, and after a few seconds, a familiar hand slipped from their pack. They looked around, and they saw what had become of the other two mages. The drow soldiers were gone, once again. Rhaine giggled, "Oh, look, Kiran! There are still two of you!"The Doomguide’s eyes widened.

"Araman!"

"Araman!"

"Araman... "

"Araman... "

"Araman... "The drow soldiers took their time, but they could not stop them. They were impossible to defeat, and the only way to do it would be to strike first. After a few seconds, they fell silent."Rhaine!"The Doomguide’s eyes widened again as she heard another voice on the other side of the partition, this time from the Lathanderite."Safiya!"Shandra screeched, running towards the Lathanderite with animal-like grace.

"Leave the road," she called to them.Rhaine’s eyes slowly widened.

"I thought you were gone," she began, face changing as she saw the Lathanderite turn.

"I thought you were gone."

"We’re with you," the Lathanderite addressed them, her voice barely above a choked whisper.

"We’re allies!"

"What are we allies with, Safiya?" Bishop was saying. The Lady of the Dance was making her way around the ballroom floor and onto the stage with a soft, almost reverent voice. When she had finished speaking, she turned and leaned into the door."I have a task for you, my knight, my friend," she began, crossing her arms. She waved a hand.

"Go open the doors. Let’s go."Bishop, too, hopped up and flew into a stupor. He turned and picked up the offending parcel. He took it into his own hands and brought it down the hall.
