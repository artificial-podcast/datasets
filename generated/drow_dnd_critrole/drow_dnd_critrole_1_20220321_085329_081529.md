Elias – the new sage – has spent the bulk of the past year bouncing from town to town. Transformed, he has come to see his new town through the eyes – not through flesh or hair or eyes. It is utterly clear to him – even with the aid of his mind – that he is the master of this town. He has brought his people to us, brought them to him, brought them to us with the promise of better things. He has brought misfortune. He has brought misfortune. And has brought misfortune. And has brought misfortune.

He has brought misfortune. And has brought misfortune.

And has brought misfortune. Unbound by anything more than the chance to be – and he has come to seek out and kill it."

"Well, it is a pity that you are unable to procure her royal executioner."

"My lord, I would like to keep her company," Rhaine replied.

"Please, have her taken me to her master. The executioner will be sent to the town of Ember. She will be sent to the prison town of Neverwinter."There was a pause.

"And," he replied with a nod, "you’re good enough for the job," he continued, "you’re all needed by daybreak."

"Good," Rhaine replied preeningly, eyes wide.

"I let you go. I’ll write to you again in due time, then."The Doomguide quickly followed up with a small circle to her and nodded her acceptance.

"You have several hours to find a cabin in the mountains, as I have now."

"Good," Ammon answered with a slight sigh, "let’s go."

"Good," Rhaine replied simply, nodding her approval."And you have a cabin?" Ammon’s face was grim, and he was smiling broadly.

"Yes," he replied simply.

"A place of rest and relaxation. With the cabin you’ be for awhile."

"What are you talking about?" the man asked, his usual conspiratorial air evened out."A place of rest and relaxation," Rhaine answered.

"And with the help of the locals, we’ll all be able to play by the same set of rules."

"And with the knowledge that you’re able to leave, then," he added, "you can go out and rest, and with the knowledge that the local people will respect your wishes and will let you rest in their beds, you’ll find a new way to rest."

"And with the knowledge that you’re able to heal yourself, why would you need to heal someone else?"Rhaine paused and considered the question. She was unsure of whether she was asking for her entire party, or if she had more questions for all of them.

"My question is more personal. How often do you heal someone?"

"Often?" he replied, a blush creeping into his cheeks.

"Sometimes I wonder why that is."

"And why do you ask?"

"I can’t say."

"You can’t heal someone else."

"I can only heal myself."There was a flash of realization in Rhaine’s gaze and her eyes widened.

"Are you...  Are you dead?"

"No!" the Doomguide replied with a snort.

"She’d lost her mind and would have died if I hadn’t been there."A wave of realization washed over Rhaine, her heart throbbing with emotion.

"You...  you have my love... "She could hear the words slowly turning in her mind’s hand, yet the tears flowed so freely, flowing down her cheeks like flowing waves. There were tears too, flowing down her face like water.

"Your soul...  your spirit... "They slid away from each other, though, and Rhaine could see the tears of her friends still stinging her eyes. The priestess was just the vessel for her soul."I wish that were the case, Rhaine, I could make it work," Grobnar said, embracing her fiercely.

"If you want it to, then go."

"I don’t care where you are," Rhaine replied, putting her hand to her hip.But the Doomguide’s hands were still raw with the desire of vengeance in them."I know," Grobnar said, taking her hand firmly.

"I know. I know. Do it."She let Rhaine hold her hand, and there was nothing she could do to stop Angel.The fighter held up a hand, and Rhaine looked back at the defector.

"I will take her to her destination," she said simply, lifting her hand to stop her opponent’s momentum.

"We will be at her aid, and she will aid us."Rhaine nodded.

"All of you, from the men to the High Father’s side, join me in thanking the Lord High Father for his blessing."------------------------------------------------------Elanee and Rhaine went to the sanctum, where they watched the sunrise. The priestess was flabbergasted at the beauty of the sun. The land was beautiful. It was pitch-black, like the night sky, and it was only the second time in memory that the night sky had been illuminated. It was stunning. A day filled with silvery stars, summer days filled with reds and greens, and cold and snowy nights. She was glad she was here. She was ready.

"You were very careful," She said to him as she turned the corner of the room and let out a heavy sigh.

"I am so sorry to be here."

"I am so sorry, I’m sorry," He said, leaning over and gently touching her cheek gently.

"I am so sorry."

"You are so kind, she said, nodding.

"But I’m going to miss you so much, too."She smiled a warm smile.

"I’ll never forget you, Babolax."

"I know," he said, a smile even more warm now than when she had last seen him.

"I never thought I’d say this to say goodbye."

"You’re going to miss him," she said, looking at him with wide, curious eyes.

"You’ll only be able to see him when he’s away, right?"

"He’ll never see her again, she said, pulling her phone from her pocket and dialing "1244" from her number. The drow gestured her toward the side of the road she had kept in the spirit barrow, which closed behind her and became her practice space.

"You’re not coming back for more, you know." He laughed, and glanced sideways at her.

"I’ll never, ever," he said, meaning it.

"That’s over for you. I can’t see you again, though, unless you permanently leave me."

"I don’t think I can."

"You never say never, asshole she said, nodding her agreement.

"I’ve been waiting for this."

"Who’s the big fat one?" Gaelira plunged a finger into the goblin’s ass, though the insult was surely aimed at her.

"You’ve lived in the Wood long enough. Not that it matters, mind you," she explained.

"You’ll never leave."

"What’s your name?" Gaelira questioned, squeezing the goblin’s head.

"I’ll never call you that."

"Don’t be silly, priestess," the goblin replied, brushing his teeth and wiping a tear from his forehead.

"I’m calling you by your name."

"A priestess," Rhaine amended.

"You have no name."

"Yes," the goblin answered with a snigger.

"I’m calling you by your full name."

"A goddess, you say?"Rhaine was surprised at her own reaction, and she took a breath to breathe. She didn’t know what to make of it.

"A name, a goddess."

"Yes," the goblin finally answered.

"And you."The Doomguide took a deep breath and then smiled.

"I look forward to our next task – to eliminate your kind."

"Very well, keep going," the Red Wizard replied with a smile.

"Until the sun rises, I will be nothing more than a walking statue to Mephasm."

"I’ll be here in a minute," Rhaine answered with a tired nod of his approval.

"The Beacon is ready. Now head southbound on Sunken Vat and head northbound on Lost Portal."

"And when the sun rises, we both return to Highcliff," he added with a nod."And thank you, Safiya, for her guidance little girl’s smile widened.

"That helped me a lot."Upon hearing that, Safiya leaned forward.

"I can’t believe it."Rhaine smiled warmly, and she did not doubt that she had saved her a life. It was a small thing, but she was glad that it had helped her forget her wounds more thoroughly. It did nothing to diminish the shock and pain when she felt several fingers tap her injured side.

"Thank you, Safiya."Rhaine’s head was still swimming, and she tried to focus on the small things. The small things were the things. She had been for a while. Certainly not a long time. She was only sixteen when she had met Amie. The couple had been lovers. The twins were mere months older than her. 

 "What did you do, little rabbit?" Dorian said, reaching for the Nein that were sitting beside him.

 "I wasn’t a rabbit," Dorian said, rubbing his neck.

"I was a dancer."

 "Why did you dance with the twins?" Dorian asked, resting his hand on the Nein’s shoulder.

 "Because they were trampy dancers," Dorian said, rubbing his neck.

"Trampy dancers!"

"That’s why I brought you in," Natasha said, raising her eyebrows.

"Why are you bringing me here?"

"Because you’re a tramp," Dorian shrugged, rubbing his neck.

"I’m just bringing you back to the backstage area again."

"I don’t need to bring you back here," Natasha groaned.

"I’m sorry."

"You didn’t have to say that," Dorian said, raising his eyebrows.

"I mean, I know you do," he said, rubbing his neck.

"I can imagine that you’ve spent the last two decades in the midst of a rebellion, with the orders of a significantly higher court...  I’m not sure what they’re capable of."

"Well," Caleb said tightly. He held the book tightly in front of him, letting it fester in his throat.

"I have no trouble with you, am I wrong?"

"Not at all," Caleb said.

"Just a bit of inexperience."

"Perhaps you’re right," he said.

"I cannot imagine that you’ve been thrown into a far more dangerous situation than our own.
