At the age of 13, Irae sent word to several high profile people of interest in joining us for the festivities. A number of them were women of color, but most were only interested in continuing their studies or to aid in their church. Irae advised that they all be brought to us by one of the members of the church – or, at least, a member of the priest’s ship. We would be assigned to escort the children to the church. Irae’s group would be led by a female member of the group, and the third by a male. The youngest man would be the female priestess.She explained that the youngest member of her group was imprisoned for a time, but she wanted to leave. So, she had recruited a bit of a meek Sam in order to do just that. She was a slightly older woman than Caleb, but Sam was her bodyguard. She was a very gentleness around men, very kind. She would often bring up the fact that they were ambushing her on the street or in her apartment, or on the roof or anywhere else where they could get a good view of her. She wasn't into violence, but she knew that Caleb would be. She had heard about the rise of organized crime in the city, and she was eager to help.

Caleb was annoyed that she was upset, but he was also irritated that she was panicking. He had been watching her the entire time. She was so used to being the one to call the other in. He had always been there for her. He knew that. She could tell when she was frustrated, and when she was struggling. She had always liked to be upset, but now it was just normal. 

 "Hey, you don't look good." Ashton growled and hissed. He was at the foot of his bed now, and looked like a half-drow again from the look on their faces.

 "No." They said and smiled. They were so close. They had come for me so often. I think they were already better than the rest. 

 I have a bad habit.

 She said, and pulled her hood up over her eyes, closing her eyes again. She was a sobbing mess now. I stripped down to tinker with some of those things. It wasn’t until I saw the bruise on her face I realized what had happened. I stripped down and started hacking away at something else. It took me a second to figure out what had happened. She had been hacking at something, but it hadn’t been her hacking at the ground like I had guessed. It was something else. Something heavier. Maybe...  She hadn’t been able to see it. It was like she hadn’t been there. All of a sudden it hit her. It was like hitting a brick wall. She screamed and went limp."You can’t believe she went down," Kiran whispered."I can’t," Elias murmured.Elias grabbed her by the shoulders and pulled her to the bed. He leaned in and kissed her deeply, burying his face in her neck gently. Her eyes rolled back and she could see her cheeks now. Her cheeks were soft and slightly flushed, slightly swollen.

"I’m sorry," he whispered."You can’t do this," she whispered."I can," he whispered again.

"Like you said, you can’t change this. You can’t change this."

"You can’t change this!" Rhaine exclaimed in sheer exasperation.The drow frowned.

"I am sorry, I’m sorry."She shook her head.

"I am sorry. It is my turn to depart," she said, gesturing to the group.

"I must depart."

"You can go," Casavir said again, gesturing with his hand.

"And I will return with you, if you wish."Rhaine nodded, shaking her head again.

"Thank you."

"Thanks," he said, holding up his hand again.

"You’re welcome."

"That was quite the escort," Natasha said with a smile.

"I was just waiting for you, and you said quite a few things about watching out for house rules."

"Well," he said, looking her up and down again, "what did you say? I didn’t say anything."

"Nothing, Natasha, just...  little," Natasha said, lowering her hand again.

"What’s your name?"

"I dunno," he said.

"What’s your name? Shulkyr?"

"You’re a dwarf she said gently.

"My name is Lenna."

"Well," he said, "how are you supposed to know my name?"

"I don’t know."

"What are you supposed to know?" she asked."I don’t know." He stared at her for a long moment.

"Shulk, you do know my name."

"What do you mean?"

"I don’t know what you mean," she said softly.

"I mean, look at me, I don’t know-" He hesitated.

"You think I a coward?" She shook her head, a smile growing into one.

"Nothing like the one you flaunted on your bed one night, you know. You know you’re not going to make it stop."

"Well," she said, letting out a long breath.

"I won’t stop."

"That’s the promise that you make every time you step here. You’re the best thing to ever happen to me."

"Now listen up, all of you." She held her hand out towards him.

"You are the best thing to ever happen to me."She smiled.

" are my mother, my father, my sister. I will always be your mother."

"I don’t need your help," the man said, standing up.

"I can’t see you crying," he continued, interrupting the pair.

"You’re being forced to watch your face like you are nothing more than a worthless piece of garbage."

"You’re right," he said, and there was a long pause.

"I’m sorry."

"You’re right," Rhaine said, face stiff.

"I’m sorry."

"I’m sorry," Ammon said flatly.

"I did not mean to sound defiant," Rhaine said.

"But you were right. I regret everything, now."

"I may have missed your life, but I couldn’t help but notice you had a time," Ammon said grimly, leaning back in his chair with his hands folded over his face as he tapped the remote on the remoteless remoteless side of the living room table.

"I just needed to know what you thought of me, you know. I did not expect to see you put your face in my mouth."

"What do you mean?" Rhaine asked, face hard. mean, look at my face," he continued, "it’s like spitting on your face. It’s like spitting on a pancake."

"Is that so?" Rhaine murmured, her voice sounding almost like a broken egg."That’s right," he replied with a smile.

"I like it."------------------------------------------------------‘Ah...  the Sun’s Gift!’Rhaine was overwhelmed by all the information she had. The Quests, the Dunmer’s Den, the town gossip, even the books themselves! They knew! And they swam! They swam! They swam. And they died! And it was over!" He paused.

"And they woke up and it was the same dream I had before."

"What did they dream of?" the woman asked."A night of dreams," Rhaine answered with a snort.

"Dreams that were real. That was the night I woke up and it was the same."

"Real dreams? What dreams?"Safiya shook her head in disbelief.

"You mean dreams of death?"

"Real dreams," the sorceress explained, inclining her head.

"Dreams that were real. Real dreams, were dreams that were real. Real dreams, were dreams that were real. Real dreams, were dreams that were real."Safiya’s eyes grew heavy and her countenance went black with shock.

"What?"

"Real dreams!" the Doomguide’s voice was steady, her heartbeats easy as she caught the words floating through her mind.

"Real dreams!"She nodded.

"Real dreams, were dreams that were real. Real dreams, were dreams that were real. Real dreams, were dreams that were real. Real dreams, were real dreams, were real dreams."At that, Safiya suddenly jerked forward, her hands dropping to her sides and sheathing her hands in the back of her head.

"You want to go back to your room?" Her tone was stern, but very genuine. She knew that if he let her take a nap she would make him feel better, so she could remind him of his duties and to sleep.

"You’re not sleeping," a voice said, and she could feel her head on the bed. She blinked, not awake, but asleep. She still had a bit of a dream, but it was a bit brighter and more disturbing now. She didn’t remember waking up in the morning, but her head was still on the bed, and so was her head in her pillow." sorry," she whispered, pulling her head to her side in pain.

"I was trying to take you in. I thought you might want to know what happened."

"I...  I didn’t want to do anything to... " Rhaine looked over at her, leaning back in her bed and frowning.

"But I did have a request."

"So, what do you have to do now?" he asked, suddenly very uncomfortable."I can do a few things for you," she answered, twisting her head towards him and turning her head to the side.

"But I think I can make it pretty." tried to ask her what she thought about it before she said, "Well now I don’t like it." He turned to face her."Then what do you want?"

"I don’t know." She said, looking up at him.

"You could tell me."He ignored his expression, looking down at his erection.

"If you want, I can do that."At that, Imogen turned away from him and glared at him.

"Fine. Let’s see what I’ve got going on about.
