The week has finally arrived! I have been diligently hunting for a cure for the curse of the living. I had been in the midst of trying to find a way to turn this curse on itself, so I had gone through the usual suspects, but I had come up empty. I’m not sure how I could have gone wrong, and now that I’ve found out how the curse works, I’m glad I didn’t! I’m getting the hang of it though, because I might be the only one who can! As I’m led, I try to make sure I don’t get tossed around. I’m getting flustered and think I have a good idea. I’m trying to get something out of you."

"You know, I don’t think anyone would judge you if you were a half-elf," Natasha said flatly."I’m sorry," Rhaine said, pressing a deep kiss to her lips.

"I’m hoping you don’t mind. I’m sure you don’t want to be a hypocrite, or worse, a fool. But you do have a point."

"Yeah," Natasha said, biting her lip.

"I’m not. I don’t think that’ fair."

"Then why does she talk like that all the time?"

"Because she’s got a face," Elanee remarked.

"She’s a face that’s been lost, and she’s seen what happened. She’s seen how it turned out."

"She’s not a face," Natasha said, curling a hand.

"She’s seen what happened. She’s seen what didn’t happen."

"She’s a face," Elanee assured.

"And she’s seen what we did."

" happened?" Rhaine inquired."Something happened," Elanee explained, "and she ran out of stones and was killed."

"Who did she?"

"We didn’t kill her," Casavir answered.

"I brought her back to you and told her who I was going to find."

"And who did she find?"

"Who did she kill?"

"Casavir and I were looking for a small village near the river, a place of worship."

"Why did you find a small village here?"

"It was a small village," Elanee explained "And the only thing they know of this place is that it is under the sway of the Thayi."

"What are they doing here?" Sam asked."We had heard of a strange creature that lived here first," Sam replied.

"They say it is a once-feared form of life, and that it was once the mistress of a strange house."

"She is very familiar with the area," Elanee added.

"I know she is not a resident."

"So, you are trying to investigate a once-dead form of life?" Sam asked."They do not know much about once-lived forms," Natasha warned."That is true," Sam said with a shrug. He walked back towards the Ceos.

"But I do believe we have a number of ancient necromantic techniques for one."

"And what are we searching for?" Sam inquired.The Doomguide’s brow furrowed.

"Dead forms."

"Not necromantic at all," Sam replied.

"Except you have come to the wrong place. We do not know what they are, and we are not trained necromantic practitioners here. It is no secret that we do not know much necromantic theory."

"Well," Natasha said, a slightly surprised flicker of amusement in her eyes, "we’re going to break the news to you in a minute. Don’t be late, or you risk getting eaten alive."The innkeeper froze. He looked her up and down, and he was smiling."Ah," he said, his smile warm, "I thought I might ask you about a subject I’ve been meaning to know about."

"Huh?" Natasha asked, a little perplexed at his presumptuousness."Well," he said with a little more amusement than she expected, "if there was something you needed to know, we could ask you."

"Who are you?" Dorian snapped, suddenly spinning and twisting in his chair."I am the bartender at the boys’ bar, and this is the name of his establishment, Maelstrom."

"Oh, gods, you’re a Mighty Nein," Pearl exclaimed, gesturing for the bartender to come inside."I have to ask, why are you so eager to start speaking with me?"

"Because I thought you might be able to help me understand a bit of the Mighty Nein," Pearl answered.

"Look, I know you don’t know everything about yourself, but if you’re interested in experiencing what it feels like to feel like a person, I’ll be glad to help!" He chuckled, heaving.

"I’ll be honest, I was hoping that I could take you in, and you’d probably be just as surprised at the sight as I was."

"And what about you?" Sam asked, looking over the group at her."Well, I really really wanted to be a part of it," she replied, looking over at him.

"I may have just started work on my next song, but that doesn’t mean I can’t see what you think of me. I’m just your average ‘imbecile’.

"Yeah! You’re right!" Alaine said, standing up to the Wall.

"Look, I don’t think you’re done to me in a long time." She glanced down at her feet and looked back up to Rhaine.

"Why don’t you try it?"

"Eh," Keya said, holding out one hand to Rhaine.

"I think I’m the only one who can possibly do this."

"Do you know why you’re here?"

"I just...  I just...  I just thought maybe I’m going to die in a different way," Rhaine replied with a snort.

"But I found something. I don’t know if I can share it...  I just went in...  I just went into the others’ home, I didn’t know where else to go...  I just got home, I just tried to...  Got to go to the library, I just tried to talk with the other villagers, I just tried to talk to Dorian and Gann. I just tried to talk to Fjord, but they don’t have any books."The drow chuckled again, shaking his head at her.

"Duncan said he didn’t know anything about that he explained, inclining his head at her.

"I heard some stories he had. He didn’t know anything about it."

"And?" Rhaine inquired, her gaze darting to the queen’s side."And he didn’t know anything about it at all."

"Didn’t he tell you, queen?" Sand remarked with a smirk.

"This conversation is our responsibility, he didn’t say anything about it. He told us about the others, but he didn’t tell us anything about it."At that, Rhaine’s brow furrowed.

"So you don’t think you are an ally?"

"I’m not an ally," Safiya replied with a slight curl of her own.

"I’ve saved her life, and I’ve given her life to all of us."

"That’s...  that’s all!" Rhaine retorted.

"You are the only one who’ve saved her."

"And you have taken her life?" Safiya glared at her.

"You have destroyed everything she’s held dear? To her, her village, her love, her clan? All of them? Do you think you’ll be joining us?"

"Yes," the entourage replied, inclining their heads in silent agreement.

"I do not think so."

"We are all adventurers," Casavir added.

"We do not travel alone in this world."

"The truth is more important than ever," Rhaine replied, inclining her head in silent agreement.

"The truth is more important than ever."

"But," Casavir trailed.

"You are right. We are all bound together by the Sword of Gith. We all have something in common."

"And what is that something?" Rhaine asked, stepping closer to the small house in the center of the village.The little house was mostly empty save for for a few small belongings that looked like dried blood, half-melted scarlet paste. On either side of the door stood a small, haggard man with a comb resting on his head. His hair was still tied back in a bun and his beard a soft mask of a half-moon."If you ever need anything, I can come with you."The man gave Rhaine a faint smile, "But I can always come by the boat."

"I’m coming to... " She began, but he only continued, his voice cracking as he saw her.

" been waiting for this."

"He’s been waiting for it!" Natasha said, and then shook her head.

"I think he’s sincerely remorseful for his actions."

"I don’t think he cares," Rhaine said, firmly.

"He’s done enough harm that he has no remorse in doing what he did. But he did not commit the crime, and he has a duty to warn others of such things."

"And how can you?" Natasha asked, her tone almost reverent."I can only speak for all the others," Rhaine replied, shaking her head.

"You’re all fools. You think you’ve been watching this whole drama from the inside. You’re lying to yourself. You’re giving your people what they want and getting nothing. You’re a threat to the order and the whole order. To the gods, all you’re doing is strengthening the order. You’ll do anything to keep the lid on this," she added, gesturing to everyone present."And what of your rival?" Safiya asked, half of her face twisted into a frown.Rhaine glared, then took a swig of her beer.

"I can’t imagine a scenario in which your actions and the way you play the roles make you unworthy to be a knight or queen."

"That’s a fair point," Rhaine said, trying to be as diplomatic as possible.

"I’ll speak with Sinthea afterwards."

"What if Sinthea doesn’t want me to speak with you," the Doomguide said, somewhat reluctantly.

"Or, she’s not so concerned."

"Of course she is," Sinthea said eventually, putting a hand on her hip.

"She’s not the only one who fears you."

"Yes," Rhaine replied.
