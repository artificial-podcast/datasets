So what was she doing working in a tea parlour, anyway?".He sounds nervous. He’s been in the same room as everyone else, and they’ve known each other for years. He has a strong suspicion that she’s been doing this for years."M... I’ve been in this room for thirty years, too," he’s all over the place. He’s never seen her before. She’s been almost flawless since the time she was twelve. She got to be honest, I was a bit confused."

"Are you the only one who can see that?"

"I’m not sure," Ron said, reaching into his robes and pulling Harry out of his jeans.

"It’s not like I haven’t been to a ball where I can see."

"Are you the only one who remembers that?"

"I don’t know. When we were seventeen, Mum and Dad started to give us to the first cousins of our family, and I started to believe it was the only way to save our world. At least I did, until Draco took off with the twins, and we were all a bit scared. I was really scared at first, but then I started to get the hang of it. I was just trying to protect my family and to protect my own. I was just trying to be a decent role model to my entire family. I'd think it would be an honor to share it with them. I'd like to thank you, as much as I could, for being your brother."I'd like to thank you for being my brother." He said, shaking his head.

"I know you're a bit of a git, but I was being a smart, honest person. I thought I was just doing my best to be the best person for you. I'm proud of you though. You're a good person, I think, but you're also... you know, if I ever get hurt or have a conflict, I'm going to be a better person."Hermione looked up at him and swallowed hard as she told him that she was not doing anything to make him more happy, but that she would do anything to make him happy."I understand that he's going to be a better person if I ever get hurt."

"I know," he ground out, his voice hoarse, "but I just don't know how to live with myself."

"I don't want to . . . I don't want to hurt you. I don't want to hurt any of you."

"I'm sorry, Harry," she whispered, her voice soft and calm.

"I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you're hurt, that you're . . . you're . . . you're . . . you're . . . you're . . . you're . . . you're . . . you . . . . you're . . . . you're . . . . you're . . . . you're . . . you're . . . you're . . . . you're . . . ., Dr. . . . . you're . . . . you're . . . . . you're . . . . . . you're . . . . . you're . . . . ., Dr. . . .
