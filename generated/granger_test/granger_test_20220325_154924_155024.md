Luna was ticklish near her armpits.

"I’m not going to let you down again."

"I’ll try."

"So, I’ll try."

"You get rid of me, Luna."

"You’ll keep it to yourself."

"I’ll keep it to myself."

"I don’t want to lose you."

"I don’t want to lose you."

"I do."

"I don’t want to lose you."

"I don’t want to lose you."

"I don’t want to lose you."

"I don’t want to lose you," he growled, his eyes water with rage.

"I’m sorry, I’m sorry."He placed a hand on her shoulder, trying to get closer to her.

"I don’t want to lose you," he growled, his voice sharp.

"I can’t seem to lose you."

"I can’t seem to get you."

"I can’t seem to get you."

"I don’t want to lose you," he growled, his voice sharp.

"I’ sorry."

"I’m sorry," she said, looking away as she looked at him.

"What’s wrong with you?"

"I’m sorry for what happened. I’m not going to tell anyone about it," he said, shaking his head.

"I’ll do it."She’s not going to be quiet for another hour. He took her wrist and placed her hand on the back of his neck.

"Take it."

"I’ll do whatever you want," he said, kissing her forehead.

"It’s not like you’ll be the one to get upset about this."Hermione’s eyes widened and she nodded.

"I’m sorry, Draco. I’m not a big fan of your aggressive methods."

"I’m not," Draco said, "I don’t think you’ll mind."Hermione winced and shook her head, "I’ll be fine. I just want to see if you’ll be alright with me tonight."

Harry looked at her, the man’s eyes sparkling with a smile and a look of genuine amazement.

"I’ll be fine," he murmured, "I’ll see you at dinner, yeah?"

Hermione nodded.

"I’ll see you at dinner."

"Okay," he said, a little voice in his ear. He seemed to be annoyed that Hermione didn’t believe him. The way he seemed to be ignoring her, he really didn’t look like that.

"Do you want to make the dinner?"

"Yes," she said, shaking her head.

"I think I’ll just go with you, and then think about what you’d say to me."

"So, Draco muttered, "I think I’ll just say it." Open a little eye, and see where this is going. You’re as good as dead, like I’m telling you." Draco stared at the two of them for a second, "I don’t think I’ll ever make it to your office." Draco didn’t say anything, but, "I’ll just come up with a different way, but it’ll be my way." Draco hated the idea of that. He’d become a fucking Death Eater. He’d been trying to get to me for years. He’ tried to get back to me because he’d been chosen to be my friend. He’d attempted to get me out of the past and I’d tried to get myself out of it and I’ve had enough of him."

Hermione’s head snapped up, a smile on her face.

"And now he’s a Death Eater. He... "

"He’s our best friend. And he’s been the one who’s helped me get out of this mess."

"We’re trying to get him out of this mess."

"He’s trying to keep him out of this mess." The man’s voice sounded like a challenge.

"You’re not going to tell this to me."

"I’m not going to tell you."

"You won’t."

"We’ll just have to keep this up."

"Fine, then."

"Fine." The man took another deep breath.

"I’ll just have to sort this out." He took another deep breath.

"You know, I care for you."

"You’ll never come out of this," Ginny said, holding a hand on Harry’s hair and saying, "I’m sorry." He nodded, moving his arm toward her, then toward her.

"You never told me you’d be coming out," Ginny said sternly, her voice soft.

"You haven’t told me." He held out a hand, and she smiled up at him. She was looking at him with a weak smile on her face.

"I’m not coming out." She left the room, pulling Harry’s hair and running her hand through his platinum blonde locks.

"I’m... I’m not going to leave you if you don’t. I’m—I’m not leaving you."

"What?" Adelaide cried, looking back at the redhead.

"What did you say you were going to leave that night?"

"I’m not leaving you."

"You’re not leaving me!"

"I’m not leaving you!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You not leaving!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me!"

"You’re not leaving me! are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me! are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me!"

"You are not leaving me! are not!"

"You are not!"

"You are not!"

"You are not!"

"I cannot leave!"Draco’s voice sounded cold as she dropped her wand.

"I have a way out."

"I am not leaving you."Draco’s gaze snapped to her.

"I am closing in on you."Draco lowered his wand, and Hermione shuddered.

"I am."

"I am trying!"Draco’s eyes began to pool with tears.

"I am trying!"

"I will not!"

"You are my home now, Draco!"

"I’ll never let you go!"Draco crumpled into his seat, tears now streaming down his face.

"I want you so badly I’ll never let you go!"Draco held his hand out to Hermione, his wand silent.

"I will not!"

"I’m not going to leave!"

"I’m not leaving!"

"I’m not leaving!"Draco held the wand out to her, slowly pulling a chair towards the exit.

"I’m not leaving!"

"I be right back. I’ll be right back." Hermione said not looking up, but then turned her head towards the back of the room, taking in a breath. It was a good thing the door was locked."Hermione, it’s not going to happen." Harry said, looking at her with an expression that said everything she needed to say.

"I’m not leaving, no one will."

"No one?" Hermione asked.

Harry smiled a bit, then glanced at her.

"I’m not leaving either."

"No one?" Hermione asked, her voice soft and calm.

"No one." She took his hand and dropped it, letting the rest of his hand stay on her chest. She didn’t move a muscle.

"Just leave." She didn’t say anything, just stepped back and let her eyes scan the room.

"I’m leaving." She didn’t say anything again.

"I’m not leaving either." She wasn’t sure how to respond, but she didn’t care. As soon as she’d left, she ran to her car and the door opened. She was surprised to find a tall man standing outside the car, not looking like he’d been hit by a car, but a man with a tall, dark brown hair, with a long, rich nose. The man looked to the man for help, but it didn’t matter, he wasn’t going to hurt the man.

"This is a bit dangerous," the man said.

"I think it’s best for you to leave."

"I’ll be right here," the man said.

"No need," the woman said, looking to the man and his wife.

"It’s a private place," the man said, a little hesitantly.

 private," Ginny mumbled, her eyes widening a little.

"It’s all private."The man stared at her with a questioning look.

"Harry said the place was private, but it’s a private place." Ginny said.

"He said it’s a private place. It’s private."Ginny nodded.

"I’m sure he’s not. I don’t know anything about it." She said.

"It’s been a long time." He said, his voice no more serious than he had been before.

"It’s been a long time," He said, "and you need to push it even more."

"You started this and then you got out and then you got your arse... " Hermione sighed, tears welling in her eyes.

"I'm sorry, I’m a pain in the ass. I’m not going to forgive you." He said, his voice softer.

"I understand." She said slowly, her voice low and thin.

"I’m not going to do anything." She said softly, her voice softer.

"You’re not." He snapped, " not." She said, her voice strained. He sighed, looking away. He’d gotten himself into so much trouble if he didn’t stop her right there. He could feel her eyes on him.

"No." He said, taking a bit longer to process.

"I’m not."She looked at him, trying to calm down and he picked up the pace of her.

"You’re not." He said again, shaking his head. He could feel her eyes on him.

"No, you’re not." She said, stepping back and looking at him.
