Luna was ticklish near her armpits, and she had trouble keeping her eyes closed and keeping her mouth shut. He had been trying to make up for her, but she felt her face turn red, her breathing grow heavier.

"Oh, my god!" He’s calling me.

"You are not going to hurt me." He says again.

"I’m sorry," She says, not wanting to do this again.

"I’m sorry I forced you to do this, and I’m sorry I did that to you." She says again.

"I’m sure I’ll do it once I realize that I didn’t tell you be fine." He pushed her off the bed, closing the door behind her and placing a hand on her shoulder.

"I know you’ll be fine,"

"I know." She let him lean in, "I’m sorry,"

"You’ll be fine." He kissed her forehead, "I know."

"I know." He kissed her for a moment, pulling her into his arms.

"I’m sorry."

"I’m sorry," She shook her head.

" wasn’t meant to be in this position."

"I’m sorry I didn’t want to hurt you," He ran his tongue over her hair, making her smile.

"I’m sorry I didn’t want to be hurt."

"I’m sorry I didn’t want to be hurt," He smiled back.

"I’m sorry I didn’t want to be hurt." She sniffled slightly.

"I apologised," He said slowly.

"I’m sorry I didn’t want to be hurt," He shrugged.

" just worried about the kid."

"He’s a lovely kid," Ginny said, smiling brightly.

"He’s been freaking out about you all this year."

"He’s a very special kid," Hermione said, grinning at the pair.

"But he’s a smart, kind, funny boy and healthy."

"Nope, he’s a smart, kind boy too," Ginny said, smiling at the twins.

"He’s smart."

"You’re a smart, kind boy too," Hermione said, smiling back.

"He’s a smart."

"You’re a smart, kind boy too," Draco said, his lips quivering, "He has good taste in women."Hermione smiled, feeling her heart swell.

"I’m so proud of you, Draco," she said, breaking the kiss.Draco’s mouth moved, moving faster to her.

"I’m so proud of you, too."

"I’m so proud of you, too, too," Hermione said, shaking her head."I’m not even capable of putting you down for a minute."Draco pushed her against him, moving her closer to the wall.

"I’m sorry, I was just trying to be brave and try to make you feel better."Hermione clenched her jaw.

"Not anymore."Draco laughed.

"You’ll be alright."She sniffed.

"I’m okay," he said, pulling her close.

"I’m a good person."He kissed her again, the warmth radiating off of her."I’m okay," she breathed, "I’m fine." He kissed her again.

"I’m not going to hurt you."Hermione’ eyes snapped up to meet his.

"I’m fine," he said and kissed her again, "I’m not going to hurt you." She smiled at him.

"I’m fine."

"I’ll see you soon," He said."I’ll see you soon, Ron."

"I’ll see you soon," She smiled. Her eyes snapped up to meet his.

"I’m sorry to interrupt, but I’m not going to hurt you, Harry."

"I’m not going to hurt you." He kissed her again.

"Fuck you." She breathed against his lips.Harry felt his heart clench in his chest.

"This is not going to work – I’m not going to hurt you!" She pushed his hair back to her face.

"You’re not going to hurt me, just tell me what happened and I’ll be okay." She stood up and turned to watch him leave.

"I’ll fucking tell you," he growled, pulling her from the bathroom. He ran out of the bathroom, down onto the floor, and reached for her hand in his."You’re going to fucking kill me." She whispered.He looked up at her.

"You’re fucking kidding me," he growled.She raised her chin, looking over at him.

"You’re not fucking killing me."

"You’re killing me." She’s a fucking idiot

"You’re fucking killing me."

"You fucking arsehole." He grabs her hand and tries to pull her from her thoughts, but she’s too busy making sure that nothing happens to him."I’m sick of you." She cries."You’re fucking sick of me." She forces herself to look at him, unable to help herself."You shouldn’t." Ron’s eyes drop."You’ve been so fucking sick I’m not paying attention." Hermione’s voice is quiet.

"I’m not, but you’re not taking it well."

"And you’re not taking it well?"

"You’re not taking it well." Ron’s eyes snap shut.

"I’m not taking it well."

"Maybe you’re right, but you’re not taking it well with me."

"Maybe." Ron blinked.

"I’m not going to help you, Hermione."Hermione’s face softened. She nodded.

"You know, the way everything is going, I’m not going to do anything to hurt you. I mean, I’m not stopping you, I’m not stopping you from doing anything to harm you."

"You’re not stopping me from doing anything, are you?"

"No," Ron said quickly, shaking his head.

"I just want you to be happy that you’re okay."

"You’re not," Hermione said.

"You’re asking me to go away. I know you’re angry with me, maybe you’ll leave."

"I’ll be fine," he said, grinning."You know I’m not angry with you," she said, looking scornfully at him.

"I’m not a total bitch," she said."I’m not," he said.

"I’m an old-fashioned man."

"You’re not a bloody old-fashioned man," she said.

"You’re a partner in the Ministry. You’ve been here for over two years. have a lot to live for," Draco said as he looked up at her.

"Now spend your time down there."

"I suppose you don’t mind."

"I don’t mind."

"I’m not a doting parent."

"I’m not."

"I’m sorry. I’m sorry we’ve all been so busy. I’m sorry it’s been just a few days."

"I’m sorry all of us were so busy."

"Quite."

"I’m sorry, I’m not sure how you felt."

"You, for one, don’t have to worry about that at all."

"I know what you’re saying."

"I’m sorry for all of it," he said with a small laugh.

"I’m sorry for how much I hate you."

"I’m sorry for all of it," she said quickly.

"I don’t want you to feel bad."

"I don’t want you to feel anything."

"I’m sorry for everything."

"I know what I going to do to you, but I’m not going to do it to you."

"I’m not going to do anything to you either."

"I’m sorry you had to go through with it."

"You know what I want you to do," she says.

"I want you to do it."

"I want you to do it to me."

"I’m sorry I haven’t wanted to do it to you."

"I’m sorry I didn’t want to do it to you."

"I’m sorry I didn’t want that to you."

"I’m sorry I didn’t want to do it to you."

"I’ll be honest with you."

"You don’t have to do it to me or anyone else."

"You don’t have to do anything to me."

"You don’t have to do anything to me."

"I’ll be honest with you,"

"You don’t have to do anything to me."

"I’ll be honest with you."

"I’ll be honest with you."

"I not taking your word for it," he said, interrupting her."Do you want me to tell you what I said to you?"She nodded.

"I just wanted to let you know that I want you to be safe."

"I want you to be safe."

"What?"

"I want you to be safe."

"You’re not safe."She looked at him.

"I’m not safe."

"I’ll be honest with you."

"I’m not safe."

"I’ll be honest with you. not safe."

"I don’t know anyone who’s been through this," she sighed, pulling the sleeves of her light blue dress up and stretching her legs out over the bed, "I’m not safe. You may not have known this was coming, but I’m not your typical ‘roundish’ teenager."She pulled her hair behind her ear and twisted her head until she found herself sitting up.

"I’m not your typical roundish teenage girl."

"I don’t know."She began to sigh, but when she looked up, he’d been sitting next to her, with his back to her, and she could feel his breath catching in his chest."I’ll be right back." She whispered, her heart pounding in her chest, and he looked up and down at her, feeling the same way."I’ll be fine." He sighed, and she could feel the tears in his eyes."I swear to Merlin – you’ll never forgive me." He whispered, and she could feel the tears in his eyes."I swear to Merlin – I’m going to do whatever you say." She whispered, her voice soft, almost soft as she pulled away."Ron, I know you’ve never heard," Hermione said, a little nervous, "but I’m glad you did. I’m just glad you’re okay with this."

"I said that you should give Ron a chance," Ron said, a little worried.

"He’s suspended, and I’m letting him go."

"I’m not letting you go," Hermione said, her voice soft, almost soft as she lifted him onto her shoulder.

"Ron, I’m so sorry that you’ve hurt him," she said, her eyes sparkling with tears as she lifted him onto her lap He was so swollen and bruised, but calming down had been worth it.He looked up at her, his eyes bright and hot as he looked up at her. He looked at her with a gentle smile."I love you," she whispered, her voice soft and unyielding.

"I have missed you."He sighed, and reached out for her other hand.

"I love you. I'm just." He tucked it behind her ear and rested it against her chest.Granger sighed and pulled back, her head resting against his chest.

"I know," she whispered, holding onto him tightly as he continued to cry."I love you, too," he whispered, his voice soft and reserved.
